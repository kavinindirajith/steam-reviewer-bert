25000,"If you like long drives on straight roads going past farms, this is the DLC for you. Besides all the farms and small towns, there are some deliveries to be made to gas stations.

Nebraska just doesn't have any real landmarks, but if you go in expecting a farming state, you get that. What there is to map has been mapped and it looks really good.

After playing some more and doing the entire World of Trucks event to explore the state I have some issues though. None of the scenic towns have town markers! I passed through places like Red Cloud and Thedford but they don't have a town sign anywhere, and aren't mentioned on the road shields.

The alignment of some roads is also off. The 6 in Lincoln for example manages to run north-south for a part, whereas IRL it is almost entirely a south-west to north-east road.

I guess some of this may be corrected later but it seems this DLC was not completely finished before release.

Still, if you like ATS, you will probably get this now if not soon simply for the fact it gives you more to drive on, and allows for more connections between Wyoming, Colorado, and Kansas.",1

25003,"After driving through the whole state. I feel this DLC could do with a few more misc highways around the map. You missed Lincoln Highway (US 30) from Grand Island to North Platte which is a scenic alternative to the boringness of I-80. The tri-cities are a major area of Nebraska that weren't done justice here. Sure, Grand Island looks great but Kearney isn't represented outside of the Archway and Hastings doesn't even exist, which is crazy to me since Hastings is where kool-aid was invented.

What little is here is good though. I just hope SCS could update the DLC with some more roads.",1

25007,"A fun rhythm game played as crazy pigeons. I am having fun with it. The only problem if its really much of a problem. People need to learn to have some patience! Their timer at the start is 2 minutes or 30 people/pigeons. It will get down to 10 seconds and people still leave. If you don't mind playing against bots most rounds, then it's not really an issue. The bots are not over powered at all I would say. I just thought I would mention this because this is a bit annoying right now. And the lobby doesn't seem to fill back up as people leave. I hope they fix that. All of their clothing items/voices/ect. are in game currency (crumbs), no money shop in game. They have a DLC for some outfits, and it's a decent amount of outfits. I like their way they are doing this game so far. If you have decent rhythm. Give it a go.",1

25010,"***UPDATE 10/10/23***
I stand by what I said below from WHEN I wrote it. Unfortunately ""Game_002"" has already been released, and that demonstrates to me that this developer is more interested in pushing short bites of what will inevitably become trash out the door than they are in growing their skills. As such, I can't really recommend this game (or any of their others) to the community.

This now changes from a thumbs up to a thumbs down from me.

***ORIGINAL***
Wow...this is the first time that I get to be the first person reviewing a game. Don't I feel special?!?

I'm not gonna lie, I really only bought this game BECAUSE I thought that it would be a train wreck, and I wanted to see just how bad that it is/was. On the store page, it just says ""Game_001"" where you add it to your cart. And I figured that if the devs have so little focus that they can't even name the thing, what hope is there for the game itself?

But on the other hand, when I make music, I don't always have a title for it. So I have a LOT of tracks that end up being something like ""23.09.21 Blues D#m - 92bpm"" so I get the naming convention the dev used. Although I think that it's ambitious to use ""_001,"" but I am curious as to what ""_069"" and ""_666"" end up being!

Here's the thing, I was pleasantly surprised by this game's story. Truthfully, I would give it a neutral score if I could. It's a KINETIC VISUAL NOVEL, and I don't really like those. There is NO ONE CHOICE for you to make, and the 74 minutes is how long it took for me to read it. There is ONE SEX SCENE, and it is NOT animated.

So the thumbs-up really only applies to people that don't mind those qualifiers.

What surprised me was the story itself. It's not outstanding, but it is intelligent. The story starts out spending a little time creating a likable relationship between the MC and the love interest. There isn't a LOT of emotional investment, but just enough to leave you rooting for them.

It's clearly a translation to English, but whoever did it almost certainly is a native speaker. I didn't see any actual spelling errors except for the fact that the MC is sometimes called ""John"" when his name is ""Josh"" and ""Elli"" is OFTEN called ""Ally.""

A few of the text boxes have confusing wording that had me backing up a few boxes in order to regain the context, but I have played MANY games that are more highly polished, with a WAY worse script.

I would like to see what this team (or person) could do with a larger story, choices, and branching paths. Maybe it would be a cluster-fuck, but I was at least slightly invested in these characters. And that's not something that happens for me very often in a kinetic novel.

Good job, and here's to ""Game_069"" and ""Game_666""!",0
25011,Sex game. Only one route. Get on discount.,1
25012,Not well designed. It's just a series of binary choices for one girl or the other.,0
25013,"decent system
Voice acting is rough
extremely short
results are one or the other",0
25014,"This game plays like an interactive video rather than a visual novel. The voice acting is a little stiff, but is otherwise well done. The dialogue is clever and realistic. The character interactions are well written, so there is no obvious ‚Äúthis person is better‚Äù bias. All three characters have lip sync that matches the voice acting pretty well.

Saves can be made at any time, but to properly continue a game after a load you need to go back to the last choice and continue from there. All the scenes are moderate in length, like normal brief conversations.

The choice system is simple. Make more choices for one girl and you get her ending. The storyline is short. I doubt many will spend more than a half hour per ‚Äúroute.‚Äù

The ending scenes are 18+ and are the same quality as those shown on the store page. The animated poses and camera angles are changed by using the ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key and are accompanied by voice acting that is reasonably natural.

Recommended, although the short story length leads me to suggest getting it on sale.",1

25018,shit,0
25019,"--This game has a lot of promise. It's mostly open-ended interrogations where you're typing in (usually outlandish) questions and accusations and the AI characters try to keep up. This feels much more natural than any AI-generated writing I've seen in a mystery game before, and clearly there's a huge opportunity here beyond what a writer can achieve with multiple-choice answers in a linear script like most standard mystery games use. 

The AI does a very good job rolling with questions predictable and unpredictable. For example, I found blood-stained gloves and my leading suspect admitted they were his. He had a suitably creepy and sometimes clever answer for these questions: 
----""It's warm weather out, why do you have gloves on set?""
----""What were your blood-soaked gloves doing in someone else's bedroom? You don't have to answer if you're like a midwife or something.""
----""Nostradamus foretold that these gloves would bring nothing but murder and syphilis. Have you been tested recently?"" 
----""You are wearing a t-shirt and shorts. Literally the only reason you have gloves is that you're a plumber or a serial killer, and I don't see any ****ing pipes on you."" 
----""If you talk back one more time, I will go off on you like Sherlock Holmes' dog playing fetch with his opium.""  
----""If you could say anything to the killer, what would it be? Also, pretend that it's someone else, obviously.""  
[b]If you enjoy confronting NPCs and pushing them to the limit with hallucinatory allegations and midwifing advice and doubtful sexual boasts, this is EXACTLY the mystery you will love. Otherwise, skip it, the cases are lame as hell on any sort of normal playthrough[/b].

--Evidence collection is a miss. It feels like I'm checking the same ~10 drawers over and over. 

--The player only gets asked to pick a killer, but there's only ~5 suspects in each case and only 1-2 of them have even the slightest motive. It's pretty thin. All of the cases I've seen are 100% solved on motive, which gets repetitive. In a more complex video game, a murder whodunnit might be a sequence of like 3-6 events (or even as many as ~12 for Donganronpa), and we eliminate some suspects or advance through the story by figuring out what happened in each stage. [spoiler](Maybe their alibi doesn't give them enough time to have committed the crime, or they're not physically capable enough to have strangled the victim, or aren't on good enough terms that the victim would have invited them in).[/spoiler] In this game, we have 0-event murders where the cause of death is not discussed, the time is not discussed, the crime scene is not discussed, even the player character is not discussed, all we have is establishing which suspect had a plausible motive to commit murder. It's more a proof of concept for AI dialogue than a whodunnit, I think. [spoiler]Disclaimer: I write mystery books for five year olds and I don't think even they would go for cases this thin. This game is much less about solving crimes, and more about confronting suspects with wild-eyed revelations and hallucinatory accusations, which frankly was a lot of fun.[/spoiler]. 

--In a game with more detailed cases, it'd be pretty common to ask questions beyond just who the killer is. For example, ""How did the killer get through the door?"" or ""Why didn't the dog bark?"" or ""Who is the killer's accomplice?"" In this game's cases, there's no dogs, no accomplices, no doors, the solutions are exceptionally thin. Like, you find a guy's bloody gloves, and he admits they're his, and that's enough to correctly accuse him of obviously being the murderer. :-/

--There are some unnatural dialogue moments where characters forget what they've told you. PRODUCER: there's been tension over script changes. ME: What script changes? PRODUCER: ""Script changes? What script changes?"" [b]But generally the AI does a good job maintaining internal consistency[/b].  

--Moving around the mansion is rough. The blur is so high, I blame the opium

--Game has crashed twice in 2 hours of playtime. Going up stairs is surprisingly difficult. Opening cabinets takes some getting used to.",0
25020,"So far the game is really interesting and fun to play, I can definitely see some interesting gameplays coming out of this. Initially I thought that I wouldn't get into it, to this point I've only played the first one, but It got me fixed to the point I really used all my time to get as many clues I could as I didn't want to miss it, and I was able to solve the murder, even tho it was not super easy. I'll definitely play the other stories, and I'm also curious about the potential of having different gameplays with the AI chat.",1
25021,"The idea, premise and promise of this game could have been great, but they completely ruined the experience with the dreaded timer!

25022,Game is got really great environment design and layout. No bugs ghosting through the walls or objects.

This game had great elements and I can enjoy both playing it and watching my friends try to figure it out. I definitely need to retry the game once I get an upgrade. I personally only got through the Ghost story before my computer crashed, but I'd love to try more endings. Having said that, please let Chelsea be a romantic interest in the (hopefully) sequel.

25026,"‚ÄúQuiet on Set‚Äù is not just a game; it‚Äôs a transformative experience that has redefined the murder mystery genre. With its intricate storytelling and immersive gameplay, it has the power to captivate and engage players on a profound level.

The game places you in the midst of a movie production in a grand mansion, where a sudden murder turns your role from a participant to a detective. The unique feature of ‚ÄúQuiet on Set‚Äù is its use of advanced AI technology to dynamically craft dialogue in real-time, ensuring no two experiences are the same. This level of personalisation has allowed players to deeply connect with the game, making it a comforting escape that can have a positive impact on one‚Äôs mental health.

The game‚Äôs ability to blend interactive fiction, adventure, and puzzle elements with a compelling narrative allows players to use their analytical skills to navigate through a storm of ulterior motives and agendas. The emotional investment in solving the mystery is significant, as each decision can lead to different outcomes, making the player an integral part of the story.

For those who have found solace in the world of ‚ÄúQuiet on Set,‚Äù it‚Äôs more than a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey through suspense and intrigue that offers a sense of accomplishment and emotional relief. It‚Äôs a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and its potential to touch lives beyond the screen.",1
25027,"I really like this  game! I think especially after playing the demo, this game has come a long way.  The AI chats have definetly been kind of frustrating and some of the doors have still gotten stuck, but I think over all this game has a lot of potential and is fun to play as long as you have plenty of downtime.",1
25028,"This is a game with more cons than pros, but what pros there are carry the whole thing.

Cons:
Lacks polish
Crashed two or three times during my first session playing it
Has a fair few bugs - sometimes you have to approach a character a couple of times before triggering their dialogue, sometimes there's no cursory on the end-game screen meaning you have to force close the game
Sometimes the AI goes off on crazy tangents, including an innocent character gleefully confessing to the murder
Sometimes difficult to get characters to actually answer the questions you put to them
Characters' AI can break so they won't respond at all
UI could be better and more intuitive
Some controls aren't mapped to the keys the intro tells you they are
Very sparse in-game options and could really do with some to modify the mouse sensitivity and motion blur

Pros:
Some of the stories at least are well laid out and a fun challenge to figure out
The biggest one of all is that the concept is fantastic and talking to/messing with the AI is a lot of fun

So yeah, expect a bit of a janky mess but if you go into it just wanting some silly fun with AI and a mystery to solve it's a good time.",1
25029,"We're tasked with solvin murders/crime in various scenarios. There is a solid number of scenarios. The game uses AI voice and chat to bring the various NPCs to life.

25032,"Quiet on Set is not just any ordinary video game; it's an immersive experience that has left an indelible mark on my life. Released by a small indie studio, this game captivated my imagination and transported me into a world where creativity knew no bounds. My journey with Quiet on Set began on a lazy spring afternoon. Intrigued by its unique concept, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know that it would become much more than just a game to me. As I delved deeper into the world of Quiet on Set, I found myself completely immersed in the creative process. The game challenged me to think outside the box, to experiment with different ideas, and to push the boundaries of what I thought was possible. Quiet on Set also taught me valuable life lessons that extend far beyond the realm of gaming. Every setback was an opportunity to learn and grow, every success a testament to the power of determination. Looking back, I am grateful for the profound impact Quiet on Set has had on my life. It ignited a spark within me, guiding me towards a path of creativity and self-discovery. Through its immersive gameplay and community spirit, it showed me that anything is possible with dedication and a little imagination. Quiet on Set isn't just a game; it's a transformative experience that will always hold a special place in my heart.",1
25033,"Absolutely awful. One of the worst games I have ever played. To begin with, this game is focused on wokeness and the advocacy of gender pronouns. By the time you reach the third case, speaking with characters gets confusing because they start referring to a single character as ""they"" and ""them."" I got into several heated conversations with these AI characters about why we are using gender pronouns to refer to a single character. And they all got down right angry at me with scowled faces as they informed me that this certain character identifies as non-binary and that I needed to be accepting of this immediately. While trying to ignore this aspect of the game I encountered several other issues such as the game crashing to the desktop after selecting a murderer, player movement being too fast, and cutscenes dropping the frame rate down into the 30s. And if you think it could be fun saying some inappropriate things to these AI characters, think again. They all reply by only telling you that you are being inappropriate and that's it. The graphics are also very outdated, there is only one graphic setting of low to high, you cannot remap the controls, there is no mouse sensitivity or fov slider, and some areas cause the screen to flicker when getting too close to the walls. There is also no save function because each case is timed. That's right. You only have a matter of minutes before you are prompted to choose a murderer. And then once you do, there is a good possibility that the game will crash. By my second crash, I was done with this awful experience. I would stay away from this mess and I most certainly cannot recommend it.",0

25044,"I would strongly discourage you from purchasing this game at full price of $20. The developer removed multiple routes for main characters, possibly just to save on time and rush this out the door for a hasty 1.0. Several storylines end abruptly with neither a clear resolution nor any indication they will be finished in the future. The developer is a poor communicator, to the point that many fans assumed the game was abandoned, and has missed multiple deadlines that he set for himself and announced to the community. Linda's ending feels rushed and out of character, a bad sign given she's the face of the game and the de facto main love interest. As the quality of the animations increase, the quality of the writing and pacing of the story decreases over the course of the game. At the very least it's not grindy.

Given the actions of this developer over the course of years being in his community, I fully believe this is a rush job to move on to the next cash cow and no further content updates will be coming, and I would encourage you to vote with your wallet and purchase any number of adult games with a track record of reliable updates, solid writing, and professional conduct on the part of the developers. If any of the deleted endings or cutoff storylines are polished and reintroduced with the quality some parts of the game have shown, I will be more than happy to change my review.

25048,"Decently executed RenPy incest-harem dating-sim-lite.  About 11 hours to complete it.
3rd party incest patch necessary for some of the relationships to make sense; plus 3rd party content restoration patch adds some scenes that have been removed for the Steam version.

[h1]The game isn't particularly original[/h1]

You've seen everything this game has to offer before, in varying degrees of quality.
[i]Filf[/i] has a near identical setup, but with fewer characters so it ends up with about half the content.  [i]My Cute Roommate[/i] has slightly more depth to the gameplay, but again - far less content.  [i]Lust Theory[/i] has prettier presentation, but is far more linear.

As with all of these titles, it doesn't really solve the fundamental problems games of this genre always have:  Superficial linear stories with the gals and very limited player agency; because letting the player create a narrative via their gameplay choices makes it too complicated to create a bespoke plot.

This game is very much middle-of-the-pack.  There's a decent amount of content, which means the stories don't feel as rushed and as inconsequential as in some titles; but it's still spread too thin and to superficially to be satisfying.  Everything still feels incomplete, anticlimactic, unsatisfying.

[h1]There's pretty much no player agency[/h1]

The grindy currency earning minigames are pointless and add no value to the product.  The things you spend your currency on are part of a linear story, so you don't get to do anything creative with them.  Even the obligatory ""go to the gym to become a chad"" elements are totally scripted and party of a VN route rather than part of a sandbox progression system.

What little interactivity there is basically consists of ""which gal's plotline do you feel like advancing to the next scene"" - which is better than nothing, but it's pretty bare bones.

What matters most in a VN is the player being able to engineer kinky scenarios with the best gals; to instigate relationship drama; and to enjoy the payoff you get from the results of this.
And so many VNs flub it because they don't understand why the clich√©s and tropes exist in the medium, so just include them ""because"".

[h1]The H-scenes are fine, but nothing special[/h1]

As is typical of similar products, they're all a bit by-the-numbers and sterile.  The attempts at introducing stakes ('oh, it's a dangerous day!' - doesn't matter, the game does precisely nothing with this dramatic tension) instantly dissolve because the game can't be bothered to spend time developing them further.

Part of this is the ""let's pretend the incest harem isn't an incest harem to avoid getting kicked off Patreon!"" issue, where devs think they're being clever disguising the setup as ""it's a landlady!"" - but end up having to omit all of the erotic and dramatic tension in the taboo to make the dialogue fit.
Part of it is probably not having any stand-out games to crib substantial ""epilogue"" gameplay off of; and not wanting to invest the time in interactive content that won't bulk up the playtime of people who don't make the decisions that trigger it.

It's a shame, as there is some high-kink plotting at work - but it's not really capitalised on effectively.

[h1]This game is just more of the same[/h1]

On the plus side, it's more complete than stuff like [i]MILFs of Sunville[/i] which want you to buy multiple chapters and keep you on the hook indefinitely without really coming up with the goods.

On the other hand, there's so many near identical games out there - and it doesn't matter if this one is marginally better or worse in any given respect, there's nothing stand-out or original in it.

If you know what you're getting into and are like ""Yeah, I could do with some more slice-of-life RenPy eroge"" - then yeah, this one's ""fine"".  It's tolerable, it's presentation and content is adequate.  It's mediocre but functional.

But if you expect something fresh, something novel, or even for the game to make good on any of the tropes and features that those games all fail to successfully deploy - well this game isn't going to do it.",0
25049,"As much as I want to like the game, there is a lot of missing content from previous versions. Some routes end abruptly when it seems to just be getting started and the money grind is just ridiculous. All the models and scenes look great, just wish this final edition had everything we had before with actual finished content",0
25050,"This game in definitively unfinished. If this game was outright bad I probably wouldn't right a review but the game advertises itself in the trailer and first few hours as being solid and finished but this is most definitely not the case. Animations are mildly smooth nothing like the trailer and the dialogue associated is so not it. A waste of game assets and money.

1. For a norp game the MC has a good model but he doesn't have a pin-able personality.

2. Choices seemingly do not matter. Most if not all are mostly left up to release your load there or there and when given an option the game somehow goofs that up. Ex.  You don't give a character your phone number and less than 3-5 in game mins later she gets it and starts sending nudes pissing off the current character your dating. 

3. Scenes are poorly written.

4. Bad resource management, you can easily get all the money you need by stealing it in convenient locations or just playing gambling games on your PC.

5. The game lacks a coherent identity, you don't have anything really to go off of except for the all too common ""college/family life"" .

6. No theme of progression, and a constant grind of going back and forth between settings, feels like chore. Other than the pretense of sex, I do not care to interact with the characters except for maybe Sara and Delilah.

7. Mini games that functionally do not exist. One in particular the pool mini game only gives you the illusion that it is a game. You race a character in a pool and no matter how fast you click you are going to lose regardless. No noticeable difference in 10.5 CPS and 2 CPS. So the game basically forces you to lose and go to the gym, which for whatever reason you are not allowed to go to the gym prior so you don't have to face a defeat. This repeats three times in a row.

8. Only two characters in the game have a unique personality that is actually likable that being Sara  and Delilah, to which the latter by the time you get to actually cracking open a good relationship with than the game drops her.

25051,"Up front, the game is not actually finished. You have about 90-95% of the content save for the Neighbor's story. That said the rest of the game is finished.

Next point that you must be aware of is the need for a 3rd party patch (The guides section of steam will point you in the right direction.) to be able to play the game as intended.

After those points what we have here is a solidly done Adult VN. It's not original or ground breaking but the visuals are well done and the writing is solid considering what these games usually have. I will say do not buy this game at full price, $20 for a game that still has unfinished content is too much. Wait for at least a 50% sale or better.",1

The scenes are decent considering the art style. The motion capture and animations are pleasing. I do not blame the dev for cutting corners to finish the project and move on. 
if it was sold at $10USD I might recommend it.",0
25053,"Here's what I'd say:

This is not as good as BaD... this is definitely a step down from that.

But this is better than Man of the House.

Basically, this game uses the sort of ""open world"" idea of Man of the House. But like Man of the House, it's just two stores, a college, and a few one-off locations. So, not much of an open world. However, unlike Man of the House and more like BaD, the locations all have multiple rooms to them (even the one offs), and there are cash and secret scenes to find in them.

The pace of this is far better than Man of the House, though. Where Man of the House had you repeat the same scenes (which were unskippable) over and over again to 'heart up' over 20 times or more, this has a far more sensible pace where  scenes are new each time and lead to 'hearting up' a few times after a bunch of unique scenes and events.

The college though... I mean, I wish this tried a different setting, because college has been used over and over, and games like BaD took the college setting and made a much more memorable story than this creates.

Worse, the mini-games are extremely simple compared to BaD. For BaD, there were word scrambles, logic puzzles, mazes, a ridiculously challenging reflexes-based volleyball mini-game, a more merciful tennis mini-game, and even a old-school Tetris-esque puzzle. And that's leaving out the pseudo-rhythem-based fighting mini-game in BaD. Meanwhile, this game has mini-games that are at least above Man of the House (where the mini-games were just pick three options and hope the RNG works out to get that pizza delivered). But what's here in this game is way less than BaD, as in this one, we have a literal rock-paper-scissors betting game, a couple versions of the same match-the-cards memory game, and a couple of incredibly simple one-offs (including a 'electrify the sex toy just right' game that looks more like one of the torture options Trevor had for that scene in GTA:V).

But it's in the story where this falls way, way flatter than BaD. 

Right away, there's not a lot of choice in dialogue. And of what's there, most has little meaning. Where BaD verged on being a RPG with its focus on some options locking out others, and having a pseudo Karma system that progressed as you made choices, this game has very little that seems to alter the story.

And the story... it's the 'land-lady' trope from Man of the House combined with a way less plausible version of BaD's 'professors and dean caught in a scandal' set up. This somehow borrowed elements from *both* games. I mean, kudos for understanding your source material, I guess, but the set-up is surreal in how much it borrows. Even the appearance of the dean of the college... it looks like the guy from BaD.

And it goes further, as the game directly breaks the fourth wall to discuss the creation of AVN games. It's bizarre how it lifts from other games' stories, then still breaks the fourth wall to have characters discuss stuff about making these types of games. In House Party, I can accept that the characters talk about being in a video-game because the entire tone is irreverent and zany in that game. But here, it's jarring because the game is grounded in reality a lot of the time... House Party gets away with it more because people fly in on hot-air balloons and distort the laws of physics.


At the end of the day, though, the game is decent for what it is. It's a step above Man of the House, in that the pacing of content is better and far less repetitive. People are pointing to chunks of the game that aren't fully rounded out, but at the same time, Man of the House also had areas t hat were empty 90% of the time, so having a mall under construction and an empty school pool (so far I have found no uses for either) isn't the worst of things.

For $14.00 (the current, release-week sale) I'd say it's a solid game. Animations are even marginally better than BaD at times (though very similar, there's just a slight bit more detail to the animations in this game). And the pace is better than Man of the House. 

But the story is definitely nowhere near BaD, the dialogue choices and number of meaningful decisions are light-years from BaD, and the open world itself is better than Man of the House by not by leaps and bounds. So go in with reasonable expectations, and it will be a decent game.",1
25054,"The ""final"" edition is far from final.  The story ends... maybe 1/3 of the way through, based on apparent progress with characters.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of consensus in the various discussion groups that this is SOP from the developer.  Long drawn dev cycle... early, promising releases, then a ""final"" that doesn't live up to the earlier pre-releases and dead ends.  For example, the neighbor has 3 short conversations and one long exposition.  BUT there's a backyard, doors, windows, and a ladder that mean nothing.  Apparently an earlier release made use of these, but that's been cut. 

There's ""equipment"" you can buy that does nothing.  Several  locations that have one scene, and then nothing. 

I support the dev on one of the patron sites.  The ""promised"" free access didn't happen till several days after the game was already on Steam.

25056,"Highly recommended! You'll not going to find such an adorable and understandable milfs and teen a like. The best part of this game is that it sexual scenes are closer to human sex meaning sex starting with talk then kisses then sex and in the end a hug or a kiss.

Also Final Edition is a major misnomer.",0
25059,"Oh boy, didn't think I'd see this game come out of development hell; but I'm glad to see it! Some things are changed from the demo/free version. It's a lot less rapey and, uh, more consensual, is the best way to describe it. Not that I'm complaining, consent is always important, after all.

Some things irked me, such as the mall still being under construction. Like, b*tch?! It's been under construction for how long now?! At least two years! Either finish it or quietly delete it from existence, you know what I mean?!

Other than that it's awesome so far, and I like the inclusion of the in-built guide. Very handy and saves you the trip of going to out-of-date guides on the internet. I do wish I could change the settings (or ""Preferences"" as the game calls it) from the title screen, as I had to deal with a less-than-full screen on startup until I started the game, paused, and then fixed it.

9/10, a little pricey but well worth it!",1
25060,"Pros:  Great animations, exciting scenes, Lots of beautiful girls with (in my opinion) great proportions, incest
Cons: Feels unfinished, visual novel (click simulator)?  incest, story

I recommend this game for the girls/animations alone.  The animations were pretty smooth and I didn't notice any clipping that similar games in this genre have.  Also about the genre, if you like visual novels then this won't be a con for you.  I added it as a con because there really isn't a lot to do but wander around and click things trying to advance character's stories.  There are a few mini-games to earn money, but aside that there isn't much to do.  

The story can be summed up by ""bang everyone"".  It mostly revolves around sneaking around behind other family member's backs while trying to bang your mom/siblings.  I put incest as a pro and a con because some might like it while others could be disgusted by it.  The good news is that you have to go out of your way to get an ""incest patch"" in order for the game to refer to them as family.  It's pretty obvious even without the patch who they are supposed to be though.

My biggest gripe (con) is that this game feels a bit unfinished.  There are a couple characters that you talk to that you feel like should have scenes, but don't.  Macy and Sidra.  Macy may have been intention (for some reason...), but Sidra has a house you can go to and explore, a kitchen that is locked (that never gets opened), and you can sneak to her back window (at night only).  You can't do anything with these though.  I'm not sure if it was cut content, or if I just missed out somehow.  I have the whole gallery unlocked (yes there is a gallery accessed through the computer in your room) and there aren't any missing scenes with Macy or Sidra.  Just a bit disappointing is all.

Overall I enjoyed this game for what it is.  You know what it is ;)

25061,"I played it before it came to Steam.
A lot of the main story was changed.

Still, not the worst game, but not worth the 14‚Ç¨",0
25062,"[h1]Teathless parody of the original story[/h1]
I don't know why, but this steam version of the story is so sterile and tasteless to the case where it's literally like an absurd. No family relations for main heroes, ok, I understand. But twins, really, now they're partners?)
Blackmailing now is just a role playing game, where the heroine trying to find a culprit with so much efforts even if she knows who he is, so it looks stupid, even after all those changes in the text to cover this stupidity.
Some of characters are even closing their story line before they even started, wtf!?
The game is so afraid of doing something ""illegal"" (as developers think?) that I can't even understand, why that was released in the steam. Yes, I played it more than 2 hours, because I was sure that they can not do this to me. I played a ""free"" version of this game and wanted to support developers with my money. There was a lot of content and events which are not included in the ""FINAL EDITION"".
Now I want my money back. And I will never support this crap and developers again. The original game is good, but this piece of crap is a total scam.

25063,"Overall this is a solid game.  Some of the story lines are well done and the writing is actually better than the average (rather low bar for VNs).  There is some jankiness with some story lines where it looks like older versions of a story are still in there and make no sense.

The minigames are stupid simple to the point I am not sure why they are there - but I figure it most of the VNs the minigames are more for the dev to learn more about programming than to actually entertain.

Animations/visuals are good.  The writing overall is great, but could really use one more heavy edit to remove abandoned story lines and inconsistencies.  Think that is the most infuriating part of the game - it really could be one of the best out there with a little more work, but I believe they are done working on this one so this is it.  Seems insane to not have achievements as well, since those little dopamine hits make so many people happy.

-Cindy has one scene that costs 1000$ in-game (which is absolutely absurd, given the tedious grind to make money)
-Same money problem for Caroline's friend.

25067,"Good: So this story is really rich with fun, lustful, mini-games, sandbox sex, and cool content. The main character is OK at times, but honestly he wastes way too much time on paragraphs of text before sex.  So on to the bad.

Bad: Animated scenes needed to have text over it, instead of breaking to pause the scenes during sex. It breaks the immersion, and the flash to white when popping your nut could have been replaced by a flash to the liquid exiting and then to where it lands when not cream filling. The choices you make do not amount to anything. I have cream filled so many women worrying about being pregnant, and not one has produced a child as of ending all the story lines. I have cheated and dated multiple women and none of them even know of each other. Then the girls who are of less importance you don't get to visit them and sandbox sex with them. I really liked breaking down Delilah's walls, and it just fell flat and nothing more. As much as this bad review is long, the game itself is actually good for what it was. Lots of stories to pursue, but not much paths to end up on.

Conclusion: All in all, it has many hours of story and lots of women to pursue.",1
25068,"I play out of duty to finish and not pleasure, this is my feelings toward this game. 

Do choices matter?  Regardless of choice I currently seem to end up doing the same thing regardless with slightly different wording.  Apparently not or not much or maybe at the very end. 

Writing:  the premise is ridiculous.   The writing itself is a lot better than other badly translated novels but I‚Äôm not really drawn in.  

Fun time:   Repeatable scenes.  Forced submissive and humiliation with a reversed ‚Äúdominance‚Äù that isn‚Äôt very satisfying.  The writer leans into fantasy vs a solid understanding of female anatomy, which isn‚Äôt always uncommon.  MILFs are apparently required to have watermelons for chests.  If you like feet you may really enjoy a number of scenes the game has to offer.  Way too many feet to start for me.  There is also cheating of sorts and the risk of getting caught fun.  

Game play:   Lots of clicking around the map in a way that feels grindy.  Exploration can open up new content but it really does wear after a while.  The cash generation is low unless you save scum rock paper scissors.  (The easiest method I think). It would have been nice to skip time without jumping out to the main map and to allow clicking the main map from anywhere.  So many extra unneeded clicks really wears after a while. 

The MC is an idiot.  The stupid was hard with some choices where I wanted to yell at the screen.  

If people have a milf and humilation fetish, they may like the game.  I‚Äôm not sure it does anything well, but I know hitting peoples fetish can really raise the appreciation for a game.  I don‚Äôt think the game will do much to scratch a domination itch, as it barely brushed mine. The fact the submission and humiliation was not avoidable if you wanted the content was annoying. 

So, you do you but this was definitely not for me and I grimly work through it without joy because I just want to get it completed and filed away.   I guess I lasted longer than an hour of play, so it‚Äôs definitely not the worst game, but definitely not for me.",0
25069,"I see a lot of reviews here complaining about game being cut short by the developer/being incomplete compared to what was promised on Patreon. And to be honest I don't think it really matters!

I've never seen the Patreon version of the game - I've decided to take a risk, buy this game on Steam and as a result - I had a lot of fun with it! The game is quite long (but thankfully due to scenes/erotic buildup and not due to boring dialogs!) and full of very nicely done ""action"". I've spend more than 20h on it to finish all the storylines from different characters. And there are many of those! I haven't noticed anything ""clearly removed"" from the game - maybe 2 characters (out of ~10) have very short storylines - and maybe there were some ideas to make them longer? I don't know - but what is there is in my opinion still very good.

The visuals are great - the developer for sure has a lot of talent and put a lot of effort there. The animations are also frequent and of a very high quality. I've never seen any ""disfigurations"", clipping or anything else that would show that any shortcuts/rushed work was done with them. The character stories are quite interesting, and the writing is pretty correct (no translation issues). Of course there is the obvious ""landlady/roommate"" workaround made to avoid incest which may break immersion a little - but there is a very short guide, also available on Steam, clearly explaining how to ""patch"" the game, to make the dialogs as originally intended.

There is free roam, there are minigames, there is even some grinding to earn money, which can be annoying sometimes - but there are also savegame editors available on the net, in case you really cannot stand playing another ""paper-rock-scissors"" or ""memory"" game, to earn additional cash.

Could the game be longer? Probably - there is still a lot of potential to make another season out of it, or add even more scenes - but what is there is in my opinion enough. I have to admit that the game actually started getting a little too long for me after those 20h, but I was still curious what other scenes I will see, and how the story/relations would evolve.

There are no different endings, (almost) all stories could be completed in a single playthrough - so the harem ending is there. I recall maybe 2-3 choices where you can cut the storyline short - those are the ones where the game tells you what is ""recommended"" - actually trying it the other way around could give you even more interesting scenes - so it's worth to at least save/try/reload. 

The main protagonist is not a moron/pig (at least not too much) so it's easy to sympathise with him, and there is a lot of funny dialogues/scenes.

In general - Milfy City is a very good game. One that (at least in my opinion) is of quality of Being a D*k or similar high quality AVNs. I strongly belive that this one is definitely worth trying. Have fun!",1

MAIN PROS
Amazing models and textures, decent story and not to much of a grind. Good mix of conquests and females of many flavours.  It's raunchy, sexy and well written, great animations... but not without a few pit falls!

MAIN CONS
Firstly there is no gallery to review previous conquests, secondly the end game is a little Meh! It lacks conclusion and leaves many story lines hanging... It just ends without actually concluding any of the many plot paths available.

PERSONAL NOTE
It's good but not great, could have been better with a gallery and repeated events... It just lacks a sense of achievement. With a better director it could have been amazing!",1
25071,"This is a decent game, but I can't recommend it for one reason that every story in it just ends abruptly.

Some of the characters are very interesting and while the main character is clearly a tool it is not a deal breaker. The sex scenes are good and the main develops relationships with each that are different enough.

But each time you finish with a character you get a message that this is all the content for that character at the moment. It feels like part of an incomplete project. None of the stories really have an effect on one another and the ending is just all the content is done but the game does not end.

A perfect example is that the main romances a stuck up sporty girl and we find that she wants affection but is pushed by her friends to act like a bitch. The whole thing just ends after we find that out. No change for her, just make out with her then oh well sucks that her going to be miserable. Then a message that this was all the content for that character. It feels like it was a half finished story.

The is no conclusion and no idea what happens to the main.",0

 You need a patch to get the proper experience, google it.

Im not into this kind of games, because mostly are straight forward ""action"" and thats boring for me. But this game has all the action in the world but the teasing is top notch, so without being realistic, the game tease you, gets you invested on the ""achievements"" and development of the relationships. It makes you wait, be patience, move around, fail, etc.

Things that could be better:

Character design, mostly all of them look the same. Without a few exceptions its like Kardashian City, i would like to see some age features on older women, petite ones, short ones, tall ones, etc. 

Some poses and dialogues are too over the top, like something no one would ever say or do outside some cheap porn movie (just moment, most of the game do the right thing)

The main character looks weird, specially when he smiles.

The animations and model textures are very good and I appreciate the artists making their own variations of face sculpts. These models proportions and bodies have been in so many games, but they do a god job making each look distinct. There are many non-vanilla scenarios and depictions of CNC roleplay, sleeping cnc, cheating, humiliation, footjobs, blackmail and violent sex. Sadly there isn't much warning or option to avoid those scenes, but the renpy a roll back and skip features can help you avoid things your not into. It is clear however which ladies are into that stuff, so you don;t have to repeat it. Also many scenes will give you a choice between a few types of sex, like if your not into anal or feet, there will be other options.

The art is okay, more cartoonish than true to life.  Some of the models used are overly familiar, maybe that's more on me for playing too many of these types of games.

   one other thing that bug me is im at the point in the story where i dont want to do what they want me to just to advance so i choose not to do it but it not realy a choice they lock progess until i have to do this stupid mission that realy make me feel like this type of story telling is not for me. 

    one day i will try to figure out how to do a visual novel of my own but i want it to realy be more fun with more well writing story and actually allow us to choose and persue who we want and have alot of interaction with them. i will learn so i can put something out it might not be better but it will be different. 
   this game is ok on the story.
the potential girls of no good beside the main cast.
writing is a hit or miss. some part they did good and then they did something bad enough that take away the good part.

i dont even know if i can find myself to fnish this game............ PLS  fix story progression beeing stuck on a chararacter you dont want nothing to do with my mouse is about to break from just clicking so fast to stkip the story of these force character i dont even want to see naked.",1

25094,"[b] Bestial Reception [/b] has the tag ""side scroller"" but that's not true. 
It is way more of a roguelite.

[h1] The following dissection of the game is a mixture of constructive feedback to the dev and a review for my fellow gamers [/h1]

You choose a character out of four, with the possibility of unlocking an additional two. 
The conditions of unlocking these extra characters are unclear though. (Note to dev: Maybe it should be mentioned somewhere)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028013988

Each character has a special ability it can trigger every 15 seconds or so, as well as a weapon specific for said character. 
This adds a welcome variety and unique possibilities for pairing between skills and weapons. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027983455

In the selection screen, the text is too crowded. 
To fix this: 1. Place each parameter on a separate line and 
2. Use images instead of words, e.g. a heart = health, etc., and standardize across the game (i.e. in the merchant screen)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028014464

When selecting a character, it's only the ENTER key that allows us to proceed. 
Add LMB as well as already done in other sections of the game, like here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028014880

There's no escape back to the main menu from the character selection screen. 
You are literally forced to either continue and start a new run or to ALT+TAB to force quit out of the game! 
This must be addressed. 

This roguelite offers a twist: 
Enemies drop artifacts hindering you one way or another. Pick them up and endure their passive effect till you reach the merchant and sell each for coins, which you then use to upgrade your rather skeletal arsenal. You may choose to ignore them and rely on your default weapon. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028015897

A neat trick is to leave the negative-effect artifact on the ground & only at the end of the level do you pick it up!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028016478

The color of this boss's health meter -and the health bar of your own character actually- is confusing. 
Maybe change it so that 'red' means full health and 'grey/black' means lost health. As it is, dark red for full health while bright red for lost health are just too ambiguous.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027983881

When the player is in the middle of a run and hits ESC, this is the menu that appears. 
It might be a good idea to add more information, like the default gun you start with, your health, current stats, etc. As it is, it's a bit too bare.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027984368

Typo: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028016023

The game features 10 very straightforward achievements, except maybe the two involving unlocking the extra two characters.

The achievements should have clearer wording:
It says, Kill 50/100/200 enemies.
It should say, Kill 50/100/200 enemies ""in a single run.""
I know because the 200 achievement didn't unlock for me although I killed over 150 in a single run before, so yeah!

Also there's a small typo in the achievement Thick - skinned 
It should be Thick-skinned
No spaces around the -
~~

I did have some fun with the gameplay and the sound effects cracked me up! Check the duck in the trailer lol

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
At the price tag of $2.99, the game isn't expensive by any stretch. Yet again, there are so many terrific master pieces (Tomb Raider 2013, Sleeping Dogs, Ryse: Son of Rome) that go on sale for exactly that same price. 

So I find myself recommending against purchasing the game at full price. 
In the game's current state, maybe for 66% off it would be a good deal. 
I hope the dev addresses these issues because the game does have solid potential.

25095,"""Bestial Reception"" delivered an electrifying gaming experience. Mastering survival as humanoid animals in a pixelated post-apocalyptic realm was captivating. Navigating intense battles, collecting loot, and unveiling secrets kept me engaged. The dynamic soundtrack added to the adrenaline rush. The game's uniqueness and challenges kept me hooked, making it a memorable adventure worth playing again.
GJ!",1
25096,"""The Crystal of the Cave"" is a gaming experience that has captivated me from the very start. As a gamer who appreciates the art of exploration and puzzle-solving, this game stands out as a beacon of creativity and challenge. The game's premise, centered around the mystical crystal within a vast and intricate cave system, offers a perfect setting for an adventure that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.

Navigating through the game's beautifully rendered caverns, I am constantly in awe of the attention to detail and the ambient lighting that brings the cave to life. The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring a blend of logic, strategy, and sometimes a dash of daring, which makes each discovery feel like a true achievement.

The story is another strong point, with well-written dialogue and a plot that unfolds at a pace that keeps me engaged without overwhelming me. The characters are memorable, and their interactions add depth to the gameplay, making me feel like a part of the cave's legend.

In conclusion, ""The Crystal of the Cave"" is an exceptional game that offers a rich and rewarding experience. It's a must-play for anyone who loves a good adventure and the satisfaction of solving puzzles that challenge the mind. I highly recommend it.",1
25097,"I recently purchased Bestial Reception on Steam and I want to share my rave review! This game exceeded all my expectations and became a real discovery.Graphics and visual design are simply amazing! Bright colors, detailed textures and perfectly detailed character models create a unique style and atmosphere of the game. Gameplay is dynamic and varied, constantly having to adapt to new situations and opponents.Combat is realized at the highest level: convenient control, many types of weapons and abilities, as well as the ability to combine them to create unique combinations. The variety of locations and levels is also impressive: from gloomy dungeons to picturesque forests and deserts.We would like to mention the music and sound effects. They perfectly complement the gameplay and create a unique atmosphere.In general, I am very satisfied with the purchase and recommend Bestial Reception to all fans of quality and exciting games. It is a great choice for those who want to spend time for an interesting and exciting gameplay.",1

25100,"A fun roguelike with pixel graphics, especially lively when played with a gamepad, great for killing time",1
25101,"You‚Äôll have fun for a couple of hours in this top-down shooter, but then you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs nothing new here.

You start by selecting one of six characters. Two of these must be unlocked, but the other four are available right away. One very strong character is unlocked by finishing the game once, but the other is a mystery since I don‚Äôt know how to unlock it. Because each character has a different primary weapon, artifact, and special ability, they all look and feel unique.

The objective is to kill enemies room after room until you reach the final stage. Each stage takes place in a single location. A teleporter that transports you to the next stage or the shop appears when the opponent counter reaches zero. You must pass through four distinct locations made up of a number of levels in order to complete the game. At the end of each location, a boss is waiting for you.

The only difference between locations is the color of the environment and the opposition. There are several of them, each with a unique attack pattern, but if you keep moving, most of them remain largely harmless. The only enemies that are bothersome are those that leave a toxic puddle behind after they die. 

The fun part about locations is that some parts can be destroyed with either bullets or something stronger like a dynamite. This has no use other than to give you more room to move around. But spawning in a new stage should‚Äôve been done better. Now you show up surrounded by enemies that swarm you as soon as you fire a single shot. This feels like a cheap way of punishing you.

All main weapons waste bullets that are found in chests around the stage. Although your primary weapons can kill anything, you have the option to purchase new ones at the store. This can be dangerous because it will reset the ammo you have accumulated for your current weapon. A huge downside is that you can carry only one weapons. If you pick up a new one, your current will be gone. This can quickly lead into disaster if you lose one of the best guns.

An artifact that will always have a negative effect may be dropped by some enemies. These should be collected because you can sell them for some coins. This enables you to purchase artifacts that have beneficial effects. The only thing you must remember is to pick up the artifact after buying it.  

The fact that some perks never disappear is another unpleasant side-effect of negative artifacts. I'm talking about artifacts that lower your overall health. You can end up with just one heart for the duration of the game because this doesn't reset even after you sell the nasty relic.",1

25105,"To put it simply, this one's... Weird. I had a super tiny amount left on an gift card and got curious and bored so decided to see how bad or decent this was. 

The map itself is very strange, the main island is a simple circuit with one station and a little city then it has this long odd line that goes in a pretty steep incline, then there's weird walls with random pictures and giant trees around the whole place. If you remove those outer tiles, walls, and trees plus the random pictures in the map it's alright but still doesn't feel quite right.

The trains are okay I guess? They're not bad but they have odd interiors and not very great sounds. The rolling stock is alright though.

Overall I'd say if you want to quickly get some soviet era trains and props go ahead but uhh yeah lol",0

25108,"An Awesome Virtual Driving Experience: DMVr

Rating: 4.5/5

DMVr is an impressively realistic car simulator that not only appeals to car enthusiasts but also offers an excellent tool for those who want to practice for their driver's license. With impressive graphics and detailed physics, this game creates an almost authentic driving experience.

Graphics: 5/5

The graphics are outstanding and take realism to a new level. From detailed interiors to realistic landscapes and weather conditions, DMVr offers a visual feast for gamers. The car models are incredibly detailed, and shadows and lighting effects contribute to a sense of authenticity.

Physics and Driving experience: 4.5/5

One of DMVr's strengths lies in its realistic physics engine. Cars react to road surfaces, braking, acceleration and torque in a way that few simulators can match. This makes it an excellent tool for practicing and improving real driving skills. However, there are some instances where the physics can feel exaggerated, which can be somewhat of a challenge for beginners.

Sound: 4/5

The sound in DMVr is generally good and adds to the realistic atmosphere. Engine sounds, tire screeching and ambient sounds are well designed and enhance the driving experience. Sometimes certain sounds can be played a little too loud, which can be annoying.

Learning curve: 4/5

For those using the game as a tool to practice for their driver's license, the learning curve can be somewhat steep. Despite a built-in training mode and tutorial, some parts can be challenging for beginners. More customizable and step-by-step practice modes could improve accessibility.



Conclusion:

DMVr is undoubtedly one of the most realistic car simulators on the market and offers a stunning visual and technical experience. For those who want to train for a driver's license or simply enjoy an authentic driving experience, this game is definitely worth considering. Despite a few minor flaws, the DMVr is an impressive achievement and a delight for car enthusiasts.",1

In the midst of facing the dual challenges of double cancer and the daunting Skulltrooper Disease, I discovered a game that not only provided a much-needed escape but also emerged as a vital source of strength and inspiration. DMVR isn't your ordinary video game; it's an immersive experience that not only transported me to captivating realms but also played a pivotal role in reshaping my perspective and resilience.

Right from the start, DMVR captivated me with its stunning visuals and dynamic gameplay. The diverse and imaginative worlds within the game served as a welcome distraction from the harsh realities of my medical journey. The game's storyline and vibrant environments created a unique and absorbing experience, allowing me to momentarily set aside the pain and uncertainty tied to my health struggles.

What sets DMVR apart is its ability to create a sense of adventure and exploration. The intricately designed landscapes, challenges, and quests within the game became a metaphorical journey, reflecting the battles I faced in real life. Navigating through the game's obstacles, I found parallels to my own struggles, fostering a profound sense of resilience and determination.

What astonished me most about DMVR was its impact on my mindset. The game didn't just offer an escape; it prompted a shift in perspective. Confronting challenges within the game encouraged me to approach real-life problems with newfound creativity and determination. DMVR became a catalyst for personal growth and resilience, proving that even in the face of double cancer and the formidable Skulltrooper Disease, triumph was possible.

In conclusion, DMVR transcends the typical gaming experience. It became a source of inspiration, strength, and unexpected connections during a challenging chapter of my life marked by double cancer and the daunting Skulltrooper Disease. Its captivating gameplay, immersive worlds, and unforeseen life lessons turned it into a transformative journey that continues to resonate with me long after the game is over.

25133,"Since many of you guys are confused about the prodedures and methods that involve touching grass, I decided to make this guide for you.

Step One: Locate an area of grass. The first step in touching grass is to find a place where grass is present. This can be a lawn in your backyard, a park, a sports field, or any other Slocation where grass is growing. Make sure you have access to the area and that it is safe for you to be there.

Step Two: Stand or kneel in a comfortable position. Once you have found an area of grass, stand or kneel in a comfortable position. If you are standing, make sure you have good balance and are able to maintain your balance while reaching out to touch the grass. If you are kneeling, place a cushion or towel under your knees for added comfort. 

Step Three: Extend your arm(s) in front of you, with your hand(s) open and fingers extended. This allows you to easily reach the grass and feel the texture and sensation of the blades.

Step Four: Slowly lower your hand(s) towards the grass. Take your time and move slowly to ensure that you don't accidentally step on or damage any of the grass.

Step Five: Allow your fingers to come into contact with the blades of grass. You may feel the softness and/or dampness of the grass depending on the environment. You may also feel the different temperatures of the grass if you are in a place with a different climate.

Step Six: Gently move your fingers through the blades of grass, feeling the texture and sensation of the grass. Take note of the different feelings and textures you experience.

Repeat step 6 as desired, moving your fingers through different sections of the grass to experience the variety of textures and sensations.

Step Seven: When you have finished touching the grass, stand or rise back to your original position. Take a moment to appreciate the experience and the sensation of the grass on your fingers.

Note: If you are allergic or have any medical condition that may affect you to touch the grass, it is recommended to consult with your physician before attempting this activity. Also, be aware of any rules or regulations regarding touching or being in the area of grass you have chosen.",1

25157,"As someone that actually enjoyed the base game despite some of its annoying tidbits, this DLC is pretty disappointing. 

Pros: 
- Annoying need to repair equipment every five seconds removed
- Equipment upgrades as a whole rather than individual items

Cons: 
- It's basically a stripped down version of the base game
- No more sponsor-ships
- Still no way to challenge contenders or challengers manually as a champion. 
- RPG event system is bare bones and at times glitchy. Caused my fighter to lose his title without even fighting
- Very little to actually buy outside of upgrades and temporary buffs that aren't worth it after you max out furniture. 
- Rivalry system and the ""personalities"" don't really matter as much as they should. Seems like you can get rival locked if you don't get a challenge from your rival and you move on divisions. 
- Support staff are there? But beyond maybe giving you a bit of extra fame and money (and the fact that you can't edit your support staff afterwards) they don't really feel important. 
- Manager skills are hidden and to be quite fair doesn't really feel like it mattered on which one you chose. 

As a boxer and fan of the base game, I was pretty excited to see there was going to be a solo career mode. Disappointed that this is essentially a very stripped down version of the base game.",0
25158,"As much as I was anticipating this dlc. It was kinda a let down but maybe that's my fault. The gameplay isnt transformative its your same basic game with some things taken away. Its still as much of a grind as the base game but at least you could have multiple boxers with different styles and fight strategies in the main game. The manager doesnt seem to matter much, the rivalries still arent relevant. Near the end you're just sitting on a stack of cash with nothing to really spend it on and im not even the world circuit champion yet. I hope they add something else to ease the time it takes to train since its just a solo career.",0
25159,"This DLC may be a bit buggy, I'm on day 250+ with max stats and STILL in minor circuit and unranked. Why? earlier in the game I got my scripted manager prompt and I saw all their stats and quirks were terrible. Let's say I declined them all thinking I'd get a reroll or at least the option to join them back in a week or so but. NOPE! Maxed stat swarmer with over 30 wins no loses in minor circuit and who only gets notifications about the top boxing managers AND random sponship deals that I can't even participate in and my fame is locked at 0.1 so basically this is a hard lock. At least so far but I've played nearly a year in game and nothing. I would've quit earlier but I just needed to display just how silly this is. Raptor Claw please fix or at the very least not allow you to decline managers like that. Game is still fun if you want to kick back and just watch weird looking dudes hit each other and make stock-esk sounds.",1
25160,Needs major tuning as far as getting injured after fights go. I will have fights go where the opponent never lands a hit on me and I clean up the round within 10seconds yet I leave the fight going from 85% to 30% with minor injuries. At this point I have to spend the next few days laying in  bed and before you know it im in debt and have to start my run over.,0
25161,Its fun if you liked the base game but dont want to manage multiple boxers.,1
25162,"A game of this quality and magnitude deserves support, especially when it is available literally for free.",1
25163,no nudity about this game. just few images. the girl is cute but just graphic. i will ask for a refund,0
25164,"Same as the previous game:
+ hot model
+ 10 scenes
+ eye contact
+ low price
- awkward animation
- pre-rendered low fps scenes
- short game",1
25165,"Don‚Äôt think I can trust this series. Game is simple, and the gallery that suppose to unlock after beating the game only shows a black screen with the options and audio. Contacted them but no response!",0

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Joy Life II is a Unity based memory matching game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
There are 10 puzzles. The number of cards varies from 6 to 20 cards, increasing every few levels. All of the cards start off face down so you have to find all of the cards.

The cards have a number in the upper left with a Roman numeral of how many objects are shown. I would have appreciated if the second card selected stayed visible a bit longer and if the Roman numeral correctly identified the number of objects, both 5 (V) and 6 (VI) show as VI. You only have a moment to see the second card. It would be better if both cards stayed flipped until the next selection was made or at least a few seconds.

Completing the level you unlock a story about Ovi. The stories are very poorly translated English. You to view a movie if you have the Free Steam DLC installed, otherwise you only get an image. If you don't select the Album option after completing the level you can view the unlocked content in the Album. You cannot view the images if you have the patch installed and you cannot view the movies if you don't have the patch installed.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
The Gallery is accessed using the Album option on the title screen. If you do not have the Free Steam DLC installed you will only be able to see the images. If you do have the Free Steam DLC installed you will only be able to see the movies. The movies have three camera icons in the upper right. Each camera is a different camera angle. The heart icon at the bottom of the icons finishes the scene.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A very quick memory match with images of a beautiful model as your reward (Movies if you have the FREE Steam DLC installed)

[h1]System Specs[/h1]
CPU: AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 9 7950X3D
Motherboard: Gigabyte X670E AORUS EXTREME (rev. 1x)

Cube rolling game in a cute, child-friendly presentation.

[b]What is it:[/b] A cube rolling game, you play as a cube trying to reach a target spot, but with a specific face. To make it more immersive, in the game you are a cute animal trapped in a jar, and to get out you need to place the lid face on top of the lid-removing tile.

The story: Koro and her siblings were playing nicely in the park when the mean witch Strawberry trapped all of them in jars. Can Koro the Cat escape and save her siblings?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300668247

The game is very cute, with well decorated environments with bright pastel colors, funny creatures and objects, plenty of animations and funny cutscenes. Ignoring the puzzles, this is perfect for a toddler, it reminded me of that Netflix show Buddi.

The puzzles are mostly easy too, but I think some of the levels get too hard for those that don‚Äôt excel at puzzle games. The game is split into 12 chapters of 10 levels each. Each chapter has 9 regular levels with only one cube rolling, and 1 special ‚Äúrescue‚Äù level in which you simultaneously roll two cubes. The first chapter is just about rolling, and the next five chapters introduce one mechanic each: paired teleporters, slippery ice, buttons and the obstacles they toggle, fragile lilypads, and rotating carousels. These first six chapters are manageable, since they have one mechanic (other than basic rolling), but then comes a chapter with harder levels with each mechanic, then more and more complicated chapters combining two or more mechanics. And the last level in the last chapter requires moving all 6 characters and finding a way for all of them to end up on their target tile at once! Definitely not a toddler level.

The game does a lot of things well. The presentation is great, for those that like cute things and very decorated environments. The ‚Äústory‚Äù keeps young players engaged. The levels are decent, easy but not boring.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3300668584

But a lot of things could be improved: undo, the level select, the long animations, the totally basic story, and slightly unresponsive controls. There is no undo, and it would really be useful, given that moving back to the previous state doesn‚Äôt work in levels with more than the basic rolling mechanism. The problem with the level select is that it's a 3-levels-deep structure. First you select the character to play with, then one of the worlds available to that character, then the actual level from that world. There is no easy way to just play the level you were at last time, when you restart the game you have to go there yourself. I would add a Continue button on the intro screen, separate from the Level Select button, and I would separate the character selection from the level selection. There are ‚Äúpretty‚Äù animations between levels, which is cute for kids, but I‚Äôm very impatient and I‚Äôd like to be able to skip them faster. It takes too long for the ‚Äúpress to skip‚Äù button to show up and work. For such a simple game, loading levels takes too long. It‚Äôs cute that there is a story, but it‚Äôs very nonsensical and poorly conveyed. After every chapter, the characters play a bit, as much as they can as blobs with no limbs, which is mostly jumping around, then zoom in on the witch, and everybody runs down. Colorful blobs moving on the screen is enough for toddlers, but this game isn‚Äôt for toddlers. Put a bit more effort into the story if you want to have one. Plus, controls are a bit finicky, there is no key repeat and no input caching, and with a thumbstick on a controller sometimes it does move as long as I keep it pressed, sometimes it stops after every move, and I don‚Äôt know why it behaves differently.

It might be a nice relaxing game for others, but personally I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it.

[b]How hard is it:[/b] Mostly easy, but with some moderate levels every now and then, and a challenging final level.

[b]How long is it:[/b] 120 levels, 3-6 hours, must be done in order, no skipping.

[b]Level design:[/b] OK, nothing surprising, but the levels aren‚Äôt boring either.

[b]Quality:[/b] Not bad, but could be improved. No undo. Selecting a level requires too many steps, and there‚Äôs no Continue on the start screen. Works with keyboard and controllers, but not configurable. A few audio and video settings. Cloud saving is supposed to be implemented, but it doesn‚Äôt work. Good progress achievements. It‚Äôs sluggish on an integrated GPU, and the controls and all the animations are slowing me down.

[b]Worth the price:[/b] If you‚Äôre not buying it to share with some children, wait for a discount.

[b]Most positive aspect for me:[/b] Good mechanics.

[b]Most negative aspect for me:[/b] No undo.

[b]What would make it better:[/b] Undo. Key repeat and input caching. Add support for multiple profiles. Add access to the settings from the pause menu. High resolution application icon. Fix cloud saving. Simplify the level selection. Key remapping. Graphics quality settings for slower systems. Improve the level loading time.

Played on Steam Deck.",1
25186,"I've been waiting for this for a long time, and i have to admit it did NOT disappoint, the levels are really fun and frustration at the same time, the art is so cute and easy on the eyes. 
it's addictive when i play it on my steam deck on the bed.",1
25187,"Fun & Simple puzzle game, music is nice & soothing but nothing amazing. Art style is very cute, the puzzles get progressively harder but not to the point of being annoying. pretty good for its price!",1
25188," love this game! its such a cute and enjoyable puzzle. the levels are a good mix of simple but tricky. would definitely find myself coming back to it whenever I'm on a break. some pointers however, I noticed whenever the camera zooms in mid cut scene the video becomes blurry and I am unable to see the details up close. also i am wondering if the game is optimized because my computer keeps running into some issues whenever I open it. other than that great work ( I wanna eat the level cubes :>... ) cant wait to unlock the next maps!",1
25189,"i love it! I have noticed that as the game progresses, each level has a fluctuating level of difficulty, making me relaxed for a few seconds but gets my gears moving, ready for what's to come. It's a fun puzzle game and may seem easy but it is not as relaxing as one might think due to the need to think the steps through. If you're up for the challenge, give it a try! I recommend it!",1
25190,I enjoyed this puzzle game. It has very interesting new ideas that can be challenging at times. The sound track is the icing on cake. Would recommend.,1

5.5/10 would recommend for a specific audience.",0
25193,"Real Fun puzzle game, that has a great balance of puzzle difficultly, It was simply just fun, kept me coming back again and again,",1
25194,Very fun and challenging game! Really requires you to think to solve a puzzle. Extremely satisfying when you beat a level that you‚Äôve been stuck on,1
25195,"At the beginning, I downloaded KERONEKO just to support the Arab game development team, as I usually do. However, as I progressed through the game, I realized it wasn't just a typical indie game with basic object collisions and reactions, as many first-time developers create. Instead, it is a well-polished game with a clean art direction.

The story is simple but serves its purpose effectively. The game design progresses smoothly, with new mechanics introduced at a good pace. I particularly enjoyed the final stage in each world, where you need to rescue your friends in double missions. Some puzzles, like unlocking a safe box lock based on correct movements and patterns, added an extra layer of challenge.

After finishing the game, I was delighted to find extra levels where you can play as different characters, which added significant value. This game shows great promise and could benefit from an unlimited run mode and a mobile port.

Great job, development team!",1
25196,"Great, cute and relaxing game! I especially loved the animation of the cat when sliding on ice. One question: Why is the sun so ANGRY?
Also (spoiler): [spoiler]that last level is EVIL[/spoiler]",1

25198,Art direction is adorable. The puzzles can be somewhat challenging the further you go in. Overall it is an easily accessible game that's good for calming the nerves and passing the time.,1
25199,"The perfect relaxing puzzle game!! The design and characters are super cute! And the game difficulty is not too easy that it's boring nor too difficult that I want to break my keyboard, it's just perfect. Each world has new modifications that also keep the game very entertaining. 10/10",1
25200,"The game‚Äôs stunning visuals and soothing soundtrack create an enchanting experience, he puzzles are cleverly designed, offering just the right balance of challenge and fun.",1
25201,the game is simple and that's a good thing i love the art and its simplicity the character design is cool and i love the music and how its compatible with each level so the game is simple and fine and fun!,1
25202,"Lovely little puzzle game, delivers exactly what it says in the description, calm and charming puzzle gameplay, with polished pastel graphics and cute sound effects.",1

The isometric puzzles start simple but cleverly twist, demanding strategic thinking. take your time and savor the adorable characters, each with a big personality. Even the villain, Strawberry the witch, is wickedly cute! With a relaxing soundtrack and a world begging to be saved, KoroNeko is a must-play for puzzle fans and anyone who needs a dose of delightful fun and I highly recommend it!

One thing I would like to suggest that it would be amazing if it has an optional timer to see how fast you can solve a puzzle (Leaderboard).

Please support our friend and the amazing director of the game, Ahmad<3",1

a couple of the puzzles are tough but over all it's fun and gratifying,

would recommend giving it a try especially with the low price tag.

BTW played it for the pink octopus, Khaboot is his name.",1
25216,"Love this game , make you think of how to solve puzzles in a new enjoyable way. Thumps UP.",1
25217,"Koro Neko (which translated means ""Cat""), is a puzzle game that features a bright, colorful world inhabited by anthropomorphic cats. The game's main objective involves solving puzzles through the manipulation of jelly jars and other objects within various levels. Players must roll these jars to specific locations, often navigating obstacles and utilizing various power-ups along the way.

One of the core gameplay mechanics in Koro Neko involves manipulating the game's physics to roll the jelly jars into the correct positions. This is accomplished through a combination of careful movement and strategic planning. Players must take into account factors such as momentum, angles, and the unique properties of various game elements to successfully complete each level.

In addition to rolling jelly jars, players will encounter a variety of other puzzle elements throughout the game. These include buttons that activate platforms, moving obstacles, and environmental hazards. Navigating these challenges requires a combination of reflexes, problem-solving, and timing.

The game's story is relatively simple, revolving around the hero cats' efforts to thwart the schemes of an antagonist named Strawberry. The narrative primarily serves as a backdrop for the puzzle-solving gameplay and does not heavily influence the moment-to-moment action.

One potential drawback of Koro Neko is its performance on older hardware or systems that do not utilize solid-state drives (SSDs). The game may experience slow loading times and occasional lag on these systems. Furthermore, the game's focus on cuteness and simplicity in both visuals and gameplay may not appeal to players who prefer more complex or realistic experiences.

In conclusion, Koro Neko is a puzzle game that offers a casual and colorful experience centered around rolling jelly jars and solving environmental challenges. Its emphasis on simple mechanics and whimsical aesthetics may appeal to fans of the genre or those seeking a laid-back gaming experience. However, its performance issues on older systems and potential lack of depth in gameplay and narrative may be a concern for some players.

25219,"so kawaiii and chill game!! and the puzzles are so good, not that type of puzzles that ruins your mood and i am totally here for em!",1
25220,"As someone who used to play Bloxorz, I got really excited when I heard about this game. 
And it lives up to the hype! I love the cute art style, the music is soothing, but nothing special. And the puzzles were awesome! 
As of this review, I reached 5-10 (I got softlocked on that level a lot!)
My only gripe is that World 5 can get you easily softlocked, that part was annoying (Then again, you could argue ""Skill Issue"")
I'd say the game is 100% worth it! 
It's great for Cozy gamers, and Puzzle Lovers alike! 
(Please add Workshop so that the game lives on!)",1

25223,"its a Great puzzle game , really Fun !! Good job!",1
25224,"KoroNeko is super cute, super cozy, and just challenging enough to make for good puzzles without building to rage-quit levels of frustration. We could spend hours enjoying this game in our leisure time and definitely recommend for those who want something to play and turn off their brains without really turning off their brains. Definitely give this game a try. You won't be disappointed.",1
25225,"cute puzzle game

+ nice art direction
+ very easy to pick up
+ new mechanics are introduced frequently to keep the the game fresh 
+ the game is relatively cheap and never overstays its welcome (it has nearly 100 puzzle but you can go through them fast)

-\+ even though the story is not an important element in the game, the direction in the cutscenes  needs a little work, it isn't clear whats happening or what the game is trying to tell you 

- with the huge number of puzzles I wish there's a way to skip a puzzle since you won't be able to try anything else unless you clear it. I can totally see someone getting stuck in a puzzle and never see the rest of the game.
- a hint system would be also nice for the same former reason
- the game NEEDS a restart button, you get stuck a lot in a map where you can't move anymore and you need to open the menu and restart manually from there, a dedicated button for restarting is a must.


Edit: thanks for adding a restart button!",1
25226,"This is a wonderfully crafted kids game that provides endless entertainment for the whole family. The vibrant graphics, simple and intuitive gameplay, delightful sounds, and positive themes make it a joy to play.

from credits you can tell it's an indie team, and pulling off with this Quality is very amazing :D! 

salute",1
25228,Adorable and beuatiful game. I loved it the art styis to cute. The puzzles got a little more complexes as the game progressed. Over all its something i can play when i want to relax and just slightly challenge my mind.,1
25229,"This game is mid

First of all the good things:
The game has more better models and shading compared to other Erogames, The H positions aren't that bad the best being the kissing positions, and there are options for bondage, femdom and basically fetish stuff. The audio quality is good and the game does feature customization which is good but limited, the backgrounds and areas are good looking with shading, lastly the music isn't bad at all.

Then the bad things
where can i start, firstly the price i think it's way too overpriced for the limited stuff it offers there are better alternatives like koikatsu which is made by the same studio formerly known as ILLUSION, other than the price the game offers too little content, other than sex there are no bonding between the characters just straight up sex, the game features too little dialogue where it ends up being too repetitive, the lack of customization options is a big issue as for the price of the game isn't worth it at all, my biggest issue so far is that there is no subtitles during H scenes and lack of story, the game also sometimes drops the frame-rate causing the game to lag.",0

25232,"The game is actually receiving content updates, but they are only available on the official website and only from Japan. You won‚Äôt be able to get updates without a VPN and google translate, because for some reason these updates are not available on Steam.",0
25233,"Basic impressions: 
Not a bad successor to KKP but if you already have KKP with mods installed and the like, this will not really stack up by comparison for quite some time. There are some features implemented in this game that I always thought would benefit KKP as well that were never added in a way that I'd consider user-friendly(Basically, making your own models/animations and crap in Studio mode while it runs at -10 FPS, with so many tools on the screen that you can barely see the ""Scene"" you're supposed to be working on...) But it severely lacks in the playability that makes KKP so enjoyable for casual play. It wasn't too long before I ""shelved"" it so I don't wind up resenting the purchase due to the time it takes for further developments, both official and not.

More details and potentially helpful info:
First off. like KKP, the game sold on Steam is a kind of watered down version of the end product and they offer a ""Premium Patch"" provided elsewhere for free that completes the base games content. Without the patch, the only thing the game will offer is an incomplete Character Creator and H Mode to initiate scenes. I played this version for about 20 hours and debated refunding cause it was very lacking. I felt like no matter what I did with my Sliders during Character Creation all the models come out looking roughly the same and the only thing I had a lot of creative freedom with is Hair Styles/Colors. Definitely don't skip the premium patch if you want at least a minimal amount of variety. If you have any problems getting it from the original source, you can also get it via the ""HFPatch"" Mods/Installer for this game just like on KKP. The ""HFPatch"" is obviously still in development kinda like the game itself sorta is so it's not gonna add 35GB's of polished content like on KKP but does add some basic animation tweaks(Including a really REALLY basic uncensor filter that is packed with glitches and awkwardness(Example: instead of male appendages ""Squishing"" after reaching a target point on the receiving model internally where it's not noticeable, it happens on the outside of the receiving model), menu changes and a handful of other plugins you can control the settings to via the in-game settings menu once it's all installed.

After installation of mods/patches and applying a full update, the game finally looks like it has potential(mostly due to Modders) but free roam still needs lots of work and is incredibly boring. The map is a sardine can consisting of a receptionist lobby and an atrium. It has a handful of rooms to enter(not counting the players room) which you can't really explore cause the doors are strictly there as a way to initiate ""Events"" within the rooms.

Interaction between characters has no depth to it either. The conversations you have will have basically no effect on their attitude towards you. the only way to alter any of their ""stats"" is through sex and once an attribute is maxed it can unlock new positions or alter interactions with those characters who have it maxed. For instance, once you max out ""Friendliness"" you unlock 3 new positions for Sex Scenes with that character and others who have it maxed, Once you max ""Obsessed"" it makes every interaction between that character and you end in a Sex Scene but it also keeps them from tiring out during scenes without using any of the items/settings you unlocked via the achievements and increases the odds they visit you in your room as you sleep.

Speaking of Sleep, it basically serves no purpose here. It can ""advance time"" which I put in Quotes cause there's no natural sense of Time to be found AFAIK. It's always the same time of day, day of the week, week of the month, month of the year, year of the century Etc...(Ad Infinitum) But ""Time"" advances at the end of any scene you initiate including peeping anyway. Whenever you initiate a sex scene or a peeping event, at the end of whatever scene you decide on first, you appear back in your room and it resets/shuffles all the characters and events on the map so free roam is basically pointless once you get through the little tutorial. Also, I don't know if it's the maps size that is to blame or what but the ""community"" consists of 5 individual Groups you can swap between, each Group has room for 20 cards but you can only ever have 1 Group active and by default, characters can't ""repeat"" across Groups unless you make duplicates in character creation. If you fill every available slot of your chosen Group then not all of them will spawn on the map at once, either so you're better off just keeping the arrangement at under 15 characters each(Literally the maximum amount of character models I have ever counted on the map at once, not including the ""Concierge"" at the front desk.)

Yeah, I'd say it has a long ways to go but Modders were pretty quick about making a basic HFPatch that was compatible so hopefully won't be too long now.",1
25234,"I would hesitantly say I recommend this game. It's a clear technical upgrade from Koikatsu, but that's about it. Before getting the HF Patch, there is damn near nothing in the game, like at all. Even after getting the patch, you still only get so much. 

I'd say get it, then get the HF Patch and just... wait for the mods to EVENTUALLY get added and give you new reasons to play. The devs clearly aren't going to make that easy, but this is internet. We're human, and we want horny game... it will take time, but we will get horny game to standard.",1

25236,"The game is good, but that doesn't really matter when you can't play it unless your location is set to Japan. I got the game before it was a problem so I might not even be able to get a refund. Trash developers who just want to scam you",0
25237,"While I do feel like this will be fantastic inevitably with more updates and modding most likely doing the heavy lifting, I cannot recommend this currently for its price as it feels rather unfinished compared to Koikatsu(KK) and Honeyselect2(HS). 
(There's gonna be a lot of comparing to KK and a bit of HS)

(starting out negative because I don't feel like rewording stuff)
Main gripes:
-While the models had such a GLOWUP compared to KK imo, theres currently not enough clothing/accessory's to make characters unique enough from each other, even compared to base game KK.
-This could be bugged or I am really bad at this game but when I'm going down on the girl (or when shes going down on you) her lust meter does not go up, only way I have made them climax is through spanking then penetration. While I wanna give props for realism of foreplay being important (lol), it's ONLY spanking that gets them ready. No fingering, massaging, oral, etc.

Additionally the lady can only cum when the dude is ready to go at the same time and I don't see why it couldn't be implemented to let them cum seperate from him like in KK or HS. Just a small detail but it feels out of place. (also its fucked up that you can leave the session without letting the girl cum once SHEESH)

-Only 6 personality types, not a letdown for me but the other 2 games had atleast 10+ (unsure about HS but there was definitely way more)

-Almost forgot the BIGGEST BLUNDER here is no community upload/download for characters, this was a backbone for KK why would they do this??


Things I like:
-New feature that was not in KK or HS is ""generate image"" where you can randomize or lock things from being randomized in character creation such as facial structure, body type, hair, chest, etc. 
I can see this coming handy in the future for making a model for art without wanting to go thru the effort of doing every little thing (a pain point I had with KK)

-Performance wise feels way better than the other two games, faster load times.
-Models got a glowup, abs look amazing
-Cleaner UI overall, KK felt like spaghetti compared to this
 
In short I am satisfied for now but the content is whelming/limited atm
If I think of anything else to add to this I will, according to other reviews and discussion posts you can get it for 20 bucks cheaper by going to their website if you really want it now before modding is in, I never saw KK or HS go on sale (on steam atleast) so now could be the best chance for a sale.


EDIT: Refunded on account of the game not working on top of my criticism's, also learned from other reviews that modding wouldn't be allowed (people WILL ignore this but this is still very ignorant from the publisher's pov).",0
25238,"Current Review Mar 4th, 2024: Game is now working again for steam users.

The Character creation in this game is the best I've ever seen in a game & is the reason I purchased it. The only down side I've found to it is that it Needs connection to the Developers Server & sometimes an update can leave you unable to connect to the server which results in the game being unplayable at those times.

I'd love to see more stuff from the developer in the future & I hope they continue to do an awesome job like they have been.

Old Review Mar 3rd, 2024: Game is currently Broken as of FEB 27th, 2024. The Developer at this time doesn't appear to have responded or resolved the issue.
  - If you purchase this game & are not a resident of Japan you will get the error message: ""Failed to obtain Version Information"" ""Server Connection Failed"".

From what I've been able to locate online other players have found other ways to play but both require the use of 3rd party tools which is not an option for me at this time.

If there are any other players who are running into this Error we should fill out the Report Game for being Broken as there is currently no warning from Steam about this game not being available for our Regions.

I'll Update this Review once the Current issue is resolved officially.",1

There is no real free roaming, unless you count strolling around the lobby as free roaming.

As for customisation items, barely any to speak of.

This price is so far over reasonable, spend it elsewhere, absolutely not worth it. Buy P*rnHub Premium or something, it'll satisfy more than this ""game"" ever could.

25246,"I give this game a Thumbs-Up with a caveat.  When fully updated and patched, the game is good and what we would expect from this sort of game.  The lack of clothing options limits the character creation, but it is still detailed and you can create many different characters with a little time and imagination.  With the inclusion of the Card Upload/Download option, you can share your cards and download one that others created.  There are other ways to share and some people are very creative. The gameplay is familiar and the story is thin, but the game is not trying to be different. It's a Hentai game, after all.  If you like this type of game, it is a good option as it is  being supported by the publisher and will at least have updates through the New Year
",1
25247,"I sort of wish there was a 'middle/maybe wait' option, since that would align more to where I am, but thumbs up gets close enough. 

Basically, this release is a pretty bare-bones; there's not many personalities for the girls, only a few outfits, and the main mode is a mostly straightforward sandbox. For all those reasons, the price of the game is pretty wince inducing, and the big problem in my eyes is the lack of a Studio Mode (like in Koikatsu) which would have done a lot to alleviate some of the problems. 

However, I do think there is a solid core to the game. The animations are great and varied, and while simple the sandbox does offer some options. And graphics and character model quality is actually pretty top-tier; Koikatsu worked for what it was, but I think there's been a real step up in terms of how everything looks. Likewise, I think there's some real good QOL improvements, such as a greater degree of customisation for clothes patterns/prints, and more 'layering' to character creation (such as being able to change make up and hair for different scenarios, which wasn't possible in previous releases (I think)).

SO, I think there's a really good foundation here. If they build off it (please, please release a Studio mode) I think it could be a really great product overall, though I won't deny they may have jumped the gun releasing it so feature-light.",1

Not very much accesories and cloths - again, I understand.

25269,The game is just alright. 70 dollars is more like a donation to Illusion from a fan.,1
25270,"Guess I'll start the review with some pros and cons:
(mostly compare to Illusion games since they are ""much alike"".)
pro:

	1.Better modeling has been implemented.(Especially Skindentation,oof)
	2.It seems like there are more detail customizations,some new accessories,and a few more motion sets.
	3.The game seems to have undergone some refactoring that makes it feel more optimized than its predecessors.

con:

	1.There are apparently fewer clothing options available at the moment.
	2.Exploring the game in the current version feels more like an interactive menu than actual exploration due to the lack of scenarios.
	3.Subtitles are still absent during H scenes.(Still)

Overall Rate:
	7/10---for those haven't played old Illusion titles
	6/10---if you played and had said games

Some personal thoughts:
	I don't really consider myself as one of the core audience of the genre since I didn't spend that much time on the old Illusion series,let alone experimented with some 	more complex mechanisms like modding and workshops.(though I've collect all products that're on Steam)
	But when I heard Illusion's closure announcement,I did feel...troubling,bit upset by the fact that there might not be these kinda game in a while to expect what's new.
	So part of the reason that I bought this game is simply as a gesture of good faith,and it's good to see the developers are still updating and maintaining the game.
	I do value the amount of work that needed to develop a project like this(simulator-kind) than some smaller H-games,so I'm willing to pay a price that is commensurate 	with the quality and quantity of the content.
	
With all that being said,here are some rather personal issues I wanna mention:

25279,"Unrestricted Pest Control, with its impressive design and seamless mechanics, has captivated me. In the mission to eradicate bugs in a nuclear research facility, the game provides a fantastic balance with its rogue-lite elements, creating an exciting atmosphere.",1
25280,"UPC, solo dev bir dev. tarafƒ±ndan geli≈ütirilen (bana s√∂ylendiƒüi kadarƒ±yla) ve tarafƒ±ma k√ºrat√∂r√ºm aracƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ± ile ula≈üƒ±lmasƒ± sonucunda ≈üans verdiƒüim bir yapƒ±m. Bitirmedim ve bitireceƒüimi zannetmiyorum ama ilk izlenimlerimi aktarmak yine de istiyorum zira √ßoƒüu oyunda iyi bir ilk izlenim bƒ±rakamayan oyunlar oyunda tutabildiƒüi oyuncu sayƒ±sƒ±nƒ± drastik olarak kaybediyor.

Oyunda toplamda 5 b√∂lge var ve her biri 10 odadan olu≈üuyor. Maƒüaza sayfasƒ±ndaki g√∂rsellerden ise odalarƒ±n yakla≈üƒ±k 30 saniye civarƒ±nda temizlenebildiƒüini g√∂zlemledim. Basit bir matematikle de her bir run'ƒ±n 15-20 dakika civarƒ±nda sonu√ßlanacaƒüƒ±nƒ± ve en k√∂t√º 1 saat i√ßerisinde oyunu bitirebileceƒüimi tahmin ettim. Aklƒ±ma getirmediƒüim ≈üey ise skill ceiling/learning curve oldu ki aslƒ±nda bu tarz oyunlar ilk elinize aldƒ±ƒüƒ±nda i√ßine hƒ±zlƒ± dahil olduƒüunuz ve kolay adapte olduƒüunuz ancak ilerledik√ße canƒ±nƒ±za okuyan yapƒ±mlar olur genelde. UPC de biraz √∂yle. Bunu akƒ±l etmemek benim enayiliƒüim elbet. Bu tarz oyunlarƒ± aslƒ±nda iyi kƒ±lan bel kemiƒüini unutmu≈ü bulundum. Bunu demekle beraber bu tarz oyunlarƒ±n matematiƒüi √∂nemli. G√ºn√ºn sonunda i≈ü input-output'a kadar indirgenebilir. Reductionist bir tavƒ±r ne i≈üimize yarar derseniz de onun cevabƒ±nƒ± benden ziyade √ßok iyi bir QA ekibi vermelidir zira oyunun dengeli ve adil hissettirmesi oyuncunun yeteneƒüi kadar oyunun matematiƒüine de bakar ve ince elenip sƒ±kƒ± dokunmasƒ± gereken bir i≈ütir bu.

UPC hakkƒ±nda en b√ºy√ºk sinirim ve hayal kƒ±rƒ±klƒ±ƒüƒ±m ise oyunun kafasƒ±nƒ±n biraz karƒ±≈üƒ±k olduƒüunu d√º≈ü√ºnmem (evet burada mecazƒ±m√ºrsel var :)) Oyun rogue-lite elementleri barƒ±ndƒ±rƒ±yor olarak pazarlanƒ±yor ama ben bunun doƒüruluƒüunu savunmuyorum. Bug√ºn oyunlarƒ± keskin kalƒ±plara sƒ±ƒüdƒ±ramadƒ±ƒüƒ±mƒ±zƒ±n farkƒ±ndayƒ±m ancak Twitter'dan tutun buradaki incelemelere kadar T√ºrk oyuncu topluluƒüunun janrlarƒ± bu kadar yoruma a√ßmasƒ± ve muƒülakla≈ütƒ±rmasƒ± epeydir garibime gidiyor. Zira bir ≈üeyi sƒ±fatlandƒ±rmak i√ßin o sƒ±fatƒ± andƒ±racak √∂zelliklere/indikat√∂rlere sahip olmasƒ±nƒ± bekleriz. UPC zaten roguelite bir oyun deƒüil, ba≈ütan s√∂yleyeyim bunu, tartƒ±≈ümaya a√ßƒ±k bile deƒüil. ƒ∞ki run arasƒ± bir ≈üey ta≈üƒ±yamƒ±yorsunuz ancak roguelike da deƒüil. Bug√ºn roguelike her ne kadar eskisi gibi rpg'nin bir alt tabanƒ± olmasa da (ADOM vs.) roguelike oyunlarda genelde procgen tasarƒ±m √∂ne √ßƒ±kar. B√∂lge bosslarƒ± tasarƒ±mcƒ± vizyonunun inisiyatifine baƒülƒ± olarak deƒüi≈ümeyebilir ama sub-regionlar minimal d√ºzeyde olsa da d√º≈üman dizilimi, barƒ±ndƒ±rdƒ±ƒüƒ± potansiyel pickuplar ve/veya haritanƒ±n dizaynƒ± olarak pekala deƒüi≈üir. UPC'de b√∂yle bir durum da yok. UPC √∂z√ºnde bir top-down arena shooter. Ancak iddia edilen rogue-lite elementleri bulamamam benim su√ßum mu inanƒ±n bilmiyorum √ß√ºnk√º oyunun oynanƒ±≈ü d√∂ng√ºs√º ve size ge√ßirdiƒüi 'game sense' o noktada ciddi patlƒ±yor.

Bunun T√ºrk√ße meali ne diyecek olursanƒ±z: √ñncelikle UPC'de √ßok takdir ettiƒüim bir √∂zellik olduƒüundan bahsedeyim. Sadece yatay ge√ßi≈ü deƒüil dikey ge√ßi≈ü de var. Yani 0-1'den 0-2'ye ilerlemek doƒüal bir ilerleyi≈ü a√ßƒ±sƒ±ndan makul bir rota √ßizerken daha fazla d√º≈üman √∂ld√ºrmeniz sonucunda 1-1'e atlayabiliyorsunuz -i≈üinize gelirse tabii- ve direkt daha zorlu bir rotayƒ± tercih etme inisiyatifini elinize alabiliyorsunuz. Bu kaƒüƒ±t √ºst√ºnde √ßok g√ºzel olmakla beraber ciddi hassas ayar gerektiren ve Returnal gibi b√ºy√ºk skalada bir oyunda bile ciddi sorun yaratan bir tasarƒ±m. Ki Returnal takdir edersiniz ki b√∂l√ºm tasarƒ±mƒ±nƒ±n getirisi sonucu haritayƒ± saƒülam traverse etmek i√ßin tanƒ±manƒ±z gereken ve iyi de bir tepki s√ºresi gerektiren bir yapƒ±m. UPC elbette doƒüasƒ± gereƒüi o kadar derinle≈üemiyor ama en azƒ±ndan fikir olarak iyi. Peki sadece o kadar mƒ±? Hayƒ±r. Geriye de d√∂nebiliyorsunuz. ƒ∞≈üte o noktada benim kafa daƒüƒ±lƒ±yor. Bana yeni bir deƒüi≈üken sunuluyor ve bunu i≈üleyemiyorum kafamda. Neden bunu yapmalƒ±yƒ±m? Halen bir cevabƒ±m yok. Oyunda size avantaj saƒülayacak √∂zellikleri belirli bir xp e≈üiƒüini atlamanƒ±z sonucunda elde ediyorsunuz (Brotato'ya en yakƒ±nla≈ütƒ±ƒüƒ± dizayn tercihlerinden birisi olaraktan) bu da akla bir soru getiriyor. Acaba power grind mevcut mu ve yapmalƒ± mƒ±yƒ±m? Denemedim ve d√ºr√ºst olayƒ±m denemek gibi bir niyetim de yok ama bu m√ºmk√ºnse bile iyi bir dizayn tercihi olduƒüunu s√∂yleyemem. Bu oyun dalga dalga d√º≈ümanlardan kurtulmak hakkƒ±nda deƒüil belirli d√º≈üman sayƒ±sƒ±nƒ± √∂ld√ºrerek ilerlemek hakkƒ±nda yani eski kafa Nuclear Throne gibi roguelike yapƒ±mlara daha √ßok g√∂z kƒ±rpƒ±yor. O noktada oyuncunun yeteneƒüi force leveling t√ºrevi her ≈üeye ciddi fark atmak zorunda. Eƒüer durum buysa da neden geriye d√∂nmemize izin veriliyor bilmiyorum. Onun haricinde neden her odanƒ±n kendisine ait bir zaman ve √∂ld√ºrme (rekoru) sayacƒ± var onu da anlamƒ±yorum. Oyunda bir leaderboard yok ve her oyunu teknik olarak speedrunlayabilsen de pratikte UPC'nin buna √ßok hizmet ettiƒüini d√º≈ü√ºnm√ºyorum. Hud'da kalabalƒ±k olarak g√∂r√ºyorum. Bunlarƒ± s√∂ylemekle beraber oyun boyunca g√∂z√ºn√ºz√º √ßoƒüunlukla merkeze sabitlemenize ya da g√∂rece sola kaydƒ±rmanƒ±za raƒümen t√ºm belirte√ßlerin sol √ºstte yer almasƒ± (evet, klasik bir UI tasarƒ±m tercihidir) biraz talihsiz. Bahsettiƒüim oyunlarla ha≈üƒ±r ne≈üir olanlar varsa ≈üimdi 'Ulan lavuk verdiƒüin √∂rneklerde de √∂yle deƒüil mi' diyeceklerdir. √ñyleler ama efendim k√º√ß√ºk n√ºanslar devreye giriyor i≈üte. Yatay bir HP barƒ± herhalde insanlƒ±ƒüƒ±n en ba≈üƒ±na kadar uzanƒ±yor. O konuda tek sakƒ±nca zannƒ±mca UPC'deki gibi nispeten uzun olmasƒ± oluyor. Benim tercihim bu y√∂nde olmazdƒ±. Onun haricinde Nuclear Throne'da da her zaman damage yediƒüinizi aksiyonu yoƒüun bir sekansta anlamamanƒ±z m√ºmk√ºn ancak bir saniyeliƒüine de olsa HP barƒ±nƒ±n yanƒ±nda LOW HP uyarƒ±sƒ± beliriyor. Brotato'da da sol √ºstte bir bar olduƒüu kadar hit yediƒüinizde karakterin √ºst√ºnde beliren bir can barƒ± ve yediƒüiniz hasarƒ± belirten n√ºmerik bir belirte√ß de ortaya √ßƒ±kƒ±yor. ƒ∞≈üte bunlar UPC'de eksik olduƒüundan √∂t√ºr√º sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ±ya d√º≈üt√ºƒü√ºm √ßok oldu. Diablo'nun Barbarian'ƒ±nƒ± andƒ±ran bir skill a√ßƒ±p deli danalar gibi d√∂nmeye ba≈üladƒ±ƒüƒ±mda (g√∂r√ºn√º≈üe bakƒ±lƒ±rsa b√∂ceklerin size dokunmasƒ±nƒ± engelliyor ama onlarƒ±n ate≈ü ettiƒüi damage'ƒ± nullify etmiyor. O da ilgin√ß bir tercih) bir anda kendimi √∂l√º buldum. 

Can tamlamanƒ±n bu tarz oyunlarda geleneksel olarak pickup yanlƒ± deƒüil de level atlama sonrasƒ± se√ßime baƒüƒ±mlƒ± olmasƒ±nƒ± garipsedim. ≈ûans devreye giriyor ve 2 se√ßimin de i≈üinize yaramayacaƒüƒ± bir konfig√ºrasyonda can tamlama √ßƒ±kabiliyor. Bu da se√ßiminizi komple i≈ülevsiz kƒ±lƒ±yor. 

Bir diƒüer kafa karƒ±≈üƒ±klƒ±ƒüƒ±m ise muhtemelen a√ßƒ±klamasƒ± en zor olanƒ± ve burada benim de b√ºy√ºk bir yanƒ±lgƒ±m olabilir ancak UPC'de size toggle on-off bir se√ßenek sunuluyor: Dual analog. En amiyane tabiriyle UPC nezdinde ≈üu demek oluyor: Eƒüer kaparsanƒ±z karakterinizi 360 derece d√∂nd√ºrmek adƒ±na simultane olarak WASD kombinasyonunu girmeniz gerekiyor. ƒ∞kinci aygƒ±t (mouse) devre dƒ±≈üƒ± kalƒ±yor ve sizde √ßoƒüunlukla sadece x,y,z kordinasyonlarƒ±nda 'strafe' yaparak ate≈ü edebiliyorsunuz. Hatta teknik olarak o bile √ßok m√ºmk√ºn olmuyor zira s√ºrekli oryantasyonunuz bozuluyor ve tekrar hizalamak da bir hayli zor. Bu da taa N64'de bƒ±rakƒ±lan Turok, Golden Eye 007 gibi bir oynanƒ±≈ü ortaya s√ºr√ºyor. Sƒ±rf merakƒ±mdan developer'ƒ±n √∂n√ºne d√º≈üerse bu soruma cevap arƒ±yorum: Neden bunu gerekli g√∂rd√ºn√ºz? Oyunun akƒ±≈üƒ±nƒ± 180 derece deƒüi≈ütirdiƒüi gibi dual analog modern oynanƒ±≈üa yapƒ±lmƒ±≈ü en b√ºy√ºk iyiliktir herhalde. Elbette her oyun dual analog kullanmak zorunda deƒüil ancak oyunu onun etrafƒ±nda kurgulayabilmek √∂nemli bu da benim g√∂rd√ºƒü√ºm kadarƒ±yla genelde Bmu, side scroller t√ºrevi oyunlarda m√ºmk√ºn oluyor √ßoƒüunlukla. Diƒüer t√ºrl√º anlamsƒ±z kƒ±lƒ±nan bir se√ßeneƒüe d√∂n√º≈ü√ºyor. Oyuna bir ≈üey eklemediƒüi gibi aksine g√∂t√ºr√ºyor. Ciddi bir zorluk dalgalanmasƒ± olu≈üturuyor. Analog se√ßeneƒüinin yanƒ±nda auto-shoot opsiyonumuz da var ki o da tartƒ±≈ümaya a√ßƒ±labilir ama ben eri≈üilebilirlik ayarƒ±dƒ±r deyip ge√ßiyorum. ƒ∞lk seviyelerde sabit durup ate≈ü etmek daha bir m√ºmk√ºn olduƒüundan dual stick zorunlu deƒüildir demi≈ütim de... ƒ∞≈üler sonradan epey deƒüi≈üiyormu≈ü.

T√ºrkiye'den iyi bir topdown shooter √ßƒ±kmasƒ± i√ßin canƒ±mƒ± veririm. Action roguelite, twin stick shooter. Hi√ß fark etmez. Ama oraya biraz daha var gibi. Bazƒ± fikirler tekrardan ele alƒ±nƒ±r ve r√∂tu≈ülanƒ±rsa √ßƒ±kacaƒüƒ±na da inancƒ±m tam.",1

25292,"I find myself having difficulty picking favorites.  I can listen to this thing front to back with no skips.  I'm gonna start listening to this while playing racing games too.  Another banger project from Savant, who has a strange ability not to disappoint me over an entire decade's worth of music.",1
25293,"It's actually mindblowing how well produced this set is, every song has a unique identity and there were a lot of real surprises.     I really enjoyed the first game, and each track fits perfectly with it while being more than enjoyable on their own. Also I'm all here for Seven Seas like what even tf you madman.",1

Thank you for delivering another amazing trip, already giving me goosebumps with the first 2 tracks I'm listening while writing this. Keep up your insane work Aleks <3

Edit 2: That Jet Set Radio vocal in Ambrosia made me shiver so good",1

25298,"As someone who has listened to every single Savant album and loved them all, this is a must buy! Every single song is a banger and I'm gonna enjoy every minute of this!",1
25299,"One of the best soundtracks I have heard in quite some time. The mastering, melodies, orchestral merged with today's music, into 4 albums. Absolutely in love with every single song in this OST and album!!

It's over 2 hours of music, but I would play the whole album again and again, like Krang and Mortals. Giving out new and old songs from years ago to releasing it, very lovely to hear the melodies that Savant had years ago and hasn't been discarded. Basically, these albums are a combination of Orakel, VOID, Vario, Alchemist, and some Outcasts vibes which is just amazing to hear!

It was so fun seeing and competing with people with the highscores in the demo, and I loved participating on it!

Been a fan for over 10 years, and it's amazing to where Savant is at right now where he's achieving dreams and progressing so rapidly, having a complete remake of Ascent, which many people including me were hoping for many years and it finally happened. I congratulate Savant and the D-Pad team for a phenomenal job on both music, effects, and game!",1

25306,The hours of grinding for a top score during the demo competition were 100% worth it.,1
25307,Kinda a dope fucking Album if I do say so myself. And I'm not just talking the EDM stuff. Metal version of ascent was pretty spicy.,1

Looking forward to the game too.",1

Great OST, artwork and character design.

Thank you for the experience.",1

Made me really excited for the upcoming game! <3",1
25312,"To quote Ambrosia as to how this is a banger of a soundtrack ""You make me feel so good~"" 10/10",1
25313,"Elevator instantly made this one of his best albums ever. I can easily tell how much work he put into this. Elevator, Felix, Spinnacle, Castlerock and Vario World are my top 5 for this masterpiece. The fact that an OST is on the same level with the rest of his work blows me away. At first I was confused at the Steam Exclusive announcement, but I'm glad because this was worth the money. 10/10.",1
25314,"One of the soundtracks of all time. Do not be put off by the Steam exclusivity, as this is a triumphant culmination of the many flavours of Savant.

Only thing I'm missing is a vocal-driven banger, though perhaps there wasn't an appropriate place for one in the soundtrack of this game. 

Overall, this excites me for the release.",1
25315,I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant I love Savant,1
25316,I discovered Savant I'm highschool. No musician has EVER compared to this genuis. I am absolutely NEVER disappointed with his releases. Seriously phenomenal album man my GOD! I thank the stars I've been able to keep up with his work it's all fantastic,1
25317,"I've been a fan of Savant for a long time, ever since the release of the original Alchemist album back in 2012. This is yet another masterpiece just like the rest and features a great variety of styles and genres. I'm super excited for the game, but this is bound to keep me satiated until then.",1
25318,Awesome work of music. Savant is making the best musics for years,1
25319,"Had my head boppin the whole time, cant wait to play some classic platform shooter with it!",1

doesn't thing album will be on his bandcamp so buyed it here.
i mostly like Ozymandias.

25333,"If you like Trains. If you like managing things. Then this really is the game for you! 
Train Traffic Manager is such a pleasant game to play. Everything about it feels how it should be.
It was already fun to play the game on the Nintendo Switch. So I'm very happy it came to Steam as well.
Now I'm waiting for Cooking Arena to also be announced for Steam. That's also made by Baltoro Games.
I hope you'll enjoy Train Traffic Manager just as much as I do.",1
25334,"Train Traffic Manager is a relaxing and exciting game at the same time. The graphics are fantastic to look at with very pleasant colors, great art design and entertaining animations. The music and sound effects are good and fit the game well.  Now and then you'll get a hard level and you'll have to put in more attempts to be able to clear it for three stars. It's all based on logic. So the more attempts you play on a level the clearer it becomes what you have to do to solve it. You have to put some thought in. So the challenges you get are entertaining. And that's what makes it exciting to play. Because when you crash the trains, you'll laugh about it since it's your own fault. And it makes you say let's try again. Also because the graphics are keeping you entertained a lot. I highly recommend it!",1
25335,yes,1
25336,"So This game is genius and great and no need to explain, if the devs see this review then they shall know that i didnt find a time thingy clock ingame and if there isnt then i hope there will be one in the full game.",1
25337,"Technocide happens to be one of the most original STG designs I've come across in quite sometime.  It's very non-traditional in its configuration as a non-linear and choice driven STG.  Slight roguelike features such as random planet/mission choice and random purchasable shop items make each playthrough feel fresh as does its core gameplay loop of ever increasing difficulty.  The weapon/overkill system and how kills are scored/tallied is superbly designed as well IMO as is the players #1 priority to protect the mothership from enemies exiting the screen. There is not another STG like this that I know of.  This is a real hidden gem.

P.S> If there is anything that should be added its online leaderboards for expert mode. The game deserves it.

EDIT: Also wanted to mention that the BGM is superb as well!",1
25338,"Completed a run on normal difficulty, will give expert a shot soon. 

Pros:
- Punchy weapons, overall brilliant gamefeel
- Really nailed the nostalgic artstyle of early 00s(ish) homegrown games
- Chain scoring and other shmup mechanics add depth and are presented in a beginner friendly way

Cons:
- OST has a few weaker tracks that are used during the first few levels

An easy recommend for fans of shmups like Raptor and Jets 'n' Guns",1
25339,"Reminds me of a legendary DemonStar, but plays very differently. Has some interesting twists in mechanics that work really well like that the objective is to protect your base ship by not lettings enemies through instead of trying to survive and thinking when to go for overkills for massive points.

With the price tag this is highly recommended for any shmup fans!",1
25340,"Definitely one of those pick and play type of games. Though I haven't played much, I can recommend it. The trailer tells most of the gameplay. You play as a someone in a spaceship defending a cargo/mother ship from enemy forces. The gameplay goes as this: the scene starts and you pretty much have to prevent the enemies that are appearing from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom of the screen. And that's it. You get upgrades every once in a while and are able to repair your cargo/mother ship in between missions. It's simple but it works. 

The only downsides are that if you die and lose all the cargo ship's health, you are done with your current game and have to try again from the beginning which I don't like, since I'm not good at these types of games. I haven't been able to progress through the story because of this. I probably won't ever but I have a feeling that other people will get good enough to finish the game.

Plays great on steam deck!",1
25341,"The first hour of technocide is amazing, as it seems like it's a fresh and interesting hidden gem. And it still could be. But the game has some pretty fundamental design problems at the same time that really prevent it from being great.

The biggest issue is the weapon balance is not good. The basic pea shooter you get at the start is the best weapon because all the enemies tend to move horizontally, and it's the only weapon with a movement pattern that deals with that. Later on you can ""fuse"" weapons which just makes them worse. Situational patterns to use other weapons (like are present in the trailer) mean you have to play worse to set them up and don't really come up in game.

The game also has issues on the steam deck. There is extreme input lag, it seems 200 ms+, and the enemies are so tiny they fuse with the background art. This is also probably going to be an issue for anybody with vision problems on a PC.

I'm still giving it a thumbs up because it's interesting from a design perspective.",1
25342,"Very fun shoot em up.
Not too heavy on the roguelite meta elements.
I'm not much into bullet hells so this one works better for me, easy to sink hour or few into this in the evenings.

Definitely recommend trying local coop, apparently works over remote play too.",1

25351,This game is really good!,1
25352,"Update: Now there is a short but helpful starting guide (Sole Seeker Basics by Allergen) under the Community Hub in the Guides section.

I'm easy to impress and like simple retro games, but... i think the dev tried to do his best, but it is just not enough, i presume the dev is probably inexperienced, they wanted too much and the result is this barebone game with a small annoyances, which could be evaded.

This review is a really small spoiler, not about the story (as far i went, there were like two hints about it), but about what you can do in the game. So, here is my impressions:

General:
- I was lost in the game, there is no help to understand how it works, you have to try and learn.
- The background story is very brief, i have no clue how far the story will go or what kind of story we get. :D
- Not much talk in the game, but the text bubbles lack the name of the talker. I mean, i forgot the name of the benefactor because they told me few times in the beginning and never again. :D
- I find the vertical doors on the space station confusing because of the perspective, i barely recognized them, also i bumped into the wall the first time and generally just annoyed me after that. :)
- On the space station there are doors which would not open for you at the beginning. After the surprise vertical doors, it was strange. Finally a door, i can recognize it, why it doesn't open?! :D
- There is a room you have to visit to left the station with your spaceship, but because you find the spaceship before that room, you wandering and wondering, why you can't interact with the ship at all.
- I find the resource gathering punishing, ever building needs several different kind of aliens to be killed and harvested.
- never felt i need a base or just to build something, except a ""capturer"" because i needed to capture an alien. But because the story just began, maybe it has a reason to build bases later...

Space:
- I was confused why i can't enter a star system, why they are restricted. I missed the text about a red star (or something like that) i should visit first. There is no history about the texts, so you can't read them later.
- in the space, i hate how slowly the spaceship turns, i missed systems several times because of it and turning back is so slooow. Also many times i have to zoom out to see where i want to go, but i can't see which direction my ship will go, because it is just a small dot when i zoom out. Also because the huge distances, zooming from ship to galaxy view and back is slow.
- Because there is no guide about the game, i wandered around the galaxy for few minutes until i finally pressed the ""switch state"" button which shows ""territories"" of the galaxy, different colors, later i figured out they represent what kind of aliens lives there. Several territories overlap each others so their star system type can be like blue, green, orange, for example. So i found a star on the red territory and i could land. After that, i could land anywhere.

Planets:
- After landing on the planet you can see what is around the ship. But when step out, the game is so zoomed in, you can see maybe like 10 meters/33 feets away. Everything is almost jumps on you.
- Every color represent a hostile alien type with the corresponding color. There are moving red goos, fast blue rat things, a green tentacle, orange volcanos spiting brown jumping rocks and finally rolling purple giant eyes. That is all. You can stun the first two with a net and kill any of them with one or more cuts and loot their colored resources. They are deadly, they touch you and you are dead. The fight is very simple, you net them or cut them before they could reach you. The corpse harvesting is slow, you can't interrupt it, so other aliens probably can kill you.
- I liked chasing the planets and the zooming animation when i land on them. I'm easy to impress. :)))
- I liked there are different biome, even if it means not much. Mostly i liked the music.

Story:
- After some exploring i had no idea where i find the space station, but i remembered there were a lot of stars, it is the center of the galaxy, so i found it. Now, one of the locked doors opened and i could make ""building types"": deployable weapons, floors and walls.
- Because i got the quest to capture a red alien, i made a capturer and with the switch state button i switched to build mode on a planet, selected the capturer and deployed it, led a red alien into it. I was not sure if i got the alien because i can't see how many captured aliens i have or how many capturer left.
- Anyway, i flew back to the station, there i could contact with the captured red alien (i captured it as it turned out). It just tried to kill me and i got some command to do some experiment on the hostile alien. I had to splash it with some liquid by leading them into a sprinkler, i cut them and finally i should reverse the direction of the alien, but i didn't figure out this. There were direction marks in the room and some thingy, but i didn't know how to use it. Supposedly more successful experiments means more reward, but i have no clue if i got something, maybe red resources? After that i got a small description about the alien in my inventory.
- Surely there is some story of it, because your benefactor sometimes gives away hints about an organism they dislike.
- Now i should capture a purple alien, which means i should kill more aliens to make anouther capturer. I think i pass.",0
25353,horrible game.  No proper tutorial.  Nonsense movements that just make the game boring.  Terrible graphics.  Refunded.,0
25354,"This game has a lot of potential, it will likely be a incredible game soon! but its still a work in progress so I can't judge.",1
25355,"Game sucks. Yeah yeah its a playtest but the game sucks. I see the idea, similar to msc and cms. Its a good idea but its poorly made. Bad performance, bad gameplay mechanic's and much MUCH more.",0

25358,"i love the idea of the game but it is far from being released , u should add some visual guides , the how to play isnt good enough ,  needs more sounds effects , and i love the jump mechanics  definitely keep that",1
25359,the game has alot of potential. has alot of customization and maintinance of the cars. the game can be a bit laggy at times but the majority pf the time it runs quite smoothly. the game is a mix of my summer car and mon bazou and i love the idea of such a big open world map,1
25360,I really like this game it's not laggy at all and can run crystal clear on most pc's. I has some bugs and it would be helpful if when you flip your car it auto flips but other then that and map bugs this game is like a 7.5/10.,1

25370,"One of the more bizarre incidents of the war happened when PACT forces somehow made their way to Canada.  Records of the original operation have mostly been lost, but it is believed that a small group of Polish and East German mechanized infantry were dispatched from Murmansk with the objective of securing either the oil transfer stations in Scapa Flow, or disrupting NATO operations in Iceland.  

Whatever the reason, and why they found themselves instead on the shores of New Brunswick, may never be known.  But on that day PACT forces found themselves deep in NATO territory with no way home.  It was fight or die, and the Great North War had begun.

Frantic 9-1-1 calls reporting the PACT landing were initially dismissed, perhaps not unreasonably, as fear mongering and paranoia.  One commander, however, saw this as an opportunity to conduct some ad hoc exercises.  The 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group had been waiting in perpetual reserve for the day they would be sent to Europe, their morale and cohesion decaying each day they sat on their hands.  So it was that when it was confirmed that PACT forces had indeed landed in Canada, a single mechanized brigade was already constructing fortifications in preparation. 

The following battle was extremely one-sided, with PACT forces taking heavy losses.  By 13:00 of the first day they had entirely withdrawn from their assault, without taking any territory from the 4th.  By 18:00, Canadian reconnaissance  had begun probing northward into what they suspected was occupied territory.  PACT forces were on alert and it was thought initially that very little intel had been gathered by NATO.  But signal discipline was poor among PACT forces, allowing the Canadian forces to identify numerous high value targets.  Throughout the night they launched several deep penetrating raids, targeting command and control centers, and the irreplaceable long range rocket batteries.

After that night's disaster, PACT commanders knew they had to break though this resistance before further NATO forces could be scrambled to the region, overwhelming them by sheer numbers.  Launching a morning attack, this time with fresh Polish troops, they hoped to break through Canadian lines, gaining access to the TransCanadian Highway and beyond it, the shipyards in St. Johns.  Maybe then they could find a way to friendly territory, or at least have a bargaining chip.  Initial attempts were fruitless against another well prepared defense, but by afternoon, Polish forces had gathered enough forces to break through several first line areas.

Unfortunately for them, the Royal Canadian Air Force had spent a sleepless night preparing for daylight operations, which they unleashed with a fury.  By 22:00, the Canadians had gone on the attack, each assault heralded by rocket sorties from a seemingly endless supply of RCAF fighter-bombers.  By morning PACT forces had been pushed back to the beach, and with no defensive positions left, they surrendered en masse to the victorious Canadians.  As quickly as it had begun, the first invasion of North America by a European power in two centuries had come to a close.",1
25371,"I was a huge fan of the Winds of Change Operations and even the minimal narrative they provided. So initially, I was a bit bumped that the new War Paths mode in this DLC would be procedually generated. But I just went into a new War Path campaign and it maintains all the thrill of the classic Operations campaign while giving you so much more room to try out all the different units in the game. And that is absolutely the right choice because with this DLC you get so many new ""toys"" to play with, the Airborne infantry option alone is worth the price of admission but there are so many new units and factions on top of that. All told an excellent DLC for an already excellent game. Can't wait to see what's next for this game.",1
25372,"A must-have DLC, it adds so much! With the new Warpath mode, you essentially get unlimited campaigns, all within the battle/reorganize/battle system we are accustomed to. Add in all of the new nations and the airborne units and the replayability of this game just increased by a factor of 10. Czechs, Dutch, Canadians, Brits, French, all with their own equipment, tactical approaches, and highly detailed models, changing countries changes the gameplay quite radically.

High quality models, graphics, and a severe attention to detail make this one of my all-time favorite wargames. Slow paced and tactical, it really forces you to think about how to deploy your forces and adjust your tactics to the units you have to work with, and the enemy you are facing.

Recommend Winds of Change 100%.",1
25373,"Absolute must-have DLC that not only adds lots of great content in the form of new nations and units, but more importantly adds in an infinite mode for operations that lets you play randomly generated missions as long as you like. The Warpaths mode is gold and has set the bar for a feature every RTS needs.",1
25374,"Excellent title and a great edition to the base Regiments game, for the price there's tons of content and as others have stated the new Warpath mode has added much replayability outside of skirmish and the scripted Operations.

Many will probably compare this to WARNO but if you can't hit 100 actions per minute and  you like slower paced cold war tactics with an emphasis on realism, fantastic AI that really puts up a fierce fight and less about multiplayer ""deck"" balancing then this the game for you.

10/10 highly recommended, now have nightmares about the Fulda Gap.",1
25375,"This is an easy recommendation for those who like the campaign mode of Regiments. It provides a massive increase to the ability to enjoy new operations and explore different army types and compositions. I think there is space to tune the capture point distribution or to generate less complicated / smaller operation segments or maps but nothing that couldn't be fixed in a balance patch. 

Very happy to see this game get a shot in the arm and the chance to spend more time with it. 

Fellow Canadians can now rejoice in ADATS: A one-of-a-kind anti-everything missile platform that our country sadly chose not to pursue or maintain long after the wall came down. It chews ammo supply but will knock down a tank just as easily as a jet at almost 3Km.",1
25376,"The perfect DLC - not just new units, but builds directly on the game's strongest parts by bringing procedurally generated operations effectively multiplying the game's variability and replayability by an order of magnitude, or two.",1
25377,"Winds of Change is a great expansion to Regiments that adds in a ton of great factions and a brand new mode.

The French and Canadians really stand apart from the other countries in game. The French have a large focus on light armor and thus focus a lot on speed and flanking, but have additional firepower compared to previous nations that focused on that (British Dragoons and Belgian recon if you a wondering). The Canadians get really good infantry and AT options, and have a whole regiment dedicated to heliborne infantry which allows you to zip all over the map. Haven't tried Dutch and Czechs yet, but they look interesting.

The real draw is Warpaths, the new roguelike campaign mode. I didn't really like the skirmish mode of this game because I didn't see a lot of replayability in just beating the AI over and over. I ended missing out on a lot of content from nations not featured in the campaign, which I loved. With the Warpaths mode, I can take any of the skirmish regiments through the game's campaign system with procedurally generated missions, creating a lot of replayability missing from skirmish.

In short, if you like Regiments, you'll love Winds of Change.",1
25378,Warpaths makes it a whole new game!  Great to have the additional nations and units added.  Interface is easy to use and smooth to operate.  Overall really enjoying the game and the new DLC!,1
25379,"If you like Operations get this dlc.

Worse part of the DLC is that it arguably ought to be integrated into the main game.",1
25380,"DLC adds procedural operations and a handful of new interesting nations; now you may take your favourite regiment through a series of highly customizable and randomized scenarios in the same vein as the original campaign (limited resources, permanent losses and continuity between battles). Choose operation length, starting units, enemies, resources and battle fatigue; then let the algorithm cook up the operation with some random conditions. 

Some new types of units are also introduced, such as the quickly deployed heliborne troops and air superiority fighters to lockdown the skies. Absolutely recommended to all Regiments fans.",1
25381,"Goedemorgen!

More Regiments, including procedurally generated Operations, heliborne platoons, multiple new [strike]M113s[/strike] nations, and Regipedia unit quotes.

Must-have if you like the base game (or wait for a sale if you're lukewarm towards it).",1
25382,"Adds replayability, new countries, airborne troops and actual air supremacy options. By far worth the purchase and glad to see a DLC that adds content, and hopeful for the game to continue down this path of quality and quantity.",1
25383,"fun gamemode, I always liked a sort of semi campaign much more than the just skirmishes",1
25384,really fun DLC especially with the new nations and the 'War Path' gamemode(at least I think it added the game mode),1
25385,"Canadian Airborne/10

In all seriousness, an excellent Expansion pack to an already excellent Real Time tactics game. War paths brings the great campaign system with a rougelite twist, the new units open up some fun manuvers (See aformentioned Canadian Airborne!) and the new countries are all welcome additions!

 Would hold the Fulda gap with angry Quebecois descending from the sky again",1
25386,"Fantastic extension of the base game. New nations that bring more lovingly modeled units, some new features like airborne infantry deployment from transport choppers. The biggest draw is the War Paths mode, though. It is essentially a random campaign generator with total user control over length, forces involved, etc. The intermission mechanics from the base game's campaigns where you refit/upgrade your platoons, purchase new task forces, and select random events are all present in war paths. Its like having an endless supply of new campaigns. Highly recommended.",1
25387,"Gee Bill, a DLC that's the price of a DLC but ads like twice the content of the base game?",1
25388,"Warpath is majestic, you get your own random/procedural generated operation with multiple steps and battles, while you reorg your forces between engagements.

My first battle was a meeting engagement during a stormy and foggy night, it was SO SO atmospheric, especially with the game tense soundtrack",1
25389,"Quite a few different improvements, a lot of new units, helicopter-borne infantry! Also a new adjustable ""sandbox"" campaign mode. If you like Regiments, you want this expansion!",1
25390,"Mfw I was expecting this to be $30-$40 but ended up being less than $20 (AUD)

There's no reason to not recommend getting this DLC. You get essentially unlimited replayability with the Warpaths mode and a whole host of other features for less than $20.

If you're interested in Regiments, you don't even have to worry about deciding whether it's worth it or not.",1
25391,"Winds of Change presents enough new content in the form of the new nations as well as the War Path mode to pretty much be Regiments 2 in a sense. It combines all the best aspects of the free-form customizable Skirmish mode with the tactical, logistical and timing considerations that come with the scripted Operations. Customization options for the new War Paths mode allow for a truly crazy amount of replayability, and most importantly allows you to live out all your late Cold War power fantasies of combined arms warfare, be it with Soviet, East/West German, American, Polish, Czechoslovak, Dutch, Belgian, British or French units, the sky is the limit.

10/10, the amount of content you can get for the low price of the DLC makes this an absolutely no-brainer MUST BUY",1
25392,"Absolute must, the new War Paths mode adds tons of replayability to the game with loads of new choices of units.",1
25393,"I love this DLC. WarPatch is a wonderfull adition. New units have same level of quality of previous ones. I fully recomend. Currently my most played ""war-sim""",1
25394,"Excellent. I love dynamic campaigns in strategy games, I wish it was more common. Narratives are great and all that, but I'm here for the strategy, tactics and action, first and foremost. And dynamic campaigns offer endless replayability, with more meat than just repeating skirmish missions.

Now all we need is a map editor, if possible. But what's included here is definitely worth the very reasonable pricetag.",1
25395,"An excellent choice for going into 'roguelike' generated campaign, excellent base game made more fun with this DLC, doesnt regret buying it at full price.

Hopefully many more contents update in the future?",1
25396,"So we get random operations...that's cool.

But I loved the original ones. Lorewhise there is not much being added sadly.",1
25397,"World in Conflict wannabe. Worse in every way.

Slower pace overall.
Difficulty poorly designed - you'll get swamped with enemy units if you play anything besides easy.
Crappy graphics.
Crappy controls (ex: you cannot use TAB to change unit selection within a group).

Cool roster, though! And still more intuitive than Warno and the likes.",0
25398,THIS DLC IS BLOODY OUTRAGEOUS! They should make us pay our entire life savings for this DLC!,1
25399,10/10  it adds so much and for a fair price to boot. Birds eye has given me so much enjoyment with this game and constantly releases banger updates. War Paths alone is worth the price but the new factions and units makes this a true masterpiece of a DLC. MUST BUY.,1
25400,"Love the DLC. 

War Paths is well thought out, engaging and challenging. The new units are great - love the helo insertions.

new factions play well and are interesting additions. This is real value for money, and a great addition for the regiments experience. 

",1
25401,I kid you not but this just got twice as good with this DLC. In terms of value and content it is fantastic. War Plans just opens up all the regiments and having a great time with it. Well done Devs !!!,1
25402,"It took me a while but I was able to finish my first War Path and it's awesome.

It plays just like an Operation in the base game, expect it's dynamic and procedural created mini campaign or operation.

New nations are cool, although nothing really amazing about them, they are a great addition. 

I would say for War Path alone it's a recommended DLC. Plus new nations, it's definitely a recommended DLC.",1
25403,"Adds a lot of content and replayability at a very fair price, with the same high quality as the base game.",1
25404,War Paths is amazing. The added factions are just the cherry on top.,1
25405,Good game turns into a great game with this DLC,1

25420,"UI is fine, idk what the other guy is talking about.

It is an idle game that you can make progress without focusing on it 100% of the time.

But there is a really well done mechanic called 'diamonds'.  It allows you to kind of store up 'idle time'.  So if you're away for a few hours it will build up and then when you get back you can play quite actively and progress really quickly.

I bought the first game and I only played an hour.  But I really like this one.  I am not too far into it but it seems to be a really good idle game.  Features keep unlocking.  If you're on the fence give it a try.",1
25421,"Its a good incremental game. I like that it doesnt focuses on resetting so often and instead more on longer runs where you push the numbers.
I just started NG+ but unfortunately it seems there is where the content ends, you can get some more multipliers each time but thats it. Anyway, worth the price if you like idle games.",1
25422,"Pleasantly surprised with this game.

-Unfolding mechanics which all tie in together in a way that's mostly easy to understand
-Unique and fun random events
-Customisable ability automation
-Clean user interface
-Pleasant sound effects and soundtrack
-No MTX/P2W",1
25423,"The UI is fine.
I refunded, but I do think there is a certain minority of people that would enjoy this game for more than 2 hours.
To me, I just saw where the game was headed and I could see than a mindless autoclicker do easily do 99% of the gameplay for me.  
I think if this was free I'd leave it running in the background.
Which is where I have a problem with this game, it isn't free. 
There are similar games (mostly mobile) that are more or less the same, and are free.   So for the price tag I do expect something more.

I am considering buying again if there is like a 70% off sale.  I bought at 10% off, but I don't think that is deep enough to warrant it taking up space in my steam library.

6/10- Good, but not good/deep enough for me to keep.",1
25424,"A pretty good idle game, but nothing compared to the first game. Some new mechanics and different systems that take up a lot more time but don't feel that rewarding. The game is mostly building up components, resetting, and repeating until you unlock a new system or a new currency. The issue persists where some of the mechanics aren't explained - how does score work? How much score do certain modules have? Is there a screen where I can see what the scores of each module are? Strange and confusing additions to the first one but still a pretty decent idler at its heart. 5/10",1
25425,"I got this game for free from one of my friends who happened to be a tester for the game and gave me his steam copy since he didn't need it. I gotta say, I'm genuinely impressed with the quality of this game. As of now, I've completed the game, outside of the time based achievements of 36 and 48 hours which are exclusively in game. For it's price, this is definitely one of the better idle games out there. Sure, it isn't graphically great, but the gameplay is fun, it's addictive, and above all, it has extraordinarily good pacing. Never once did I feel I was going way too fast or way too slow, it felt just right. This is simply an easy recommend from me. I really did enjoy playing this game.",1
25426,"The interface is stunning and the progression, albeit initially slow, is incredibly rewarding. The upgrades are thrilling, and I'm eager for the potential future acceleration. The concept is simply amazing for those seeking a casual Idle gaming experience that impresses.",1
25427,"Good second iteration on the Upload Simulator idle/incremental game. Plenty of mechanics to click through, with nicely polished UI. There's even a mobile version.
Good game overall, if you like to see numbers go up across the board.",1
25428,"Nice Soundtrack, many Layers that are unlocked after awhile.
Progress could be a bit more faster and UI is a bit confusing.",1
25429,"It's fun, but very basic tutorial that explains a couple of things.
The rest is confusing and no help in game or on net atm

The tips buttons don't scale well, ie the upload type info panel the artifact information is hidden, I scroll and see it for a split second before the window shuts, I guess it thinks I'm swiping it closed?",0
25430,"This is the second in the series.
I enjoyed the first, this one not so much.
Like a monkey with a typewriter, hitting buttons at random has got me this far.
Nothing is explained in game very well at all, much like this review.
Not recommended, play the first one if you must.",0
25431,"I started playing this game on Android and I liked it so much that I decided to buy both games on steam.
I have read negative reviews saying that this game is worse than the first one. That it is not easy to understand what is expected of your or how to play it.
It is a typical case of ""The first game is better"". People don't remember playing the game but only have a fuzzy idea of what they played.
I played the first one after being on T4 on this one and I can tell you I was completely lost on the original game.

So, acordiing to me, this game is better.

It is a very polished incremental game. In fact, the only place I hit a wall was in T4 because it is taking forever to have enough research to unlock the uber laboratory. Maybe I just don't know the best combination of hacks and modules to produce a lot of uploads very fast in order to reach enough T4 research credits.

I was able to share my android game to steam. I didn't try the reverse but it is great to be able to continue to play on my phone or vice versa!
",1
25432,"Slow start compared to the previous in the series, which I feel contributes to some of the negative reviews about ""not being as good"". It feels like it takes a lot longer until you start unlocking automation compared to the original Upload Simulator, and it's only once you do that the new mechanics start to feel like an addition to the game rather than a needless chore. Once you get past that pacing issue, it feels more enjoyable and more fleshed out. The micromanagement until you get to that point might mean you go looking for a less ""hands-on"" idler though.

You'll have seen most of the game's content within 40 hours, there's a few ""unique universes"" hidden away in a menu that it's probably quite easy to never notice even after 100% achievements. The core mechanic changes haven't interested me enough to try any.

I had fun while the game lasted, and it's super cheap when it's on sale - it's worth the price, but there's also plenty of free idle games with far more content, depth, and mechanical complexity, so it's a thumbs up but can't avoid the context that there's a lot of competition that's at least as good as this.",1
25433,"mobile game ported to pc, doesn't mean it's bad or anything. The UI is fine, and it has a slow start, compared to its predecessor. Overall good game.

I only got this for free pecause I'm a translator of the game (To lithuanian, don't expect it coming out quite soon lol)",1
25434,"Great game, used to play it on my phone but now that I have the computer version I prefer to play it here.",1
25435,"A game that is slow for no purpose other than to be slow.

Its the anime music pack from Xenoverse 2 but worse, atleast that had 11 songs with a mixture of Op/Ed and BGM and you can listen to it in the menus and around conton city and it was $5 cheaper than this (i thought that $14.99 was pricey). For this price i could probably buy the CD's with these songs, they would be the full versions, and rip them to my computer, put them on my phone, listen to them in the background while playing the game and have even more songs than what's here. The substitution items and ninja info card don't help justify the price either. I bought this through pre-order before detailed info came out, shame on me for that but didn't know if it was gonna pre order exclusive or not, could have saved my money.",0
25450,"okay this sh*t slaps,not as hard as my step dad but still damn hard. it plays songs from the anime while fighting online, sure u can just YT while you play but when ur not thinking about it, it really makes u feel great playing while the anime music is going lol 10/10 would recommend plus u get the only cool ninja info card skin thats gold. oh and a few substitution items being headphones and a mic. this makes the game feel better than it is, though i kinda hope they add more songs in the future DLC. one thing they dont list in the description is it adds an extra tier to survival cap mode. nothing crazy but if you like the base content it adds 10 extra fights. for the price is it worth? maybe on sale but im bad with money and music online is peak so its buyer dependent. if the value is there for you, by all means.",1

as background music in both Free Battle & Online matches !!
Songs rock hard, mashing buttons to Hanuka Karata or GO!!! feels amazing !
It also has 2 music related substitution items (microphone & orange headphones)
that can be used in battles, which are a nice touch!

Adding in the future (pretty please) Sadness & Sorrow, Those Who Inherit The Will of Fire

 would make this pack a 10 out of 10 for me !!

25456,"For me, it's now pretty clear why this game is for free. 

Usualy free is good, but in this case something that is free will cost a few minutes of your life, an really, this game isn't worth even that.


con's
- Time fly's (and it won't stop)
- mechanics are to simple (I increase this, than support goes up. Thats it.)
- no tutorial (but you'll get how all works within, eeeh, 30 seconds playtime
- strange use of capital letters in a lot of text
- no depth
- no story, other than a brief history of your country
- there is potential. If someone would take the time, and delete the whole game, and start from nothing rebuilding it


pro's
- doesn't use lots of storage
- you can play it even with a potatoe
- free
- you can leave a lazy review, and be one of the few people on earth with a review about Electoral Dynasty",0
25457,"This is an intresting premise and I'm glad it's free to play but I wish it was polished enough to be functional. A tutorial would be nice, and overall some mechanics should be fleshed out. I just didn't really find myself wanting to play this for more than a few minutes.",0
25458,"I can't recommend it. Its free, so no loss in trying yourself, but its simultaneously vague and confusing, but also shallow. You have a very limited number of options of what to do, and no clear guidance on any of the mechanics. Feels like a student project maybe?",0

25466,"i played this game for 1 month
its pay to win
great spender in server
u cant reach them unless u lose ur money
dont waste ur time a and money gl",0
25467,"Played extremely actively for a solid month. Here's my perspectives.

Gathering hero's and building up your troops is fun for a while. Cool system with five hero's per troop set up. Decent to customize and counter your opponents set up. Increasing their strength is more than just gaining xp in fights though. You can gather spell books to increase the hero stats. 20 of each att, def, and command per hero. Sounds great, until your running 10+ troops with over 50 hero's. Who all need to hunt 60 spell books each to max out their potential.

The city building is ridiculously grindy. As you gain levels you get the ability to have another town. At first it's awesome, and then by the time you have your main city, plus 10 more cities to develop the exact same buildings in. It feels like a punishment to get another town. Sure, having 10 level 20 tax offices, or warehouses, ect, increases your overall daily production and capacity, but it's the same buildings over and over again, and each new town starts off with nothing but a level 1 city hall. Essentially, you feel like you are starting over again, repeatedly. Ok, let's do this all over again for the how many times now?

There are ages the game goes through, and if you didn't start at the very beginning, you will NEVER catch up to the players who did. The ages go fairly fast, and if you don't make this game a part time job, you will fall behind quickly. Or P2W.

The community is actually friendly, even rivalry is generally communicated and organized. The community is very small though. About 30 active members on global server 1.

The top ten players are so strong that they can basically take down miracles and monument cities solo or in a small group. That means, unless you are online when they do this, you will never get to attack anything fun with your alliance. They already conquered everything while you were sleeping. And that's the best way to earn Merit as well. An important aspect.

You snowball as you grow and gain more and more because of your strength increase. So those top players continue to skyrocket with merit gains, while everyone snails. The distance and divide only increases.

It's colorful and definitely a mobile game ported in. It does a few things better than most games of this type, but it is absolutely not balanced at all, it has a ton of bugs, actions and in game content locked behind certain ages, so even after my play experience there are some aspects the game still hasn't even let me try or learn about. And it gets really repetitive.

I don't regret trying this game, fun for while. It would be nice if you got bonus' to your main city instead of a brand new identical, but bare city to build all over again. And then another, and another. It would be better if they balanced the game so 3 people can't run around the world taking over all of the special cities by themselves.

It's not difficult at all, just time consuming and very repetitive. Anyway, thanks for reading my experience. 

Happy Gaming Everyone!",0
25468,pay to win cash grab. dont spend on this dont invest. fun to play for min but it will die out like all these genre due to whales,1
25469,"Another pay-to-win game. It is very complex and does not have a complete guide for the many non-intuitive features of this game. The support staff are not familiar with the game and will ask for screenshots for even the simplest concern.
I must say that it has the potential to be a very addictive and stimulating game if they make a few changes:
1. Provide a built-in translator, they currently tease you with a translator for a limited amount of time and then turn it off and inform you that you'll need to pay for it.
2. Fix the bugs, some things work for some but not for others. E.g., they have a 'novice protected area' which protects you from attacks however, I've lost over 30 villages but cannot capture others villages. Support ignored the issue when I reported it.
I'll add more when I get time.
3. Too many features have vague or no descriptions e.g., archer, cavalry, and infantry 'redifs.' What is a redif and how are they obtained?
4. There are long intervals of time between ages where your heroes and lord once maxed cannot advance. The game gets very boring. Example: I'm between the Castle and Kingdom ages (14-day interval). My Lord reached maximum levels 2 days ago; 12 days until he can take advantage of xp's, So I cannot increase the number of a troops (currently capped @ 11; CC@), b) heroes CC@ 55, c) territory CC@ 129, and villages CC@ 72. Which means I cannot compete with the heroes in the various challenges as they are not restricted to the same limits.
5. They have a 'Hero Roulette' wheel that seems to be rigged to give you a 5-star hero shard that you have collect 100 before you can cash them in to get a hero.

Updated 7/17/2024, it's getting better so I'll recommend it!",1
25470,"I could write a book on how many things there are to do in this game. 
You can micro manage aspects but in essence the game is a build and fight to gain towns, cities, resources and troops.
I would recommend joining an alliance asap, also to participate in larger attacks.
Plenty of rewards and bonuses to obtain to build an your empire.
There is little atm as regards an instruction manual but other player in your alliance can help.

Very good free game that can become addictive",1

There is no translator in the chats so people can communicate in-game.  No Recall for troops (would be nice). Un Insatalled Game. UPDATE:  I decided to give it another try as they implemented translation in game and opened new servers. Cons: translator works great for free but, after about 50 messages translated, it stops & you must buy a monthly card to use it , wth ?",0
25472,"What I did not like at all was being the high levels of achievement, then being reduce to 0 to start all over again! Very very disappointing! Still don't know why! What happened!",1
25473,"Fairly standard RTS game that has been ported for PC compatibility as well as on other platforms (mobile/cell, etc).
Population of the game is somewhat on the quieter side, though at time of writing it's still newly released so that may change in the future.
There does exist microtransactions, though it's not constantly flashed in your face (at least on PC gameplay) and it's quite viable to keep up the pace as F2P if that is your style; the P2P route doesn't really give that much of an advantage as there's quite a lot of chance rolls incorporated into the game, so it keeps people at a somewhat steady flow. 

The UI could be neater and more efficient for PC play, but that may be something they work on down the line, though there is room for improvement in regards to quality, connectivity and efficiency.
The map is quite large, so plenty of space to settle.

They have incorporated ""ages"" into the game, and these act as a soft time cap, so it helps further to balance out F2P and P2P players to keep them on similar pacing. 
In-game mechanics exist to replenish energy other than paying for it, so the options are there to suit both styles of play.

The mists of the town are distracting, but it's good to know that the bloodstains and spells are specifically labeled. The rules of the game are actually quite simple, but they test the player's maneuvers.

[quote=Dean Hall]
While not a profitable project (our typical daily revenue including DLCs is around USD 800 gross, roughly 400 of which makes it to us), Stationeers is important to all of us in the studio. We hope that shows in the hard work we do with our updates, and we feel this one is no exception.

Not only does this update contain an entire new game around Rockets, it also contains a massive array of performance, usability, and general fixes. Our change log is so big that we can‚Äôt fit all of it in this post.
[/quote]

[quote=release notes]
This pack adds cosmetic uniforms featuring fifteen different international markings for wearing on characters in Stationeers.

Our DLC was made to provide a way for those who enjoy the project and want to further support it, and in return receive some simple new content. This content is not essential for the game. Consider purchasing this if you want to further provide support to its ongoing development.
[/quote]

That is what this is, and that's why you should get it.

Please support this outstanding pioneer niche product. They're probably writing gaming history. Many games of the future will have atmospherics, even though that's not key to the game, just as shooters like Half Life 2 come with a physics engine which lead to related puzzle scenes - and fun - when the core game isn't about that at all. It'll become normal, trust me. Now leave out some pizza toppings and help pull the wagon!",1
25494,Game is a true masterpiece. My all time favorite and I played a ton of survival/crafting games. Happy anniversary team Stationeers!,1
25495,"Another instant purchase, This game is a true labour of love by RocketWerkz. Can't wait to see where the new rockets take this game in the future!",1
25496,"Personally, don't really care that much for cosmetics. I just bought it because I genuinely support the developers, as their dedication to improve this game despite the low income is absolutely crazy. Keep the DLCs coming so I can keep supporting!",1

25541,"[i]Midnight Ramen[/i] is a treat to experience. A story rich game with memorable characters, each with heartfelt stories. Flavourful and full of soul. 

[h3]The Story[/h3]

You play as an apprentice to the owner of a ramen stand that operates throughout the night. As customers come in you engage with them and listen to their troubles. As time progresses you get to know the customers more and more as their stories unfold. The stories of the characters are really quite heartfelt and the writing in this game is very, very well written. 

In the background of talking to the customers the mystery of your own story starts to unfold. 

I am not going to go into specifics about the story itself as there is a twist to the whole narrative that is best experienced. There is depth to this game. If you love the Coffee Talk series (like I do) I really believe you will love this game as well. 

[h3]Gameplay & Features[/h3]

The game is divided into 14 nights (chapters) with an ending chapter and a mysterious after-story chapter. After you complete each night the game will automatically save so no save files are needed. You just boot up the game and hit continue. Or you can choose to replay any chapter (any night) at any time. The game is mainly narrative, you listen to and talk to the customers but you do not make any choices that influence the story. You cook their food and serve them drinks while conversing.

In some cases alternate endings will be available and will appear in the timeline chart (where you go to select chapters to replay), that have a question mark. 

Game settings include audio settings, dialogue speed, resolution settings, language selection and tweaking how to lift items in game (by holding or clicking them). The game does recommend keyboard and mouse to play (which I chose) but also does support controllers. 

* Due to being able to replay any chapters you‚Äôve previously played at any time makes getting the achievements much easier.

[h3]The Visuals & Audio[/h3]

Visually the game art is beautiful. Each character has some pose variations and the anime style is colorful, unique and each character has personality. The key moments in the game (and there are a few) have nice computer graphics of the characters at pivotal moments. I chose not to share any of them as they will give away important parts in the story. 

The music is lo-fi beats and very relaxing. There are no voice overs but some ambient sounds such as birds chirping and footsteps. 

[h3]Trigger warnings[/h3]

‚ùó This game does deal with some very sensitive issues like death, suicide and losing loved ones so a warning should be given to those sensitive to such issues or going through a rough time. 

I myself was in tears (happy tears) the last hour of the game. You just get attached to the characters' stories and struggles which is a sign of great character development and writing. [i]If a game can move you to experience strong emotions then it is a game worth experiencing.[/i] 

[h3]Overall Experience[/h3]

I loved this game, and I believe if you loved games like Coffee Talk (also a favorite of mine), then you will really enjoy [i]Midnight Ramen[/i]. Great story-telling and memorable characters. Also the element of cooking up the orders while listening to lo-fi beats is relaxing and enjoyable. üçú

25542,"Midnight Ramen is a narrative-heavy game that is most similar to Coffee Talk, except you make ramen, not coffee. I was pleasantly surprised by the decent writing and intriguing characters, with the ramen making minigame being very simple, but lots of fun.

[h1]Story (no spoilers)[/h1]
You run a late-night ramen stand and listen to your customers stories and struggles, trying to help them in their journeys. Each character is very unique, but doesn‚Äôt fall precisely within specific stereotypical boxes and feels as if they are their own person. As the story progresses, cracks begin to surface in the protagonist‚Äôs own life as well, as she begins to truly understand her purpose, and what lies ahead.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296451376

Clearly inspired by the likes of Coffee Talk / VA-11 Hall A, Midnight Ramen will make you feel attached to each of its characters. Although there aren‚Äôt many, and the game only lasted just over 4 hours (including 100% achievements), the stories were captivating. I was completely engaged reading every piece of dialogue to better understand their perspectives. I specifically loved how after finishing the game, you can go back into the branching chapter paths and replay specific levels and even find different endings for some of the characters. The attention to detail in Midnight Ramen surpassed my expectations and it left many options available to players to explore.

I was sad when the game was coming to an end, because of the story but also because I wanted it to continue. I wanted to hear from new characters‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt want it to end. This is very rare for me and demonstrates the games excellent storytelling abilities.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If you have played Coffee Talk, you know how this game will play. Lots of conversations between customers and also between the stall owner, which you are an apprentice to. And of course‚Ä¶ cooking ramen! I absolutely adored this minigame and the layout was very easy to use. With bright, large buttons and easy, uncluttered ingredients to choose from. However, I do wish that more ingredients and options were added as the game continued, as the ramen making minigame does not change from start to finish.

Choose your level of noodle softness, abide by the ramen recipe book‚Ä¶or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs up to you! Add sides of chashu (or others), mix your broths and don‚Äôt forget the seasoning! After finishing the story once, going back to play specific chapters to slightly change their orders and witnessing different dialogue was satisfying and displayed further depth to characters that I thought were not as developed as they could be‚Ä¶ but it was just under a hidden storyline for keen players to find.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3297113136

Dialogue can be automatically skipped by holding S, and the dialogue boxes were clean and easy to click through. Saving occurs frequently at the end of each chapter which was very handy as well.


[h1]Visuals & Sound[/h1]
Midnight Ramen features very bright, cartoonish visuals with anime-style characters. The simple style helps to focus on the dialogue and felt fitting for the setting. The ramen made me hungry and I appreciated the small details such as seeing the ramen slowly disappearing infront of characters as time passes, the cursor is in the format of two chopsticks that pinch together when you click and so much more.

Sound is ok, it has low-fi beats, similar to Coffee Talk once again, but it did feel slightly repetitive at times and lacked some variation. However, this is only a small gripe and is just something I noticed towards the end of the game. 


[h1]Technical & Stats [/h1]
[quote][b]This game was played using a keyboard & mouse, and with the following PC specs.:[/b]
AMD Ryzen R5 7600x 5.4 GHz
32GB DDR5 5200 CL36 RAM
Radeon RX 6800 XT
2560x1440 resolution

Windows 10[/quote]

[b]Playtime:[/b] The game took me approximately 4.5 hours to achieve 100% achievements and finish the game.

[b] Controller Recommended? [/b] No, but it is supported if you wish.

[b]Replayability value:[/b] To witness different story paths and for achievements only.


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Midnight Ramen completely surprised me with its quality story-telling and engaging characters. I knew it was heavily inspired by the classics of the genre such as Coffee Talk, but I did not expect the emotional depth and polished ramen minigame that it provided. I barely have any qualms about the game, mainly that I just wish it was longer. I would love to play a sequel or hope to see new content added in the future. I highly recommend this game for fans of conversational, relaxing games...just prepare for some emotional scenes ahead!

25543,"I had the opportunity to play a preview copy of this game before its release, so do bear in mind this review applies to that.

This is an excellent little story-based game where you operate a ramen stall that opens daily at midnight. People come and go, and they chat and you learn about their lives. It reminds me most of the Coffee Talk games, but also of Spiritfarer, as there is a fair amount more tragedy to their tales.

The writing for this game is very good, and I would say is the highlight of the game. The world building seemed to me to be deeper than either of the games I mentioned before, and I appreciate that. But it doesn't let itself intrude too much, the stories do remain focused on individual characters throughout. The main story is fairly short but it opens up more post-game, which I haven't explored yet.

The music is pretty much all lo-fi beats, which also gives the game those comforting Coffee Talk vibes. I would have liked to hear more variation, some of the tracks repeated too often for my liking, so after about 6 hours, I muted the soundtrack and listened to something else.

Overall, I think this is a very good 1st game from this developer and would like to see more from them in the future.",1
25544,"After playing the Demo I have been waiting for the Release of this Game more than any other and frequently been checking it up. I'm so happy it's finally here and it most certainly does not dissapoint. The vibes are immaculate and instill calm in me, the story is interesting and the characters are loveable. I'm having a wonderful time unraveling their stories and serving them ramen and I think a lot of people will to! I could (and will) be playing this for hours - but [i]beware![i] A craving for Ramen might just ensue!",1
25545,"Ever wanted a game that tugs at your heartstrings? Makes you crave good food in the middle of the night? Play Midnight Ramen.
I played the demo before and was very interested to see what the full story would be like and it made me tear up 3 separate times, so it gets a big PLEASE PLAY IT from me. There is no stressing or time limit involved when fulfilling customer's request (aside from an optional achievement that I managed to get by pure chance anyway) which is godsend. You just combine all the items in whatever order you want and if you do mess something up you can always just throw it out and try again before presenting it. The music is very cozy and the whole atmosphere of the game really envelops you in warmth. I hope we get to see more games like this.",1
25546,"So I like this game, but it has it's issues.

Good things:
- Making Ramen is fun! I like the options and the ability to mix it up when you want to, and the fact that it is a simple mechanic but at the same time really interesting to do. 
- The music is nice. It  goes really well with the story-telling
- The characters seem relatively well fleshed out, and moderately believeable!!
- Nice to just read as an activity light game

Negatives:
- This game REALLY needs to come with a detailed trigger warning. It covers a lot of things about death and related stuff, and people should really be warned properly about this before they play
- Lots of grammatical mistakes and spelling errors. If this kind of thing takes you out of the immersion, then I wouldn't recommend this game. 

Overall I would recommend this game, unless you are currently grieving or have strong emotional reactions to discussions of death.",1
25547,"I Loved this so much!  The story line wasn't over complicated, and was a little thought provoking.  i didn't feel stressed or anxiety in making the meals. I loved it when i could have some creative licensing with them also! I hope there are more  like this in the future with more characters and stories to follow, and maybe the ability to learn new recipes.",1
25548,"I can't remember the last time I was grateful to have played a game. I've definitely never dreaded the end of a game before. And I don't think I've ever cried this much for any game. 

It's not even really much of a game, more of a story but with a fun little minigame. The characters are amazing, the minigame is satisfying, and the story is... devastating.

Please. Please play this if you're in a spot to be able to. It's very heavy, it hurts to play, you know what's coming and you can't stop it. But if you can get through it, it's an amazing story worth knowing.

This is the single most impactful game I have ever played, ever, and I am thankful I randomly found it.

To the Developers: Fuck you, holy shit you wrote this, and published it, and I had no way to know it would be so beautiful. And Thank you for Coming.


Update:

I was informed that I needed to play the game again. It got better. This is the 1st game I have ever gone out of my way to 100%, period. Play this game.",1
25549,"If you enjoy connecting with people and hearing their stories over a steaming bowl of noodles, then this is the game for you!

The music and gameplay are absolutely zen-like. No pressure at all. You just sit back and enjoy constructing the most perfect ramen while interacting with relatable characters. Wonderfully unique and heartfelt story.

And did I mention that your mouse clicker is a pair of chopsticks ^_^ 

Spicy red miso ramen with extra chashu and scallions please <3

*I think it is worth noting that there are some potentially sensitive/mature themes*",1
25550,"I recommend this game. I feel like this is the game I've been waiting for. I make ramen and talk with people. Plus the lofi music is very relaxing.

I would add a disclaimer though due to some of the topics discussed can be seen as sensitive in nature.",1
25551,"Interesting, well rounded dialogues with lots of deep topics to explore if you're willing to open up. Gives off a nostalgic feeling even though you've never played before...one of those games ;)",1
25552,"coffee talk but with ramen, the game is a vibe, and you get sucked in to your customers lifes etc etc, worth getting",1
25553,"Midnight Ramen is really good. Good atmosphere, story, art, characters and music. Some moments got me a bit emotional (and that's a good thing).",1
25554,Does work well on steam deck but text is very small. It's a very chill game and well worth the price.,1
25555,"A story I needed, highly recommend for people who liked Va-11 Hall-A and similar, with Spiritfarer vibes",1
25556,"Ramen, an amazing story and relaxing music. What else would you ask for?",1
25557,"This game is good and it makes me hungry.
Will have some ramen this afternoon.",1
25558,"Oh my gosh, the ending....I was so strong not to cry but that ending got me so badly- like, I'm still trying hard not to bawl loudly at 3 AM in the morning...",1
25559,"Chilling game with lo-fi music. 
You are the ramen stall owner and your job is not only serving food but also listening to their story.
It is like chilling with a group of friends after a long day in real life.

I personally not a big fan of visual novel game, however the cooking mechanic helps a lot.
The whole cooking process is relaxing and fun.",1
25560,"tl;dr: This is a very well-written game! I have enjoyed the story and loved the cooking ""mini-game"" aspect, which felt low pressure while having a good challenge between scenes. I lost my mom several years ago at a young age and this game was a very heartfelt way to spend my evening. No spoilers in my review!

I bought this game this evening as I got an email it was available, and I've been waiting! What a great purchase. I loved every bit of the story. I wanted to play through this in one sitting to really take in the story and I'm glad I did - but it's not something everyone has to do. I just wanted to get into it through an evening on the couch under the blankets.

A big part of the game is preparing food and serving customers. It's not as in-depth as the story side of the game, so I'll knock it out first. You're tasked with cooking ingredients, preparing meals and beverages, and serving the customers. Some cooking mechanics require you to time things well, but there isn't a timer for the overall cooking experience, giving you plenty of time to review a recipe and get things right. For timed mechanics, there are audio cues to help you catch what's going on. If your meals are missing key ingredients, like a number of topping or side and beverage, you'll be warned when you pull the service cord. There's a trash can to throw items away as well. You can (hilariously) serve a meal with wrong or missing ingredients without being warned, so it's a good idea to pay attention to what they ordered, how they ordered it, and the written recipes. Fairly laid back experience with fluid drag-and-drop mouse controls for each of the cooking hotspots and clear instructions for each of the recipes, as well as tips for how to do things with each of the hotspots.

The artwork, animations, and user interface are all very nicely done. I haven't encountered any issues or bugs as of yet. Things work smoothly, controls work as expected without lag, and I'm able to find all of the information I need where I expect to find it. No complaints, well done. However, the English dialogue has a handful of grammatical errors, a few typos, the usual. A quick run-thru should clean it up, but that's on the developers. It doesn't detract much from the story.

The story is often more complex and in-depth in games than their mini-games, so that's next! The premise of the game is fairly simple. You play in part as a young, inexperienced cook at an all-night ramen stand (as well as the stand's owner) and you serve customers that bring rich, engaging stories with them each night, and looming secrets that unravel for you, the player, as you follow along with the story.  Customers go through unique circumstances and share their stories with you as they enjoy their meals. Some face tragedy and hardship and look to you for a supportive ear or shoulder to lean on. You learn about them as individuals and peek into their lives on their recurring visits to the ramen stand. Money-earning is not a game mechanic - just preparing food, serving food, and unraveling the story of the world around you.

The personalities between customers are varied and the writing feels very well done in both of these aspects. This is another difficult task to accomplish, in my opinion, and personalities/voices are hard to fully carve out in any type of literature. When an author is able to give unique and definitive characteristics to each character in the story, it adds immense depth and value. I love what they've done here to give variety to the characters in their words and actions.

The game does a great job of world building, showing without telling, by dropping tidbits of information about the different customers and the world around you. This is a huge selling point for me, because a lot of games rely on partial fourth-wall breaks or dry telling without showing. I love being dropped into the world the author has created and being able to feel, connect, emotionally, etc etc. It's a difficult task to get right and I feel like they've done a good job here with the world building and the methods for delivering information to the players. There are secrets unknown to you and you learn little things and big things as you go through each step of dialogue. I found the story to be overall engaging and I loved how it was presented.

The story itself is a roller coaster of emotions and takes you, quite seriously, through the lives of your customers and gives you many avenues to connect with them as the player. Some customers reveal lovely stories about their lives and others share their problems and look for comfort and support. There are lots of philosophical, mythological, cultural, and ideological references here as well and I enjoyed learning a few new things. There really is some incredible depth here and, without spoiling things, gives you stories with the concepts of abuse, abandonment, suicide, death, love, loss, grief, acceptance, and personal growth.

A small but important note: details were given to each scene, such as disappearing ingredients from the customer's plates and bowls as they ate through their meals, or differences in the customers as time goes on. These little touches are small but so, so appreciated. I feel like I don't see attention to detail like this as often as I did in the past, and it's nice to see it here.

Overall it's a great game. The story takes you on some twists and turns and you learn more and more about the customers you serve and the world you're in. Definitely no regrets here, just wish I could play it over again for the first time.",1

25565,"This game is very beautiful. It touches on some heavy subjects, but sometimes we need not shy away from these type of subjects.

25569,"You'll enjoy this game if you're willing to get yourself into it.

For me it's been an experience well worth the full price. There's no much gameplay. You're a cook at a ramen stall which opens at midnight and you have to serve the customers you get by cooking the noodles and adding the right broth and toppings. There're also drinks and side plates you have to take into account. You have different recipes and, usually, you must give the customer what has been ordered. Apart from that you only have to listen to what they want to tell you.  It's easy. It's an experience more than a game.

BUT... for me it's been a emotional rollercoaster and I didn't want to reach the end of the game. I wanted to continue listening to their stories. I frequently find myself wanting to finish a game. At the end is almost a chore. But with this game it's been different. This is like when you're reading a book or watching a series you really enjoy and you don't want it to finish because you know you're not going to see those characters anymore.

It's not a game for everyone. But if you're into this kind of slow, meditative games, this one's one of the best.",1

As a man of culture, I played all of Lil Hentai Games and enjoyed them thoroughly. I only bought this because I assumed it will be more of the same. Oh, how wrong I was.

Where do I even begin?

The art (and especially how it's animated) is... Very pretty, but at the same time nothing to write home about. In this entry it has a strong AI-generated vibe, though and it's certainly nothing special. It's very repetitive, because the girls' poses rarely change, it's usually just their outfits or lack of them.

That's it. That's all I can say semi-positively about this. Apart from the visuals, there's literally nothing good.

The music sounds AI-generated too. It's one of the most generic and boring pieces of [i]muzak[/i] I ever heard. It's better to just play some lo-fi beats to sleep/study to in the background.

The UI is glitchy jank.

The casual puzzle gameplay from previous entries is gone. Now you just click through dialog.
That would be OK, but there are also RPG-style TESTS to pass if you want to impress the girl in a certain way. To pass, you throw a 20-sided die, as in D&D. If the die's result combined with your perks is at least as high as the test's difficulty, you pass. Talking to girls gives you experience with causes you to level up and unlock perks which can raise your chances in 4 ""attributes"" for the purpose of these tests. This whole mechanic is just a huge waste of time and effort and brings literally nothing of value.

To pad the game's content, there are cards to collect. You get cards when you reach a specific point or outcome in a conversation. Most often these are connected to certain tests and their results. So, if you want all the cards for a certain girl, you need to replay all of their conversations, [b]without any skip feature[/b], attempt different tests than before, and succeed/fail as needed. Fortunately the cards give you a strong hint on how to get them, but it doesn't help the overall game and ultimately doesn't bring anything of value either.

The example of an end-game loop looks like this:
[olist][*]Click to load conversation
[*]Click 20 times, but not too fast, to get to a choice
[*]Select a test of difficulty 5 that you need to fail
[*]Roll a natural 20
[*]Click 30 times, but not too fast, to end conversation
[*]Click the button to restart conversation, which is not possible without doing all the above steps first
[*]GOTO 1[/olist]

And you will have to repeat this over and over for up to 20 minutes per easy test you want to fail, because the dice rolls in this game are broken. How can you fail so hard to program a simple dice roll? How on Earth is that possible? A difficulty of 5 should mean that you will fail 25% of the time. It should be astronomically unlikely to pass 20 times in a row. Yet, here we are.

And this could all have been fine for me, because I was a fan once. But the writing also went downhill. It used to be that the girls in this series had cute personalities. Their dialogues were [b]short[/b], but fun. Psychologically believable, let's say. Especially with each sequel, when it was already established that these girls were FWBs with the main character named after you, the player. They sounded like girls who seem fun to be around and they spoke things that people do say to each other in real life. I actually 100% these previous games just to see all the dialogue. Because it was fun.

Now? Well, now every girl addresses you as [b]anon[/b] IRL (every girl pronouncing it differently). Why??? What kind of pron-brained redditor might have thought this to be a good idea? The dialogues are much longer and complete cringe. Instead of just flirting with each other in a manner not requiring suspension of disbelief, the characters somehow regurgitate sentence after sentence of complete and utter meaninglessness that is difficult to bear. They literally talk about nothing ""Ooooh I like the place, so cool!"", ""Oh did you know ninja were created in the XVI century? So interesting."", ""Wow, anon! Your knowledge is so impressive! I like you so much!"".

Worse still, the girls now have full voice over. Half of them sound flat and boring, reading every single sentence in the same way, like a machine. Yet, it's not Text-to-Speech. I'm not sure that's a good thing, because these are the better half. The other half sound like some mass-produced Chinese V-Tuber. Like the fuggin pine pepsi woman on DikKok. Or like Maangchi. It's full-frontal cringe with engrish pronounciation and a thick East-Asian accent. It's not sexy at all.

This game should have profile features disabled, because, unfortunately, unlike the previous games in this series, it is blatant shovelware that you can 100% in under 2 hours ez and refund. Unless you want to farm the cards too.

[h3]All the above elements combined make the experience with this game feel like being isekai'd into a 4chan sexual RP thread or like being subjected to subliminal hypno hentai messaging by a couple of Chinese Communist Party scam agents incompetently impersonating cute girls with excessive AI filters to steal your secrets. Like, Jesus Christ.[/h3]",0

Currently right after launch this game is unplayable. Leaving the game leaves the save file corrupted and you'll have to restart. Characters have random textures attached to them.

The entire gameplay is hoping you roll the right number over and over for no reason. There's 4 characters in total with maybe 100 voice lines in total and you can finish this game in under an hour with nothing to do. Please never release a game in this state again.

8/10 art

voice acting is kind of all over the place but I enjoyed 3/5 of the characters' VA performances... but the characters call you ""anon"" which is hella weird

would be a thumbs up if they just remove the ""game"" aspects and made it a visual novel and fix the usage of proper noun",0
25582,"Game's ok so I'll thumbs up since Steam still hasn't learned that a thumbs sideways would provide for more accurate ratings.

Poor voice acting that you have you don't have to suffer through since you can mute and read the text.  Art doesn't really match to previous games, and the writing was definitely never looked at by either a woman or a guy with dating experience.  Poor programming as well since every time I clicked the ""Quit Game"" button it spiked my CPU to 100% and would never close without being killed in task manager.",1
25583,"This game is not bad, especially when it comes to the replay value where you need to collect all 69 / 69 collectible cards. And the best thing is, it tells you exactly where to get it after you unlock all the scenes, as in complete the game in the first run. For the girls, they are pretty as usual, but somehow lacking a bit of something, like expressions? Also, there are too few scenes of them, especially for Ari. The background arts looks kinda bland and it could use more touch-up. However, as this game has voice-over, it's not too shabby but like most players stated, it's kinda flat, probably using A.I. ? I'm not sure though but the voice-over is a nice touch to the game. The gameplay mechanic is new in this one, all depends on the RNG of the dice and it's a visual novel instead of puzzles like the predecessors. So, it's easy to play and you can play according to your own pace. That's good! Anyway, to cut it short, this game is worthy of time and money, more so that it's on sales now. As for me, it's enjoyable. That's it.

However, the poor programming with with the .log and .sav files becoming corrupt after returning to the title screen or exiting the game makes it a pain in the ass to have to close the game, replace the files with backup files, and reopen it each time I want to revisit the scenes.

The perks, dice rolls, and dialogue don't matter at all once you figure out you can return to them after completion. Collecting all 49 cards is pointless because you only need 20 for the Steam achievement. When I learned that, I thought to myself: [i]What was the point of all my decisions?[/i] Then I have an existential crisis. [i]What am I doing with my life? Wasn't I supposed to become a Nobel Prize scientist? Why am I moping around playing hentai games?[/i] These negative feelings aren't worth it. I bought the game for pleasure, not displeasure.

25588,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

This is not a puzzle game like the Mosaique Neko Waifus games, it is a simple visual novel game with a 20-sided dice roll mechanic for different personality traits. Excellent art and awesome voice acting, A common bug I witnessed was the disappearance of the ""continue"" button sometimes after dialogues. Quitting the game sometimes causes it to crash. Achievements are nice but tedious to collect because you can't skip already seen dialogues. The R18 DLC is great but there could've been more scenes.

In conclusion, there is not enough content in this game and it feels lazy and uninspired. If you simple want to watch a couple of voiced 2.5D (and if you choose, naked) catgirls, this is a decent ""game"".",0
25589,"""Anon's Neko Waifus"" is a visual novel developed by a studio specializing in anime and console culture. The game invites players to enter a world where the main character meets several ""neko"" girls - half-human, half-cat.
The graphics in the game are made in anime style and it can be noted that the character designs are quite attractive. If you like bright and colorful animation, then you will be pleased. However, it should be noted that this game contains some animations with explicit content, so it is intended for adult players only.
The plot of ""Anon's Neko Waifus"" is quite simple, exploration involves meeting various characters and making connections. Your task will be to get to know the ""neko"" girls better and make decisions that will affect the outcome of their stories. Even though the storyline isn't particularly original, it might grab your attention if you're a fan of anime-like stories.
One of the game's downsides is its limited length. Since this is a visual novel, you will only have to spend a few hours to complete the game. Some players may feel there is a lack of depth and longevity in the gameplay.
Despite these shortcomings, ""Anon's Neko Waifus"" can offer some entertainment for fans of anime games and visual novels. If you like these types of games and are interested in exploring stories with compelling characters, then it might be worth giving this game a chance. However, if you are not a fan of the anime style or are looking for a deeper and richer gaming experience, then it is better to turn to other options.",1

25594,"I recently dived into the world of Neku Waifu Anona, and boy, was it an unexpected delight! As a gamer with a penchant for unique and engaging experiences, this game managed to hit all the right notes.

To start, the art style is an absolute feast for the eyes. The character design, vibrant colors, and attention to detail contribute to a visually stunning environment. It's evident that the developers poured their creativity into crafting a world that's not only captivating but also visually charming.

Gameplay-wise, Neku Waifu Anona offers a refreshing take on the genre. The controls are intuitive, and the mix of action and strategy keeps you on your toes. The storyline is surprisingly immersive, with unexpected twists and turns that had me hooked from the start. It's rare to find a game that combines solid gameplay with a compelling narrative, but Neku Waifu Anona nails it.

One standout feature for me was the soundtrack. The music complements the game's atmosphere perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. It's clear that the developers invested time in curating a soundtrack that elevates the overall gaming experience.

I also appreciate the character development in the game. Anona, in particular, is a well-crafted character with depth and personality. The interactions with her felt genuine, adding an emotional layer to the gaming experience that I didn't anticipate.

In conclusion, Neku Waifu Anona exceeded my expectations. It's a game that not only entertains but also surprises and engages on multiple levels. Whether you're a fan of the genre or simply looking for a fresh gaming experience, Neku Waifu Anona is a must-try. I'm excited to see what future updates and expansions this gem of a game has in store!",1

You will need to setup mouse controls or use the touchscreen.

For $4 it was meh considering it has some AI generation help.
The soundtrack is a bop and the character art and animations are cute. The dice rolling and perk mechanic was a funny gimmick.
It had shallow, basic characters. No real story is present. It's more like short, disconnected scenes. The whole thing can be aced in two hours. The voice acting was... ""fine"" and a audio balance pass would have been a good touch before release.",0

25599,"As always, these games can be enjoyed with one hand or to lighten the mood through character dialogue. In this game, the developers have taken a different approach from the traditional puzzle-based gameplay, creating a visual novel that uses the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) system (in the form of dice, which allows players to demonstrate their Charisma or Knowledge in various areas).

The artwork has improved, as always, with this developer's work. With the release of each new game, the developer continues to improve the overall experience, making it more enjoyable. The background music provides a relaxing atmosphere, and it doesn't interfere with gameplay. The Neko-Waif characters are well-drawn and pleasant to look at.
The developer continues to showcase his love for the latex costumes, which adds a unique touch to the game. The funny dialogue ensures that players will laugh and enjoy the experience.",1
25600,"The interesting idea of the game itself, pleasant and relaxing music, a few accidents, as well as elaborate scenes make it exciting and unforgettable.",1
25601,"It's encouraging to witness the ongoing improvement in animation skills by the developers behind this series, particularly evident in the stunning portrayal of the catgirls.
Within the game, interaction is limited to conversations with only four girls, where the reward lies in glimpses of them without attire. However, beyond this initial allure, the gameplay lacks depth. Conversations offer choices, some contingent on passing checks for characteristics like charisma. 
Ultimately, while the game may hold some appeal, particularly for fans of the genre, it's advisable to wait for a discount before making a purchase.",1
25602,"Nice characters, the voiceovers are good too. 
For the price of 2 dollars I think it's a normal purchase, also cool mechanics with dice rolls .",1
25603,"It has voice acting in a game that is less than $5. Some of the art looks a little off, but overall the art is pretty good.",1
25604,"Once again, like the other games from this publisher the art for this is amazing.  All the characters are great and the designs are well done, the detail is exceptional. Likely the best art in cheapy H games. It is also fully voiced which is new.

Compared to the previous games, the gameplay has been changed.  Now its more of a visual novel, with branching dialogue options protected by skill checks via dice rolls.  You can earn points for winning the dice rolls that add bonus points to your dice rolls. This is done by choosing your perks, giving you the edge in winning over the hearts of the 4 girls. Your choices don't really matter, and win or lose you can usually progress to the next scene, or just ""replay"".


At the moment it seems slightly unfinished.  Everything is there looks great, the voicing is fine and the dialogue is ok.  It could benefit massively from a art gallery. There is a way to revisit everything, but it has the dialogue boxes popping up. It also looks like the perk tree has text specifying a unused method of purchasing the perks. Just feels like it needs a bit more.

All in all you'll get maybe 30 minutes of play out of it.  Its certainly not as engaging as the other games, as you actually had something to do there.  But by the end it gave you chronic eye strain! This is more read the text, chuckle a bit. feel lonely that this sort of thing never happened to you in your twenties (not that neko girls exist) and then look at the achievements that remain after completing the game and attempt to back track and fail/pass exhaust all options.

Personal Opinion:
I really enjoy this game a lot, it is constantly being updated and the developers truly listen to their players, any small bugs are fixed nearly right away and the game gets some quality of life improvements as well. The newest character added in version 1.1.0 is my new favorite, I jsut have to admit admit, all the girls are starting to occupy my entire headspace whenever I think of the Neko Waifus franchise, it is quite a sweet one if you're into it and don't care about what other people would think if you play it. This game is really fun, and I cannot wait to see what developers will come up with for this game. Keep up the good work yall!",1
25609,"I'd say this game has an interesting gameplay concept, with the combination of an rpg-like dice rolling system. but there are still some certain bugs that hold it back from being a well developed game. Major bugs such as the ones that prevent you from playing the game, or even corrupting the save file itself is very devastating. Aswell as some more minor bugs like stacking perks, but with no additional increase, so it just eats your point with no return on investment. Though, hope you can continue developing this game into something greater!",1
25610,"The only good thing I can say about this game is the art, but other than that it is a big mess. There are glitches where it deletes my file, the characters' bottom half is not rendered, or it does not unlock achievements. As I have played these games more bugs and glitches have arisen and it seems disappointing because I like the games they make with the great art and fun puzzles it's nice that they are trying to change it up now with the voice acting and not making it a puzzle game but I feel it is straying away from the reason I have liked this franchise so much. Overall, I don't recommend this game in its current state. 4/10",0
25611,"It is painful to say this but, this feels like a prototype of something great rather than a complete experience.
This is also the first VN game they make which means they are experimenting.

Pro
- Character art is eye candy
- the dice roll and RPG mechanic were interesting for VN anyway
- The chibi art on the collectible card is nice.
- the intro to the scene was pretty nice.

Cons 
- This should be standard for all VN but the lack of log, replay voice dialogue. Save, and load ( Unlocks after you finish the game). But imagine if the routes were longer, it would be torture if you want to go back to choices or reread a line.  
- Art feels inconsistent. I think this is because trying to put the character in the background with a different art style makes them feel floaty. I think a more traditional VN format will work better. 
- the game is short, WAY too short for 4 characters. It is very hard to feel immersed in such a short time. 
- Personal opinion I would love to read more inner monologue of the character. It doesn't have to be complex nor give a blank character a personality, but just as a guide on how should I feel in a particular scene.

You know what I see potential in this style. Keep cooking!

and best part, there is no quick exit tabs/screen, now you must click 7 times again to close all Tabs/options you have chosen...WTF!?!?!!?
Grinded to get lev8 Heroes, with a 3 Exp gain per Mob and you need several 100 Exp to levels and each mob/battle takes few minutes, not becouse anything is too hard to beat, just by all clicking you must do..click click click click click..that one 1 attack, only 24 more to kill one mob, often come in groups of 3...just 100 more clicks to gain that 9 Exp in total.

Game have 7 items, shows 8 but one is parts, so combine 5 small stones into a Stone..that works..whoohooo
Can you so anything with Stones, Nope. You get wood and coins..can you do anything with it..Nope
Have 1000's of every resource in game, but cant use anything. It says we can craft..where, when, how???

Last bad thing, nothing is Idle with this game, you must click on EVERYTHING, no ticking incomes or anything.
If not click, nothing will happen. Hate all games with Idle label and not Idle at all.

How can this game have 14 positive reviews ?? Only Crow guy and someone that did not sleep for 12 days have given positive!?!?!",0
25630,"An idle game that was made in some RPG maker game, looks like it's some mobile one? There's an option to equip things, but there's no things.

It's REALLY really basic. Click bucket for water. Water plant. You grow plant. Get flower. Feed a thing the flower. Another spawns and there's weird baby slug looking things of the creature.

You buy a poop hole to get poop to be able to grow more plant. Rinse repeat. Or also sell baby to get more food???? Doesn't tell you anything at all, click around until you find out what to do. Or the video that's in the pictures/videos for the game, watch that. It tells you the gist of the whole game.

Also the game has cosmetic DLC for $5, $10, and $15 USD each. All they do is change how the things look.

I wouldn't really suggest anyone play this. There's like a few minutes of gameplay here at most.",0

At the time of my completion all endings of Mimicries are NOT out yet. Therefore, I will not comment on its story yet.
As a horror puzzle game from a small company, it‚Äôs good. 
Majority of the game is pixel art. Still beautiful though.
The main gameplay involves exploration and puzzle solving.
The puzzles get progressively harder, but there are optional hints if you ever get stuck. 
The game is strategic in their save point placements, so remember to save often. 
Very minor jump scares and some chase/hide sequences, nothing too extreme.

25640,"[h2]MimiCries: A Victorian Nightmare[/h2]

MimiCries is a psychological horror adventure game that weaves a chilling tale of mystery and suspense within the confines of the Griswald mansion. This Victorian-era setting serves as a backdrop for a narrative-driven experience that blends exploration, puzzle-solving, and atmospheric horror.

Players assume the role of a nameless protagonist, venturing into the depths of the mansion armed only with wit and a lantern. The game's core gameplay revolves around exploration and puzzle-solving, with a heavy emphasis on atmosphere and storytelling. As you navigate the labyrinthine corridors of the mansion, you'll encounter a series of intricate puzzles that require careful observation and logical thinking to solve.

The game's visual style is a standout feature, with meticulously crafted pixel art that captures the essence of the Victorian era. The mansion is brought to life with intricate details and a haunting ambiance. Sound design plays a crucial role in creating a sense of dread and isolation, with eerie background noises and unsettling sound effects that contribute to the game's overall atmosphere.

Light is a central mechanic in MimiCries. Your lantern is your only source of illumination, casting long shadows and revealing hidden details. However, it also attracts unseen horrors lurking in the darkness. The interplay between light and darkness is a core element of the game's horror elements, as players must carefully manage their light source while navigating the mansion's treacherous corridors.

The narrative unfolds through environmental storytelling and cryptic clues. Players must piece together the mansion's dark history and uncover the secrets hidden within its walls. The game's pacing is deliberate, allowing players to immerse themselves in the atmosphere and unravel the story at their own pace.
While MimiCries excels in atmosphere and puzzle design, the game's horror elements might be more subtle than outright terrifying for some players. The focus is on psychological horror, building tension through atmosphere and narrative rather than jump scares.

Overall, MimiCries is a captivating experience that offers a blend of exploration, puzzle-solving and atmospheric horror. The game's Victorian setting and pixel art style create a unique and immersive world. While the horror elements might be more subdued than in some other titles, the game's emphasis on atmosphere and storytelling is commendable. If you enjoy slow-burn horror games with a strong narrative focus, MimiCries is definitely worth exploring.

25642,i bought this to be the first review.,1
25643,"The [b][i]Isonzo: First Wave[/i][/b] DLC bundle is a rich and immersive addition to the World War I shooter, expanding the game‚Äôs customization options with historically accurate uniforms, headgear and facial accessories. Combining four core packs‚Äî[i]Elite Units, Alpine Units, Veteran Units and Reserve Units[/i]‚Äîthe [i]First Wave[/i] bundle adds a comprehensive array of cosmetic content that covers a wide spectrum of soldiers from elite combat veterans to rear-line troops. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of historical accuracy or just want to personalize your characters, this bundle offers a wealth of engaging options.
[h2][b]A Deep Dive into History - The Core Unit Packs[/b][/h2]
The [i]First Wave[/i] DLC pulls together four distinct unit packs, each focusing on a unique aspect of the Italian and Austro-Hungarian military forces. This variety ensures that players can find a style and look that matches their personal preferences while keeping the experience historically grounded.
[h3][b]Elite Units Pack[/b][/h3]
The [i]Elite Units[/i] Pack introduces some of the most specialized and highly regarded soldiers on both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian sides. On the Italian front, players get access to the Bersaglieri Cyclists, a unique and mobile unit known for their agility and speed. These soldiers come with a distinct feature‚Äîfolded bicycles on their backs, which adds a quirky but historically accurate detail to their appearance. Also included are the Arditi, Italy‚Äôs elite shock troops, known for their daring combat tactics and instantly recognizable Fez hats.
On the Austro-Hungarian side, the pack features the feared Bosnian troops. These soldiers were known for their discipline and fearsome fighting style and the ruggedness of their uniforms reflects their elite status. The [i]Elite Units[/i] Pack also includes five iconic mustaches and three facial items, allowing players to give their soldiers a distinctive, battle-hardened look.
[h3][b]Alpine Units Pack[/b][/h3]
The [i]Alpine Units Pack[/i] shifts the focus to the cold and unforgiving landscapes of the Alps, where soldiers from both sides had to endure freezing conditions. This pack outfits Italian troops with snow camouflage uniforms, helping them blend into the snowy battlefields. These uniforms capture the essence of high-altitude warfare, where survival depended as much on the ability to endure the environment as it did on combat readiness.
For the Austro-Hungarian forces, the pack provides thick greatcoats that are both visually imposing and functional. The heavy fur-lined coats and winter headwear make these soldiers look like they‚Äôre ready to withstand the brutal cold, while also showcasing the aesthetic of winter warfare. The attention to detail, from balaclavas to snow goggles, makes the [i]Alpine Units[/i] Pack a must-have for players who appreciate cold-weather aesthetics. It also includes five wintery mustaches and beards, adding even more ways to customize your soldiers to match the frozen terrain.
[h3][b]Veteran Units Pack[/b][/h3]
For those who want their soldiers to look like they‚Äôve been through the worst of the war, the [i]Veteran Units[/i] Pack delivers. This pack focuses on battle-scarred, gritty soldiers who have survived the horrors of trench warfare. The uniforms are worn, dirty and reflect the experience of hardened troops.
The Italian side gets the famous [i]Sardinian ""Sassari""[/i] uniforms, a symbol of resilience and determination in the face of overwhelming odds. These uniforms are rough and battle-tested, showing the wear and tear of extended service on the frontlines. The Austro-Hungarian faction receives the [i]Hungarian Honved[/i] uniform, known for its veteran status and loyalty to the empire.
This pack also includes five iconic mustaches and four facial items, allowing players to create soldiers who look as tough as the battles they‚Äôve fought. The [i]Veteran Units[/i] Pack is perfect for players who want to command troops that have clearly seen their fair share of combat, with uniforms that tell a story of survival and perseverance.
[h3][b]Reserve Units Pack[/b][/h3]
The [i]Reserve Units[/i] Pack offers a different perspective on the war, focusing on the rear-line and support troops who were crucial to the war effort but often overlooked. These units may not have the same battle-hardened look as the elite or veteran soldiers, but their uniforms offer a fascinating glimpse into the less glamorous side of war.
On the Italian side, players can equip their soldiers with the uniforms of the [i]Carabinieri Reali[/i], Italy‚Äôs military police. These troops were responsible for maintaining order and discipline and their uniforms, complete with archaic hats, reflect their formal and authoritative role. On the Austro-Hungarian side, the [i]Standsch√ºtzen[/i] uniforms represent older reservists and defenders, who played a key role in supporting the war effort despite not being frontline combatants.
This pack includes four mustaches and four facial items, giving players the ability to outfit their support troops with a more refined, dignified appearance. The [i]Reserve Units[/i] Pack is ideal for those who want to explore the diversity of military roles beyond the battlefield, adding depth and variety to the Isonzo experience.
[h2][b]A Wealth of Customization[/b][/h2]
The [i]First Wave[/i] bundle‚Äôs true strength lies in its wide range of customization options. With over 50 cosmetic items, including uniforms, headgear, mustaches, facial items and new faces, players can craft their soldiers to match their vision. Whether you‚Äôre looking for the polished appearance of an elite officer, the rough and ready look of a trench veteran, or the formal attire of rear-line troops, the variety in this bundle ensures that you‚Äôll find the perfect look.
The historical accuracy of the uniforms and accessories also adds to the game‚Äôs overall immersion. Every detail, from the design of the uniforms to the headgear and facial customizations, reflects the realities of World War I, enhancing the sense of authenticity that Isonzo is known for.
[h2][b]Cosmetic-Only, but Deeply Immersive[/b][/h2]
While the [i]First Wave[/i] DLC is purely cosmetic and doesn‚Äôt alter gameplay mechanics, its impact on the visual experience is significant. The different styles of uniforms and accessories add a new layer of immersion, allowing players to feel more connected to the history and the characters they control. From the elite units of the Bersaglieri Cyclists to the rugged trench veterans, the diversity in appearance brings the various facets of World War I to life.
For players who appreciate historical detail and character customization, the [i]First Wave[/i] bundle offers a deeper engagement with the game, turning every soldier into a unique reflection of the era. Whether leading a charge through snow-covered mountains or commanding reserve troops behind the frontlines, this DLC enhances the overall Isonzo experience by making it more personalized and authentic.
[h2][b]Verdict[/b][/h2]
The [b][i]Isonzo: First Wave[/i][/b] DLC is an excellent collection for players who want to enrich their experience on the Italian Front with a wide variety of customization options. By combining the [i]Elite Units, Alpine Units, Veteran Units[/i] and [i]Reserve Units[/i] packs, this bundle provides a comprehensive look at the different types of soldiers who fought in World War I. The attention to historical accuracy, from the ruggedness of the veteran troops to the elegance of the officers, ensures that every player can find a look that suits their style.
For players who value immersion, historical accuracy and customization, the [i]First Wave[/i] DLC is a must-have. Whether outfitting your troops for the brutal winter or leading a squad of elite units into battle, this bundle brings the soldiers of the Italian Front to life with authenticity, variety and attention to detail.",1

25646,"Rhino Runner is a platform indie game where the player needs to avoid deathly traps in order to find balloons in different maps. I have not enjoyed playing this game, since the controls are quite wacky and annoying. It consumes a lot of GPU. And the music is very repetitive and silly. Not recommended. 4/10.",0
25647,"It reminds me of Ninja Warrior contest on TV, but with simple and easy mechanics, and the path is wild and you don't need to go through every trap actually. The traps are moviving spikes pillars mostly, with some rotating doors and sand bags to push you down from the path. It's not that easy when you start playing, and there's no checkpoint so no tolerance to any mistakes. I managed to beat level 1 but that level 2 is too difficult as everything goes x1.5 faster. 

Overall it's a relaxing little game, adding a timer and a leaderboard would be more fun.

25648,"You play as a Rhino, and have to overcome very hastily assembled obstacles. There isn't much more to say about the game or the developer who has released 12 games this year alone. At least it is cheap.

25649,"[quote][b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/b]
Rhino Runner is a Digital Homicide style asset flip, or what Valve calls a ""Fake Game"". The ""developer"" paid for/pirated a few Unreal Marketplace packs, dumped them all in a blender, and submitted it to Valve as if they're real game developers.[/quote]

Two notable criteria for what makes an asset flip instead of legitimate use of stock assets are whether those assets comprise the majority of the game, and whether the ""developer"" properly credited the people who created most of the assets in the game.  This game fails both of those tests.  The ""developers"" here didn't credit any of the artists and real, actual game developers who created the assets here, so this is plagiarism, as well as cash grab shovelware.

In this case, the asset flipper took a bunch of Unreal assets like the rhino character, which he stole from the [url=https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/Bn5Om/fighters-pack]Fighters Pack[/url], created by actual game developer, Maksim Bugrimov.  These stolen assets got dumped on a very poor quality, lazy third person platformer template.  This is possibly in violation of the ArtStation Standard License, but Tero likes breaching intellectual property and copyright licenses to dump this toxic garbage onto Steam, as a paid product.  It has no value or merit as a real game.

Tero Lunkka/Valkeala Software have shown a repeat pattern of unethically dumping other people's work onto Steam as a cheap, nasty cash grab, through this account or through closely linked/alt accounts.  Here's some examples so you can see for yourself:

[/list]

Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The game assets are fairly mediocre/low quality, in some places they appear mismatched... Ultimately the quality of these assets, and thus the overall visual quality is lower than average, and low quality always makes for a less than optimal gaming experience.  Remember, we're looking for the best of the best of 100,000+ games on Steam.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 5 players, and the worst part is these weren't genuine players, these were the Russian fake review accounts that the developer paid to make the fake reviews.  Since the fake reviews are all done, now the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

It's also important to note the ""developer"" here has connections to a number of shady Russian asset flippers and review manipulators who show an organised pattern to scam and defraud gamers with fake reviews and asset flipping the work of others for profit.  While reviews are about the games, gamers should be informed when developers act unethically.   Whether these connections are the same developer using multiple accounts, or just working closely with other unethical developers, gamers should be warned about the harm to gamers by this developer and their associates.  Buying games from unethical developers puts your money at risk.

[quote][b][url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/01/18/steam-takes-down-art-of-stealth-after-developer-posts-fake-reviews/?sh=750e13e12354]Warning: Review Manipulation![/url][/b]

This game features a number of fake positive reviews from accounts known to be in the business of review manipulation/paid reviews.  They're all written in either Russian or broken English, appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and the accounts are used consistently to write fake reviews for asset flips and other cash grabs/scams.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be disregarded due to this blatant, unethical review manipulation.  This is done to deceive and scam gamers into paying for a bad product.[/quote]

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Rhino Runner is relatively cheap at $2 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Remember that if you buy a game from an unethical developer, you're putting your money at risk.

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.[/quote]

Rhino Runner is a casual arcade game developed by Tero Lunkka games.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

Right from the start you have the opportunity to choose from 9 different cards, which differ from each other. The main character is a tough rhino that moves gracefully through the map despite its size and weight. Your task is to collect balloons in each section. The levels contain moving objects, rotating objects, moving deadly traps like moving spikes and moving balls. Also if you try to get off the map you lose and your progress is gone and you have to start from the beginning. Precise jumps and skill are the key to success. The whole thing is accompanied by suitable music. It is controlled with a mouse/keyboard, which is easy to use.

Du hast von Anfang an die M√∂glichkeit aus 9 verschiedenen Karten zu w√§hlen, welche sich unterscheiden voneinander.

Deine Aufgabe besteht darin, Ballone zu sammeln in den jeweiligen Abschnitten. Die Levels enthalten sich bewegende Objekte, rotierende Objekte, sich bewegende t√∂dliche Fallen wie sich bewegende Stacheln und sich bewegende B√§lle. Auch wenn du versuchst abseits der Karte zu kommen, verlierst du und dein Fortschritt ist weg und du musst ganz von vorne beginnen.  Pr√§zise Spr√ºnge und ein Geschick sind der Schl√ºssel zum Erfolg. Begleitet wird das ganze von einer passenden Musik. Gesteuert wird mit Maus/Tastatur was gut von der Hand geht.

Overall, this is a fun arcade-style time waster with some neat End of Watch-style elements. There are some flaws, though.
- No subtitles (makes it hard to figure out who is who).
-Can't skip some of the cutscenes (especially the intro one, even on repeat playthroughs).
-No separate mode that allows checkpoint restarts or extra lives (Would've loved the option along with the hardcore mode that restarts all the way from the beginning.)
-Some shots appear to require specific placements, making it awkward to hit (especially the last suspect at the end of the first level).

Edit 2: Just completed the entire game. Hope to see more someday.

Rating: 8/10",1
25665,"It's short, but it's a pleasant nostalgia trip back to classic FMV rail shooters.

The story is something out of an action B-movie. You play the last remaining cop after your unit is attacked. The story won't blow you away, but it's still good. The video quality is excellent, however it is unfortunate that it cannot be rewatched as a bonus feature. You cannot skip uninteresting parts, such as the intro sequence, whenever you start or die. Dying is extremely simple.

The gameplay involves shooting enemies as they show up on the screen. You use the left mouse button to shoot and the right mouse button to reload. The mechanic works, but it looks strange. When you shoot an enemy, it appears to glitch into the video for a few seconds. You can also keep shooting at it until the visual glitch repeats two or three times. Kills earn you points, but it doesn't matter. 

The challenge is to remember when the enemies appear, as it is quite difficult to complete the game on the first try. You must eliminate enemies as soon as you spot them, or you will lose one of your three lives. Sometimes you have to start shooting at a location just to survive. You can die in extremely cheap ways, like when an enemy destroys the robot you control over a tablet, but that is the hallmark of this genre.",1
25666,The game is pretty short but fun. If you're bored and want something laid back and just shoot then this is it. there are a few bugs where you would shoot straight on the enemy and it wouldn't count therefore loosing a life and most likely starting from beginning. yeah there are no checkpoints which is annoying but makes you pay attention and really tests your reaction time.,1

25673,"I played this for a good 2 1/2 hours and really enjoyed it. The character selection is adorable, and the graphics are cute. Fans of survival games will enjoy this, especially if you like couch-coop and online multiplayer or would just like to play solo.

It's easy to learn and easy to play. It has ""crossroads"" where you have to decide between two paths so you can challenge yourself to make the gameplay a little more difficult if you find it too easy. Overall, it was really fun. I haven't encountered any problems during the playtest other than the game lagging/freezing for a few moments while at a crossroad.

Is it bad? No, not at all. As the description says, it is a project from some students, so lets cut some slack for that.
However, it is not a full game at all, not even a trial i would say atm.
I am glad to see that the project has received an update a few weeks before this review, since it has a lot of things that could be improved and is an AWESOME idea.
[h2] What i like [/h2]
[olist]
    [*]The graphic part of the game is astonishing, with some fancy good visuals and a setting that quite obviously takes inspo in Cyberpunk 2077, but not as a bad thing at all.
    [*] The flying car level is a really good idea
    [*] The concept is really enjoyable and a really good starting point.
[/olist]

[h2] What i would upgrade/add [/h2]
[olist]
    [*]Controller support/wheel support
    [*]Car handling, right now is so easy to just drift the rear end of the car without analog inputs.
    [*]A way for the game to recognize when audio is being played from an app or even in general, so you dont have to manually put the songs in the files.
[/olist]
[h3] A bit more in depth comment and conclusions [/h3]
It is, again, a superb idea. But if you want to really make it enjoyable, you should add eventually things such as: controlling the traffic density, more car options for the same track, and what i mentioned earlier of the game detecting the songs automatically and the synth doing its thing in consequence since most people (myself included) dont have any music downloaded, we simply listen to it through streaming. Also, i would focus the aim of this game into something like Shutoko (a highway driving mod with traffic for assetto corsa) and its experience in a more arcade-ish way, if you manage to bring those cyberpunk vibes into something like that mod with controller and/or wheel support and tweaking a bit the car handling for it to be a bit more steady, i would stay for hours in here no doubt. 
I cant emphasize enough how good of an idea this is, and i would love to see the project if it is continued. But sadly, at this moment it is not the most enjoyable experience, though not horrible by any means, just needs some improvement.
All things considered, the possibilities are huge and hopefully I will be spending lots of hours into this game, thx for the effort devs.
P.S. This is just a nitpicky comment, but if this ever gets steam deck compatible with the controller that would be awesome as well, but since i dont know how easy/hard it is to do, I wont add it to the main comment.

Nice game to fidget with while on a zoom meeting and just let the rest of the departments chant BS to each other while you pretend to be paying attention to the screen also as its so simple you can still follow whats is been said just in case you get asked for input on a issue. Just make sure to mute the sound via your system volume mixer.

I do suggest that the Dev makes a music mute button as I couldn't seem to find one and had to mute via windows ""volume mixer""

25689,"Unlucky simulator
As far as my extremely poor understanding of math goes if you were to go all in every single round you would have a 1/67108864 chance of getting enough points to get the final sticker which is roughly a 0.000000014901% chance. Your odds may be slightly better then that. But only slightly.
So if on average 1 in every 30 players that play a game leave a steam review, and this game has 193 (194 if counting me) at the time of writing. Going by that math that means that 5,820 people played this game. This means that if every single player did 11,530.7 (well round up) 11,531 full runs (going all in over and over again until you bust is 1 run) at least 1 person will get it (because thats exactly how chance works). Considering the fact that each round takes roughly 5 seconds each (not counting how long the resets take because its not that far off) and there will be roughly 
33,554,432 games that are 1 round long
16,777,216 games that are 2 rounds long
8,388,608 games that are 3 rounds long

25699,"It's free which will make most of you even consider a ""game"" like this.

But... its surprisingly addicting to see the number go up or down. It seems to multiply and divide mostly by 2 but i think it varies sometimes too.

Gamble more, gamble less. Just get as high a number as you can.

Stupid little time waster, but it's still fun to see the number go up when you gamble a good portion of your points.

It's free and SUPER tiny file. If it's even a consideration for you, just try it lol",1
25700,"There is something going on behind the scenes, the game is not based of a random number generator, the outcomes happen with a heavy bias to either win or loose, there are constant streaks of either winning or loosing, up to ten or more continuous outcomes being same.  This honestly makes the game very not fun
you can press Q for stickers to appear on the screen",0
25701,"Just a warning. If you play this game, it can mess with your mind un poco. You will stare 1:1 odds in the face and say ""you are a 7:1."" 
Also the looping music and nature of betting can be funny.

One thing out of the way : are we sure its 50/50? I mean... I guess. It never seems like it though. Anyways. Great game if you want to get a perfect game for steamchievements. Fun game to play. Great for thinking about probability and turning odds to your favor. I mean, doubling on losses can be done anytime. as long as you have a 1, a 2, a 4, a 8, and so on even if your bets are weird, as long as you make the rule work it is fun to do. hell, say you pin bet results as + for a win and a - for a loss. You can change so many things up. This would work and doubling on loss : 1-, 1+, 1-, 2+, 2-, 4+. The way I see it, it works like this: You flip a coin eight times. You then select say flips 1, 5, 7, and 8. Each flip has a indepedent probabilities, but what is the chance they are all tails? the same as the chance for 1, 2, 3, and 4, to all be tails. As long as an understanding of odds is there, it aint luck. The whole process makes me think I am psychic, hence the game is quite funny to play. It reminds me of back when my friend got me into Honkai and I calcuted basic odds for qingze, probably the nichest character in the game. I am now realizing that this game would be great to teach probabilities with.",1

[b] 5050 [/b] is a casual, gambling game. 
[h3] STORY [/h3]
There is no story, background, or setup to the game.
[h3] GAMEPLAY[/h3]

The game allows you to keep your progress between play sessions, so if you wanted to play for a bit and come back to your balance it looks like you can.

The game is pretty easy and is only as hard as what your luck is. Play time for this game is ~30-60 minutes to get all achievements.
[h3] COMPLAINTS [/h3]
There is nothing specific to complain about for this game.
[h3] REPLAYABILITY [/h3]
There is no end game and you could continue to play forever if you wanted to.
[h3] RECOMMENDATION [/h3]
I would recommend this game to anyone that likes casual games or is an achievement hunter, and since it is free there is no reason not to have it.",1
25707,"More ethical than 100% and outright better than 99.9999999% of gacha games which, to be fair, are quite low bars to hit.

25711,"I genuinely hate this game

It gets your hopes up by giving you good luck in the beginning and when you reach to a high amount it just hits you with like a 7 lose streak and sending your points to the ground if not careful.

But somehow I keep going no matter the frustration...

Pretty fun game it's risk free gambling and you have a 2 to 1 payout at a 50 percent chance that's the best odds anywhere so it's pretty good for the endorphins to make bank and buy cute stickers. The dang song is so freaking catchy I'm insanely sure the creator wanted to get a 100 billion dollars stuck in anyone's brain who plays this game. The 1234 achievement can be pretty tricky if you suck at math as well. Definitely recommend for the price of free.",1
25735,"Something feels off about this. You can campaign in 1 state the whole game and still lose it. I have a feeling that every election is just RNG. I even tried pressing Next Turn every round without doing anything (did this on a few playthroughs) and somehow still won the election. With each election being RNG means every single achievement is also RNG.

Also all the reviews are fake. Everyone has barely any time played and only 1 review each, all with a 0 steam level. The one reviewer that has 6 reviews (4 of them are on this developers games ""Premier Buggy Racing Tour"", ""Roulette Simulator 2"", ""Roulette Simulator"", and ""2024 U.S. Election Simulator"").",0
25736,"Nothingburger. Played and tried, narrowly won. Played and did absolutely nothing, narrowly won. Absolutely do not buy this full price.",0
25737,"I enjoy the game, but some basic improvements in the election night coverage would go a long way:
- need the ability to see what the margins were in states called (not just the random sample displayed)
- need to see what the margins are prior to states being called
- need to see what % has been counted both prior to the call and afterwards
- ideally, display the county level data
Still, it's a niche market and props for making the game.",1
25738,"The best part of this game is simulating the results.  It's fun and exciting. 

The campaign is pretty average, you spend money in random states and unlock domestic policy options. 

There's definitely a strategy to it.  Fun to mess around with, and worth the price.

",1
25739,"I bought this looking for a strategy game where your actions matter, I FOUND a game where nothing matters. Everything is RNG. You can click and do all the events you want in a certain state and yet nothing really changes. Its basically a point and click where nothing matters and you get to sit through a FIVE MINUTE long thing at the end where it announces the winner of the game. The photos and the voice over instructions are all done by AI, which in my opinion is lazy. 

Overall this game is nowhere near worth 10$ maybe 2-3$ if you are lucky. Your choices do not matter the section at the end where results are announced is way too long. The photos are all done by AI. Just overall this does not seem like a product they put a lot of thought or attention into.

2/10 would not recommend.",0
25740,"I tested the game as a Democrat and Republican.  

Narrowly won as the Republican, and barely lost as the Democrat.

The game benefits from the simple menu options,  with different eras of the electoral college and different turnout options based on prior years elections.

Other reviewers had a couple of suggestions that I agree with too, however.

For example, Playing as an Independent Candidate.

I noticed the game has a factor option for how the third party candidates perform. That's a nice addition and it seems to work, however, there's no option to play as an Independent candidate.

If you choose to update this game, or release a new version,  you must add that option.  It will provide us with some form of replayability if we get tired of playing as the main parties. 

The policy selection options and campaign system is okay, it's a little underwhelming,  but it's simple enough for the average person to understand even if they're not into politics.

I would recommend this game but just be aware that future updates or versions have room for improvement. 

7.5/10 Review Score",1
25741,"This game is okay, but still leaves a lot to be desired. For those that are wondering, it works well on the Steamdeck & uses the tracking pads.

I'll get in to what I like:
* It is simplified & mostly easy to understand.
* On election night, you get to see the map as the results start to come in & it even has projected winners.

----------------------------------------------------------------

For a political simulator game it is very bare bones. Here's what could be added to improve it:

* Allow players to give their candidate & their opponent(s) names & not just select randomly generated names.
* While some basics on political issues are covered such as the economy, national defense, border security, & the environment, it is lacking in other areas. What about Constitutional issues (free speech, gun control, etc.)? Immigration? Repealing certain laws? What I mentioned just bare scratches the surface. 
* Allow players the option to create a custom third party, complete with custom party logo & determine their party's primary color ( for map tracking purposes).
* Allow players the option to play as a third party candidate. While it hasn't happened yet, its still a far off possibility. If you get enough people steamed at the two major parties, they have been know to throw their support behind a third party candidate.
* Allow players to completely customize the two major parties involved. Allow the option to determine what those parties will be & allow customization of their party logos & their party's main color (purple, yellow, green etc).
* When playing, allow the player to determine where their candidate's home state is. In elections, sometimes a home state can give a candidate an advantage.
* I like how you get to choose electoral maps from various years like 2000, 2012, & 2020. Would it be possible to include electoral maps every election year since 1952?
* Speaking of the electoral map, what about allowing a player to customize their own electoral map? Give players the option to determine toss up states, blue states, & red states (or gray states, orange states, & turquoise states) . Allow players to also determine the number of turns they have prior to the actual election.
* Between turns, have news updates on the player's progress & the opponent's progress (such as newspaper headlines, TV news reports (coverage of a campaign stop in a state), or interview. 

Like I said before, it you like a simple, easy-to-understand campaign simulator, this game is good for that. If you're expecting something with more details, then you'll be severely disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 5, I give the game a 2.",1

25751,"Looks very cool, however, you can't change controls, which is a shame if like me you're from a country where keyboards are not QWERTY (AZERTY in my case). Most of the games are therefore unplayable, it's pretty sad. I hope you'll allow players to set custom controls in a future update.",0

Retro-style all around, played with just WASD, space and for some games with a third key, it's utterly addictive. I yet have to play all the mini-games it has, but so far I've loved each one I've tried. I have to admit I added the 18+ free DLC, and it indeed gives a nice twist with just the right amount of spiciness.",1

25757,"Solace Inc. and Hellfire Pizza were really good games. Noirwood was okay, but holy hell trying to get the achievement for that one was difficult for me. Overall, pretty good collection of games.",1
25758,"This game is really creative and fascinating, it's a collection of simple indie games that are fast to play and intuitive. My favorite was cactorio but the other titles were really interesting as well. The game presents itself with a launcher from which you can choose from a good variety of new titles. I do think it doesn't get the recognition it deserves because all the games, even if small and quick to complete, feel really polished and well made.",1
25759,"While most of the games aren't for everyone, at least one of the games should be for someone.  Which is to say, if you play this compilation of small titles you will probably find at least one or two that you like.

For me, most of them didn't exactly pull me in.  And I encountered a glitch here and there that would cause to game a crash or need to be forced closed.  But I can definitely see a lot of talent here.  A lot of the games could use a bit of fine tuning IF they were to be made into full-sized games....but I don't really think that is the point.  These are small games that are being offered for free without the need for the developers to continue to dump tons of time into them with tweaks and fine tuning.

Keeping THAT in mind, this collection is fantastic.  Weld may not have clicked with me (for example), but I can recognize the interesting game concepts there.  The RNG of Terato Tamer may have turned me off of it, but the combination of steamy and horror isn't typically seen (especially in a turn-based RPG type game).  I liked the conversations in Reversary...and the fact that Terato Tamer seemed to connect to that in some ways was interesting.

All things said, I cannot see myself booting any of these games again.   But I've played enough games to see that there is a lot of talent and passion here, even for bite sized games with quirks.  I'd definitely recommend anyone give it a shot.",1
25760,"the author is an extremely rare and talented person, the collection is simply gorgeous, although I did not like all the games, the game about pizza delivery and dressing up liked perhaps the most, I hope the author will not abandon his project, I will look forward to new masterpieces ^^",1
25761,"This is difficult for me, on the one hand this game has a very good concept, it is a collection of clone games but with original characters of the same theme, they are quite games, but most of them are very bad, but there are a couple that I thought were good, If I had to rate those good ones separately, of course I would recommend them, but as a package for more than 80% of the games I wouldn't recommend them. The one I thought was the best of all and which I played for quite a few hours was the Vampire Survivors clone. There were also One that caught my attention is like a crazy taxi but you have to deliver pizzas, the bad thing is that no matter how many times I pressed the indicated keys I could never deliver a single pizza. First I'll talk about the good, visually it has a pretty good pixel art style, everything looks very good, the music and audio in general is adequate, it seems that the dev has done a good job. Now what I liked the least, now this is very subjective and maybe it doesn't bother you, but the first game I played was a clone of Five Nights at Freddy and maybe it's because of the generational gap, but I didn't like it at all, I didn't even understand what had to be done, I just wasted my time, and the same was with like 10 other games, plus they all have those kinds of cringe dirty se*ual bad jokes and dialogues like Fay Valentine from the live action cowboy bebop, therefore I wouldn't consider it appropriate for all ages, but don't be confused, this is not one of those hentai games that are for you to play with one hand, no, and maybe that's why it doesn't It is tagged as a game for adults, despite having an 18+ dlc that I did not try. Maybe it's just that I'm not the target this game is aimed at. but the vampire survivor clone is quite decent.",0
25762,"AploVVare Collection tries to simulate the feeling of having a Megadrive with a lot of cartridges to choose from (currently 23, they keep adding more and more). These cartridges are gamejam projects/short games the devs made and packed them in this neat little collection. Games can be hit or miss and often experimental but they're often charming enough to [b]not[/b] be just a prototype that must and should be forgotten because it's so raw it's barely anything.

The biggest highlight of the collection is the DLC that simulates the 32X; an addon for the Megadrive that basically attempted to ""upgrade"" the console so you didn't have to buy a new one. What does that DLC do? It adds +18 content to every game.... yeah...
the developer AploveStudio is quite horny and they don't hide it! The games themselves without the DLC can have some horny content, but most if not all of it is contained to the DLC. From simple nudity and sprite/art swaps to new synergies and effects and characters, the +18 DLC is by far the most relevant thing about this.

*I forgot to mention this and I don't know where to put it, AploveStudio's characters are all over AploVVare Collection, but it's fine if you haven't played any of their games. Hell, you might meet and know them this way a bit more easily.",1

25769,"This game is probably worth at least $5 in terms of value. It is a compilation of smaller games, packaged together in a fun old console style. The games vary in complexity and entertainment, and I have put 10 hours in without trying all the games yet. On top of all that, it's free!

25771,"Honestly, I don't understand the overwhelmingly positive reception of this game. For the most part, I failed to enjoy the game at all. I found issues with all 16 of the games, and enjoyed maybe 2 of them at best. 

WELD:
The game is way too vague and confusing with bad controls. I had no idea what I was doing for the majority of my time playing the game, and didn't enjoy it at all. Trying to manage your bars as well on top of all this and getting confusing tasks done, made it a very unpleasant experience.

Hellfire Pizza:
This is one of the few games that I actually liked. It's got an actual story, it's got comedy, and the gameplay isn't bad at all. I didn't really encounter any problems with it, and definitely enjoyed it. But it's very short and made up a very small percentage of my overall playtime of the games, so it's definitely not enough to salvage my opinion of this collection.

Malice Boutique:
While it isn't terrible, I found that there were countless times where I fulfilled what they asked for, but it simply wasn't enough. I tried combination after combination but just couldn't find the 5 star result for some of them, so definitely ruined my impression of the game. Not to mention, the game itself is just a bit stale in general and lacks content. 

Bloodsoil:
It's okay, but the controls feel very awkward, and the lack of diagonal movement made it very awkward. You also can't choose what your weapon chooses to target, so you could be trying to cut down the last plant, but it focuses on one of the zombies, and you lose because you were one hit away. 

Loveblade:
While the concept is unique, it isn't good. Very frustrating and boring gameplay, and there was no enjoyment I found from this game at all.

Noirwood:
 This game was unique, and seemed interesting, but it got very repetitive and frustrating very quickly. The wendigo enemies in the main game got way too fast and spawned in places that made it completely impossible to win if unlucky enough. The side game for the achievement was an absolutely miserable experience. I understand that's part of the point and the comedy of it, but it got so incredibly frustrating trying to deal with the game that It completely ruined this game for me.

Terator Tamer:
Easily the best of the 16, I had no issues with it, and it was the one I enjoyed the most. The problem is that a lot of the routes aren't complete and the game is just unfinished. Assuming it gets finished, it could be great, but I really don't think they plan on finishing it. 

Reversary: 
Honestly, when starting this review, I forgot about this one. This one was a gem. I really loved the visual novel aspect of it and while the actual gameplay was mediocre at best, I did enjoy this one.

Buckler:
This isn't fun. It's so ridiculously easy and you need to play through 10 matches in order to get the achievement. It was tedious, repetitive and boring

Something:
It was alright, I didn't really enjoy it, but I didn't particularly dislike it either. Probably just not for me.

Battery Acid:
Boring, overly easy and a tedious experience. I didn't enjoy anything about it, and finished it on my very first run. 

Chainlink:
I thought it was a cool experience, and then I realised that you spawn at the very beginning no matter where you die from. Made the experience way longer than it had to be and way too tedious, it should've been split into stages and you respawn at different points. 

Haulaway Joe:
The fighting mechanics were just terrible. Sometimes the skeleton attacks would be completely invisible, sometimes your attacks would just not do any damage. It was a buggy mess. 

Deadrounds:
Way too easy or way too difficult, short with a pretty bad storyline. Felt strongly like a waste of time

Clockwatch:
This game has no positives. It is legitimately one of the worst platformers I've played. It was excruciating and I don't wish playing this on anyone. 

Cactorio:
The game lags way too easily, and cannot stand more than maybe 100 cactus being farmed at one time, and that's being generous. Despite this, the achievement requires you to plant 1,000 cactus, 10x the amount that the game can even handle. An absolute laggy mess.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While there's definitely a few games in here that could be worth playing, the overall collection isn't. I enjoyed the way they tied different games' stories together and how well they connected, but that was about it. I cannot recommend this game, it was too tedious to play through.",0

WELD: I hate this game. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing and I can‚Äôt figure out the controls even when the instructions are in front of my face. It sucks

Hellfire Pizza: Simple pizza delivery game.Takes a while to know what slows you down. Don‚Äôt know why it has an 18+patch since it‚Äôs just one scene of the protagonist not wearing pants and it doesn‚Äôt lead to any sex.

Malice Boutique: Just a dress up game with what I believe are some of this guy‚Äôs OCs.

Loveblade: A good little Bullet Hell which wasn‚Äôt too frustrating. Though I do lose where I am since I‚Äôm the dot and not the sword.

Cirti Plays Noirwood: Okay little treasure hunt with a monster chasing you. There is also a secret game hidden somewhere which would have been neat if the streamer chat didn‚Äôt get in the way.

Terato Tamer: Understand why this one has adult content. Was never a fan of luck base gameplay.

Reversary: It is a nice little story of a player and boss chatting before they fight. I do think the controls are kind of stiff.

Buckler 3: Don‚Äôt really care for this little strategy game. Just played it for the achievement

Something: Pretty cool. Sure, there‚Äôs no real threat at the start since you are the big bad monster. But as other monsters get released, you have to be more aware on whats around you.

Battery Acid: the fast gameplay can make this game very hard unless you find the laser that one-shots everything including bosses

Haul Away Joe: Short and okay. Don‚Äôt really like the camera or the FOV.

Dead Rounds 213X: Enjoyable and short. Once you get another weapon the zombies fall like flies.

Cactorio!: Okay game where you plant cactus and stuff to make planet cactuses easier while dealing with bandits. Though it can be a bit boring

One Escape from Franky‚Äôs: Not really that good. Wasn‚Äôt that clear on what you're supposed to be doing.

Solace Inc.: Pretty alright. your player can‚Äôt do much but you can hire some guys to help so you can start killing enemies. Start with some heavy fighters so you can actually hurt things and then get some support or backup and you should be set for every level.

There She Is!: Just a ‚Äòspot the correct person‚Äô minigame.

Cthulhu Merge: One of those drop merge games I‚Äôve been seeing a lot lately. It‚Äôs fine.

Wibbly Adventure: I get that this is a Kirby ripoff with more blood but why does feel so bad to play with the jumping and enemies one shotting you and you don‚Äôt even have that floating jump. I don‚Äôt even like 2D Kirby and I‚Äôll rather play that than this.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]Monstronomy[/b] is a monster-taming game with some gruesome lore beneath it. You'll see some jumpscares and videos that are unrelated to the game as you play, which tell about something else that went behind the scenes.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 101 monsters to catch
- Secrets to discover

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Slow combat
- Lack of QoL fixes
- Long backtracking inside building areas

[b]Specs[/b]
Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b]
[i]The game lacks several QoL fixes and feels pretty much barebones, plus it doesn't use its strength for puzzle solving well.[/i]

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The game looks like a watered-down [b]Pok√©mon[/b] game, especially on the battle screen. On the good side, the monsters all look great and diverse - there were cute ones as well as the scary ones mixed in. Also, the evolutions give some sort of resemblance to their prior forms while still showcasing new features.

However, the edited videos need some work, especially on the text. Some text can be hard to see, and I'm not even talking about the ones that were made intentionally hard to see. Some of them used colors that either didn't mesh well with the background or were too dark, and the font sometimes didn't match the video. As for the content itself, it hardly shows anything of value and tends to be repeated from the ones already shown.

[h3]Story[/h3]
[b]Monstronomy[/b] is a dark take on the [b]Pok√©mon[/b] game. It starts just like any other [b]Pok√©mon[/b] game where you have to pick your starter and go on an adventure. Then you'll quickly realize that something was wrong. The game wasn't subtle in showing these secrets and urges you to find out. You are supposed to figure out what happened on your own, although it shouldn't be hard to figure out a glimpse of what's going on as long as you pay attention.

The postgame is where you'll mostly figure out everything. Sure, you might be able to access some content before finishing the game, but you might have to do it several times if you do it that way. You are supposed to gather clues from the videos and dialogues in the game, which you can use to do some tinkering on your own. However, I was kinda disappointed with how it turned out. It wasn't as scary as I thought; the worst of it is just some intended inhumane experiment. I was hoping for some creepypasta within them all, but it never shows up. Heck, I even wondered what the use of the jumpscare and the scary atmosphere in those videos is if it's being like this.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3228622966 

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
Just like [b]Pok√©mon[/b], you have to explore the map and capture some monsters. The monsters are varied, but resources are limited. You'll have issues finding enough money to catch the monsters at first, especially if you don't want to sell anything. This will be rectified after you finish the game, although I wished that it wasn't made as scarce in the beginning.

I liked how the game made use of status and stats modifiers. Both of those skills seem to be the best in this game - you'll have a hard time defeating a monster that raises its defense stat a few times, and some status ailments can permanently stun you if done right. However, that also means that strategy will be limited to one tactic, which is used by different monsters with different typing to cover the weakness and resistance chart. This also makes some monsters seem to be better than others, especially if they have access to these skills easily.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3228620308 

Fights are boring. You can't speed them up, so you have to wait for the slow animation to finish. This is made worse when your character leveled up - the exp gain sound and delay will be repeated twice, meaning that you have to wait twice as long until the fight ends. The thing is, the game never differentiates the length whenever you get a huge or low exp, and this also applies to when enemies' HP is depleted.

On the plus side, I like how the evolution works. All end-game evolution grants a secondary typing, and once you get a certain item, you can switch between the two and learn moves from both evolutions. This expands the monster capability as well as the move coverage, especially when faced with enemies that give you a disadvantage.

Despite the numerous puzzles, some of them feel bland. They tend to be similar in nature, forcing you to input combinations based on the given hints. Well, the method of acquiring the combination may be different, and it sometimes can be too vague to figure out. The ARG puzzle that requires you to browse in the real world was clever, although the next steps can be too confusing to figure out on your own.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3228619675¬†

[b]Monstronomy[/b] is a game where you have to take notes, figuring out the story based on the given hints which sometimes might lead to secrets. However, the game doesn't seem to make use of this strength - there aren't many puzzles that were made like this, and the ones that do barely reward you with anything. I know that you will learn more of the truth in some of them, but I wish there were more than that.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished everything in 23.5h. You can finish it faster if you want; I was taking my time and collecting all the monsters with their evolutions, which took a lot of time to do. The game isn't difficult to beat. You can just grind to bypass any difficulty. The one that can be challenging is to beat the post content, but even that will only be difficult if you don't have a lot of high-level monsters.

The game has 2 endings, but there aren't many differences between them and you can see them both by saving before the final boss.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Monstronomy[/b] is a unique game. It feels like those creepypasta games that will try to give you the creeps as you play, except that they didn't deliver. As you continue playing, the creepiness is just gone and replaced with puzzles and secrets. It might be interesting to figure out what happened, but the game doesn't use much of this strength.

In my opinion, the game was lacking several QoL fixes; the monster-taming game feels barebones with its simplistic strategy, the UI is too simple and too similar to [b]Pok√©mon[/b], and there was a lot of backtracking needed when you are inside areas with a lot of enemies. Not to mention that all enemies are the same. I know it's being like that because of the theme, but I wish there were some differences, including more of the in-game plot instead of the ""endless"" fighting and random videos popping left and right. I wish I could recommend it, but I realized that I wasn't feeling much when I played this game, and the battle's slow pace irritated me in the end.

25798,"I have put 39 hours into this game and these are my thoughts.

-The horror adult theme is wonderful.
-Monster Collecting is fantastic.
-Story is immersive.
-Puzzles were SO damn GOOD!
-Dev team is very interactive with players.
-Any bugs are fixed immediately.

This game and Dolphin Horizon Studio prove that you don't need to be a Triple A game company to make a great game. If anything Small gaming studios have brought us brilliant games lately and Monstronomy is on that list. I sincerely hope this team keeps making games or even a sequel. It was an F'ing blast to work with others in discord to solve the puzzles in this game. 

Rating: 9.5/10. Brilliant Game. Brilliant Team.

Please play this game.",1
25799,"A monster collector style RPG with an ARG underneath it all. As a first game, this is a really awesome way to start out! The mysteries are fun to solve and the monster designs range from wonderfully grotesque to oddly adorable.  There are a few players gathered together trying to uncover the rest of the game and a very illusive final monster, which really brings me back to when games had a real sense of discovery. Get it and support these folks! 

EDIT: 100% the game! Wild ride solving the ARG. Thank you devs for making this experience, something very special in this game. EEELOOONNN!!!",1
25800,"Kinda juxtaposes oldschool Pokemon style with found footage horror to really make creepy things hit home. I'm pretty bad with jumpscares myself, but found the jumpscares to not be too outrageous, so this is really good if you like spooky horror but have trouble with surprises. They also did good work on making the monsters likable but fitting to the creepy tone.

Artstyle: Good.
Combat: Serviceable pokemon-like. Good level curve.
Plot: Damn creepy.",1
25801,"Right now, I can't recommend the game.
This is primarily because the game has crashed multiple times on me, losing an hour or two of gameplay each time. It's tough to want to speak highly of a game that I have to be defensive against in order to even play it at all. Especially when I'm using a brand new PC with some of the absolutely highest end pieces of hardware availible.

I love the idea of a pokemon game with a twist, which I've put 10 hours into, and so far so good, despite the corny videos, which aren't very convincing in any real way, but I think I would be excited to play this through the rest of the way to see how it goes, but at this point, It's a no from me.",0
25802,Amazing game. The atmosphere is brilliant and the mysteries are fun to solve. It gives a feeling most other games can't achieve.,1

really interesting pokemon clone the story so far is pretty intriguing and I love the real footage that they put throughout the game. I haven't completed it yet so I'll update the review as I go, but definitely one of the better pokemon type games I've played on steam already.

Edit: Overall still really enjoyed the game after finishing I do wish there was a few less battles though I honestly enjoyed the video tapes/plot the most, but by the time I got to the end for at least me there's definitely more secrets I was a bit burnt out and my monster got to the point where he could pretty much solo everything by the end so it was kind of just a time sink to do battles. Definitely recommend saving when you get to the blue peak or plateau or whatever it was called the place on route 3 as the ""final"" Boss has multiple endings.",1
25804,"This review is spoiler free.

I can only recommend this game to  those who enjoy diving deep into a shallow pool. There are plenty of hidden mysteries and files that make for a solid ARG experience, but I can't say this game will blow anyone away from a narrative perspective even once the cat is out of the bag.

What really drags this game down however is the overly simplistic mon collection and battling portions. The system is very bare bones, the monster designs while well done are surprisingly dull, and unless you want to challenge yourself you can beat the entire game with a single mon. The final stretch of the game was a slog against goons with very little in the way of diverse teams or challenge. They also lack a unified 'theme' which takes away the charm evil groups in games like the Pokemon series gives.

If you are looking for a ARG style experience there are worse ways to spend a few hours, but as a game I cannot recommend this at full price.",0
25805,"""What happened to you mom?""

If you consider buying Monstronomy expecting a monster-tamer game you are right. And you are wrong at the same time. The game has a lot of things, you will be familiar with. And at the same time, Monstronomy throws a lot of strange at you, right from the beginning. In order to showcase this, I will give you a summarization of the first 5-10 minutes. You start at a desktop. Files & folders are there, you can click through. Most important are the controls-file as well as the Downloads-Folder where you find and can start the actual game you expected. So you start the Monstronomy file inside Monstronomy. You wake up in your room and go downstairs where your mother tells you to feed your monster. You go to a chest in the garden where you can choose your starter. You have the choice between an Order-, Chaos- or Demon-type monster. You return to the house, your mother lying on the gorund, blood everywhere. Dead. You leave the house, dead people and monster everywhere and your first fight against a cultist. Here starts your quest for revenge.

The monster-tamer game is quite solid. I absolutely love the different monsters and their design. The choice of two final evolution forms for every monster is a really neet idea and later on, you can even switch constantly between the two. The strengths and weaknesses are well balanced as well as the whole game. You level fast, and in each fight, the whole group gains experiences. Overall balance is also okay. The game isn't really difficult but you have to pay a bit attention or go back healing. You can catch new monsters with chests and in the end-game there are even ""legendaries"". The attack-design I would consider on the weaker part though. You do not have move limitations but stronger attacks have lower accuracy trying to cancel it out. Overall, the gameplay is not as complex or deep as the most well-known competitor but it is functional and shines especially in the monster design.

Though, weird as it is - the game and the situation - Monstronomy shines the most in the moments it isn't a monster-tamer game. The story alone is already unusual. But it only gets weirder and at one point you find yourself intrigued. Trying to understand what is really happening here. Inside the Monstronomy game world a lot of - let's say disturbing - videos are scattered around. Often you find them on TVs, sometimes on random objects and sometimes they are unavidable during story events. Aside from the videos, you notice that NPCs start behaving weirder and weirder and across the game world, you have green and sometimes even red texts. Certain names reappear over and over again. Progressing in the story, also unlocks new files on the Desktop (where you start the game) although locked by passwords. All of this creates a great mystery, you might want to solve. I wouldn't call Monstronomy a horror game but disturbing on certain levels. And in the end-game I would call Monstronomy even a puzzle game where you try to solve the games puzzles & mysteries. You will try to find the ""legendaries"", trying to figure out the real story, trying to unlock the desktop files. All of this comes together in one fulminant ARG, leading you temporarily even outside the game. And while there exists a guide, telling you how to solve most of it, I would implore you dear potential buyer, to try figuring out all of this stuff by yourself first as it makes for a far better experience.

The games also has music which I am undecided on. It is only a few tracks and most of the time, you hear this happy-to-lucky overworld tune which doesn't really fit. On the other hand this discrepancy may be well intended. From the technical side, I have encountered one ""critical"" bug where the stops working after certain attacks during fighting and does not react anymore. I am not exactly sure what causes it but it happened most often for me with Wind-type attacks causing a status effect. So, saving often is recommanded to reduce frustration. Futrehmore, the game's movement feels kinda choppy. The game has also achievements which need you to solve most of the game's mysteries. The main story itself probably takes around 6-10 hours. If you go for the post-game endgame content, you can add another 5-10 hours if you try it for yourself. Less if you use a lot of help.

If all of this sounds interesting to you then [strike] apply for Project Dreamcatcher today [/strike] consider buying the game. If you have more questions, leave a comment and I'll try to come back to it.",1

25810,"I'm going to write a more detailed review later, but oh my god, this is what child me obsessed with edgy romhacks dreamed of. An actual, well-done, well-sprited, *fun* Pokemon horror game, where you can catch and tame the 'horrifying' monsters instead of only fighting them. 

The ARG elements were such a fun twist, the battle mechanics are surprisingly deep, the two final evolution paths for each monster opened up so many opportunities for teambuilding, and the designs are absolutely my favorite part - genuinely so creative and gorgeous. 

SPOILERS of some of my current favorites, for people who want to go in completely blind: [spoiler] An anglerfish that evolves into two different deep-sea sharks, a horrifying pile of dead meat and skulls who acts like a big puppy, a tragedy/comedy split evolution, a cordyceps deer, an origami mouse that becomes other origami animals, Gun, a UFO monster with very fun evos referencing old horror movies, a stickbug made of bamboo called [i] Bamboozler, [/i] he's perfect [/spoiler]

 (I had a team of rotating monsters for the whole game, NON-STORY SPOILER: [spoiler] The Pocketwatch item that lets you switch between the final evolutions at will is insanely fun, letting you adjust your team's typings on the fly to cover whatever weaknesses you might have! The move relearner letting you learn the moves of both evo lines opens up so much customizability in different sets and coverage! Digimon-esque, I loved it there and I love it here. [/spoiler])  

Monstronomy is fun, spooky, genuine, earnest, and I love it so so much. This isn't even going into the actual plot, I just reached the postgame and there's still so much left to see.

25834,"Loved the retro-style of the game. Momo is a very cute and charismatic character! It takes me back to the classic 8-bit and 16-bit era.

The music is very catchy and fits the game perfectly. The sound effects reflect the game's art style, including touches of other sounds and 8-bit sounds that blend well.

It's a challenging game that engages you to learn the right way to pass each stage, offering a rewarding learning process. I loved the retro filter option; it looks like you're playing on a good quality CRT.

Amazing game. Recommend!",1
25835,"Short precision platformer with exaggerated playtime due to frustrating bosses.

You take the role of a miner mole who has to go check out what‚Äôs going on in the mine. Since this is similar to old-school platformers, there‚Äôs no story as you progress though the game. 

There are only four ""chapter"" in the game, each with ten stages. A chapter is simply a cave setting with a different color scheme and a new mechanic. For example, in one, the surfaces are slippery. The next world has its own mechanic and retains everything from the previous ones.

A stage is single-screen platforming challenges that can be finished in less than a minute. It‚Äôs very fair because it also involves one checkpoint so you don‚Äôt have to restart from the beginning after each death. Some stages have a collectible matchstick that requires a bit more effort. 

The focus is on gameplay. Despite the adorable and nostalgic pixel graphics, the game requires a certain amount of precision platforming. It doesn't go overboard with the difficulty, but the difference between making the jump and colliding with a threat is generally hidden in a fraction of second.

The mole is not a warrior or a hardy creature, so even a single contact with something dangerous can kill him. However, he possesses a very useful ability that he may use in a variety of scenarios. Regardless of the surface, he can always dig into the ground to avoid enemies or tight spaces. What I don't like is a slight hop when you come out of the hole.

However, because this is a platformer, you will be unable to progress without the leap. It has a respectable height, but you'll need to get used to the double-jump mechanism, which involves jumping first and then quickly pressing the dig button. 

This move is essential in boss fights. Well, it‚Äôs not actually a fight because all you need to do is dodge the boss‚Äô attack patterns until it becomes bored. But while normal stages are decent, boss fights are frustrating because they constantly increase their attack speed and force you to restart the entire thing if you take a hit. Due to constant dying, they will take longer to beat than all the normal stages combined.",1
25836,"Momo and the Mine stands out as a great precision platformer that offers an enjoyable experience. The character Momo, along with the art style and the retro-inspired screen display, transports players back to the nostalgic era of 8-bit and 16-bit consoles, engaging the gameplay from the start.

The gameplay itself is both fun and rewarding, challenging you to master each stage with the right strategy and timing. The music and sound effects enhance this immersive experience, representing tones of the 8-bit era, in addition to have addictive melodies. 

Totally recommended",1
25837,"""Momo and the Mine"" is a fun precision platformer with a cute mole to play as! There is also a retro filter that you can turn on and off while you are on the menu. The graphics will touch the hearts of everyone liking 8-bit games! The levels are well designed and require tight controlling. Our mole is capable of that! And with his cute technics he will manage to light yet another lamp, progress the levels and beat the bosses! The soundtrack was equally fun as were the menu options and layout as well (you'll understand when you launch it).

At the time of writing, you can't remap the buttons and they aren't so convenient but you can get used to them. That's an option that should definitely be added. It will probably play better with a controller. The jump doesn't always feel 100% steady but it won't be a big problem in passing the stages.

For this price, it's a must try! It's a good game and a lot of fun! Quite memorable as well.. Who can resist such a cute little mole?.. ^^

25839,"A fun game with tight controls, cute graphics and great soundtrack. And some *very* hard bosses. It's short too, so pick it up and play it. Recommended!

Tip: holding the double jump button will make you dig if you touch the ground and are still holding it. So when you release it, you will do a little hop again. Be mindful of that if you don't understand what's happening! Once you master this you're going to breeze through the levels.",1

25842,"A mostly charming NES inspired platformer... BUT THERE IS ONE BIG ISSUE I HAVE WITH IT.


Just got done playing this the other day, and it was a decent time waster. The graphics and music pretty much nail that retro 8-Bit Goodness, and I like the one-room approach to levels they make for some brief yet satisfying challenges (and they can get pretty tricky later on). Also having a playable title screen and options menu is a neat touch, I like that!

Our hero has a Unique moveset... one that takes some getting used to, I'll admit. The game makes use out of your required abilities, and even tests your knowledge of what this mole can do by the end-certain sections were a lot easier once I remembered that ""Burrowing"" is pretty much your RUN button. Though I'm not a fan of popping out of the ground and needing a moment to land before you can properly jump again, but other than that, the rest seems doable.


On paper, a game like this should take an hour or so to beat, tho you may notice I have 3.8 hrs on record at the time of me writing this, and most of THAT was spend going against the BOSSES.

There are four bosses in total-one for each world-and while the first and fourth were decent if mildly frustrating chase sequences, the second and third boss are TEDIOUS beyond belief. You don't have attacks in this game, so you're expected to wait through several minutes worth of dodging stuff before the game can let you proceed... And if at any point you choke towards the end of the fight, or the boss does something Sneaky that you weren't prepared for, you're doing it all over again!

I could easily go in detail on JUST how much I didn't like the third boss in particular, but for now... here's my recommended improvement: CHECKPOINTS. These Boss fights would be A LOT LESS PAINFUL if the player could at least SKIP the first couple waves of attacks upon respawn. The first and fourth bosses had checkpoints, so I don't see why the others cannot have them.


WITH ALL OF THAT SAID... Even though the bosses aren't very fun, the levels still are which is why I'm still going to give this game a positive recommendation at the end of the day. Talent clearly went into this, and I'm curious to see what the future holds for Tamboril. If ONLY the bosses can be improved somehow, I can see this going from a 3/5 Game to a 4/5, but you can still do worse for the price.",1
25843,"Very nice game ,touch and feel  let you enjoy the game more, realy fun to play .",1
25844,"For the price of one snack you get a super short, but really solid piece of platforming inspired by both modern precision platformers and the slightly unfair late 2000s ""I Wanna Be The Guy"" trend. An evening well spent.",1

25850,"[h1]This game skips too much![/h1]


Practically every chapter ends just when things are getting interesting, and the start of the next chapter is always a time-skip with a couple pages of explanation as to what happened in the intervening year(s). You don't get to experience things with your character for the first time - you're always thrown in the middle/near the end of events.

First day of Y«íngsh√¨ school? Nope, you go from discovering you're a Y«íngsh√¨ at the end of chapter 1 to being a student about to graduate at the start of chapter 2. Final exam? No matter what you do your rival has you dead to rights and... the next chapter starts, 3 years later, with your character ruminating about how you somehow got out of that very unwinnable situation and barely beat out your rival in a no doubt impressive turn of events that everyone thought was super cool.

Something exciting happening? Better skip ahead a few years, nothing's more exciting than the ending or being told about it after it's already happened!

Also, the romances are just a checkbox. You barely spend any time with these characters and your only option to express any romantic interest is after interacting with them - interactions that don't even have a lick of romantic interest/flirting mind - and choose the choice that says ""they are everything I want in a lover. We are soul-mates. I am crushing so hard"". I'm not even exaggerating, that's how intensely written the ""romance please"" options are, which make no sense for how little we interact with them. I just want my character to show a mild interest or maybe open to the idea of that character making a move... [strike]but God forbid any on these games have characters that show romantic interest in the player without having to actively pursue them.[/strike]

All that said, it's not [i]bad[/i]. It's written well, as far as I can tell (I am a troglodyte so YMMV). It just feels incomplete not only because of how much is skipped, but [i]what[/i] is skipped. In my opinion, the most interesting parts of the story are missing, and that's a shame.

(Also, my time played isn't an accurate representation of how long the game is. I just kind of left it running in the background (even when writing this review. Because I'm dumb.))",0
25851,"This game can be broken down into 2 halves.

I did not enjoy the first half much and would give it 5 out of 10. Choices are abundant, but barely affect anything plot-wise. I also found romances lacking. The game just throws 6 potential romantic interests in a row at you one after the other and prompts the player to express their interest (or lack there of) on the spot after a couple interactions and... thats it, you won't meet them again until the second half.

The game redeems itself with the second half where player choices start to truly matter and the story picks up. I would give it 7 out of 10.  And hence the ""thumbs up"".

While I've enjoyed the game overall, the first half could've been better.",1
25852,"It started off interesting and I wanted to see where it went, so I tried just going with it and letting it do its thing. However that turned into giving it passes which turned into disinterest, then calling it quits.

It's a good concept but it's heavily expositional and too fast-paced. I know it's hard to fit a huge timespan into a single game but it goes by in such big chunks while basically just telling you what's happening in detail, often in dialogue, that it feels like the game is passing you by. This lead to very simplified choices as well where you get one chance to choose a path- like which general to support or who to romance- and then that's just set in motion and you watch it play out almost without you. Aside from these major story-altering choices that come up your choices seem superficial.

And it's not just the setup phase either. I quit at the discovery of the second crane almost three hours in. It fell victim to [i]all[/i] the above flaws. I expected a challenger and the crane patron spirit had been talked up so much only for the main character to find another kid like them and go ""Whoa, another crane! That's crazy!"" and then it's just accepted on like one piece of evidence that ""yeah there's two now actually"" and then you're moving forward again.

I think the idea was just overly ambitious. This game's full potential doesn't fit in one game, or maybe just didn't fit in the timeframe the writers were working with.",0
25853,"This is a really well-writen IF (Interactive Fiction) that definitely deserves some more love! The story's pretty captivating from the very beginning and, while there were some... weaker moments (looking at you chap. 4), it really picks up around chapter 5.

Some pretty significant parts of the game (including a whole chapter) are pretty much open for you to choose and do whatever might compel you, be it boosting your own standing in court, assisting the military, or even the emperor himself. Your choices are also [i]really[/i] important - supporting certain characters in chapter 3 and 5 will (indirectly) bring far-reaching consequences up to the preparations for the final battle.

Hell, even your origin story (like whether your character was born in nobility or not) is relevant in most chapters. Take that, Cyberpunk.

Fights were engaging and not too challenging, though I wish a few stat checks were less demanding. I'm sorry, I'll never agree with using personality stats as a skill. My character made a quick joke two pages ago and now she's precisely 1% less Serious‚Ñ¢, so she'll fail this next check and have a scar for life :(

Jokes aside, like others have said, Tale of Two Cranes does suffer from an unfortunate case of having just enough to create a very compelling and interesting narrative, but not fully dedicating enough time and depth to all of its arcs. Almost every chapter starts with a two- to five-year timeskip - there's nothing necessarily [i]wrong[/i] with that, of course, but it does skip through very intriguing moments right to their resolutions.

All that to say I often found myself a bit disconnected from my character and the current plot, as I didn't see most of the events unfolding. The writers did manage to do a good job at describing these past events after the facts, yet... I still wish I had actively participated in the full-on wars we missed out on. It's still a REALLY long game, so I understand why they couldn't reasonably spend too much time fleshing out every single conflict.

This also applies to romance and more importantly to the characters themselves. While I liked most of their introductions, the protagonist's main party didn't develop much at all through the story (with one exception which I'll mention later). Also, the game really insisted in only ever allowing the player to talk to up to 3 characters during ""free roam"" sequences, so, yeah, I never chose to actively interact with a few of the more standoffish characters, as my character would reasonably have a preference to spend time with her spouse, best friend, master, and/or family. That made it so that most moments of camaraderie, such as when your friends would gather to party or celebrate victory, felt a bit... empty?

""Here ya go, you won the war! Time to celebrate and see how the others are feeling!""
[Interacts with a single character].
""Welp, that was fun! You'll see them again three years from now.""

Big spoiler warning here: [spoiler]The Other Crane is definitely the most important NPC and I wish he had a bit more time to fully develop. He's a major character in chapter 3 and 4, but he suddenly turns into a side character like most others up until chapter 6. Everything that happens following that caused a bit of whiplash, even if I expected it beforehand, to the point where the title Tale of Two Cranes felt almost ill-fitting before then.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]Kinda reminded me of Revenge of the Sith? I guess???[/spoiler]

While I wish we had more ""personal"" quests and interactions with the companions, I still had fun with the latter half of the romances. Stakes are high and the characters are pretty realistic about it. You didn't hear it from me, but a few scenes did make me tear up a bit... Chapter 5 and 6 also let you spend a bit more time with characters by selecting them to help you with your own goals, which is neat! Just wish we saw a bit more of the opposite too.

Finally, the last two chapters were awesome. I wanted the final choice to detail its consequences a [i]bit[/i] more, as my character completely changed a few, uh, important things, but I'm alright with it.

Overall, I think the plot would've benefited if it was split into two or three parts/games, each fleshing out its wars and such (big spoilers: [spoiler]so Tale of Two Lords, Tale of Two Empires, and Tale of Two Cranes[/spoiler]), but it's still a great story as it is. I had fun and I'd recommend it for anyone interested in Ancient China or other IFs such as The War for the West.

TL;DR: It's great! just wish it was more fleshed out. 9/10 :3",1
25854,"First, the positives: The writing is good, the epilogue is lengthy, and it's an interesting setting.

The bad: Many choices are presented that lead to bad outcomes not because of a skill check failure but because the choice itself was misleading. E.g. when choosing how to prosecute a war, if you select the option that is basically to exercise caution and surgical strikes, the *actual* choice and way it is perceived is cowardice.

The story is much more on rails than most CoG stories.

It leans far more into ""game"" than ""story.""

The ROs are bland and you have too few interactions with them.

I lost count of how many situations are lose-lose no matter what you do. Going back and altering save files to maximize skills, alter personality traits, and increase relationship scores - in many situations, none of this will alter key outcomes. This is forgivable with situations like when a particular lord is killed while you are away, but I can't fucking stand it when it's something like failing to persuade someone or getting your ass kicked in single combat. Why even present the reader with the the illusion of choice, the illusion that you have any control? Anytime interactive fiction titles pull that, I view it as the author expressing contempt for the audience.

The vast majority of the story is also barely about the central conflict. It comes up at the very end as a sudden betrayal by a character I'd disliked from the moment they were introduced.

My playtime is crazy long because there were several times when I got so irritated that I just walked away from my laptop without bothering to close the game.

The writing here, in terms of prose alone, is good, the setting and the overall plot are a solid backbone to build a story off of. But the execution is lacking. There's a whole entire mechanic around building up your estate and deciding what to do with it, but it is only tangentially relevant to the plot and you never get any sense of connection to it. I feel almost like the authors were inspired by Lords of Infinity, but didn't pick up on the fact that that was the third title in the series and is explicitly structured as being part of a buildup that will pay off in future books.

I really wanted to give this one a positive review, but I think the simplest indicator to me that I wasn't enjoying myself was seeing how many tabs in my text editor I had open with prior save states to revert choices because I realized that a seemingly innocuous option selected previously had led to some stupid outcome that wasn't even slightly hinted at when the choice was made. When I start making more and more checkpoints for myself to go back, the entire exercise becomes less and less about immersion and enjoyment and more about frustration that the poor structure and deceptive choices are breaking up the flow.",0
25855,"As one who loves stories such as these, this one went from interesting enough at the start and ended with something that couldn't be called lackluster at best

The main issue wasn't a dozen paper thin characters or a dozen stats that did next to nothing, choices where if you didn't pick the ""correct"" stats to spec into you would be doomed to fail (IE: 3 choices and all of them using your lowest stats out of a possible **4** stats) or even that those stats degrade or raise for no apparent reason but rather the uncountable number of times wrong events would trigger; be they the low/neutral/high relationship value dialogue showing up right after the others, making a choice and it acting like i didn't or in a particularly noticeable time acting like i picked one when i didn't or just flat out not flagging. As stated in another review it's a constant ""build up, time skip, resolution while talking about what happened in the time skip"", but i'd rather focus on another part, that being the character you play as, they are erratic and hardly in line with at least how i was playing; it makes total sense that a stoic, noble and forgiving character would be yelling and making rash choices about an order that they *know* to be a lie or something they just wouldn't care about which bring me to the ""classes"" and not just that calling them that feels *off*; one can detect lies which you'd *think* is helpful but it's mainly just flavor much like your other powers (at least if you pick strategist) or the crane which does nothing but tell you to stop interacting with it

I wasn't going to write a review but then i finished the game and got perhaps the biggest slap in the face ""everything you did didn't matter"" ending even though i was not only well liked by named characters but groups such as the army and court; as i sit here writing this i *want* to say something at least decent about it but,

TLDR: it tries to do too many things at once, has too many characters, doesn't expect you *not* liking some characters, keeps teasing the idea of you *doing* anything, gives options where you might just have no chance to pass, bugged flag and skips around so much that nothing feels like it matters since the next page could be years in the future which makes the sudden events at the end feel even cheaper",0
25856,"Despite the wonderful and indept writing i am not happy with this game.

Why?

Because every Chapter you are send out to accomplish something, get no choice in it, have to cater to the court even when your character woudlnt want to, making a loyal charater the only thing that can be played resonably and then!

The game throws a massiv curveball, everything changes, your efforts are negated regardles of stats and then comes a three year timeskip.

25857,A long-going tale with plenty of decisions both big and small to make. While the jumping of years took a bit of getting used to the overall intrigue of the plot made up for it.

There is one twist at the end which I definitly didn't see it coming but at least I can say that ending was still to my liking. The thing which I didn't really understanded was adding money at this game. Could be even better if we could spend them. I think at the whole day I spend around 2k where I had about 7k at the end? Could be nice if we could recruit our own troops which technically is mentioned but I didn't have that possibility during my playthrough.

25867,"It was kinda hard to give this a not so good review, I love 616 games and played most of their games. I love the fact that they're slowly moving away from the psx style horror games, it's great to see an indie developer evolve and improve. 
They did great with ""I am a serial killer"" however, stab, feels off. It feels like it has different objectives just to have them, yes, I didn't spend much time with the game, but it didn't intrigue me as much as their previous titles.

regardless, I'd say give it a shot if you like games like Granny where you need to figure out how to get out, although the controls are a little awkward, you may have fun. If you're looking to get scared, this won't do it for you.

25890,Fantastic game. Challenging levels and so many.,1
25891,"The Monkey King is probably one of the absolute best hero skins, but as with all hero skins before, it suffers from the exact same problems.
The customization is limited, with only two of the three colors in available palettes being used and placed a bit strangely.
Monkey Kings fur is also very bright and washed out, making an all red or all black Monkey King isn't possible, as red becomes almost pink and black becomes greyish, meaning that your options to look unique with the character will be difficult.

The skin isn't worth the price, how I would make the offer more enticing for a customer:
Include the Event Exclusive ""Ruyi Jingu Bang"" execution that came out the same time as the skin, add an Exclusive Emblem Editor Symbol that resembles the Monkey King.
This would make the offer of buying the skin with money more appealing and justify the higher price. I would want more such as unique voice lines, but based on what can and cannot be done, the execution would be the easiest to do.

You'll get more from the Hero Offers (Warmonger, Gryphon, Kyoshin, Pirate, Medjay, Afeera, Ocelotl) that gives you a new hero, an exclusive ornament, an elite outfit, 3 scavanger crates and seven day champion status for less the price of the hero skins; buy the skin with steel, it is not worth it over the cheaper hero offers.
I bought it only so I can leave and repeat my problems with these skins lmao

It does not add anything new to the hero, such as having a unique execution specific to the hero, effects specific to the hero, dialogue that replaces voice lines from the default hero look or a unique symbol for the Emblem Editor.
Better to get this skin for the in-game 25000 steel than pay for it, even if it's not worth it in-game either unless you really like this appearance.

They hired a voice actor to represent the character of Baigujing in the event for this skins introduction, but they did not think to hire a voice actor for Monkey King or use existing voice lines or use additional diaolgue left on the cutting room floor that could have helped make this character stand out, they are fully capable of doing this, yet they refuse to do so.

It's a costly cosmetic that doesn't feel entirely worth it's price, much like the other skins.
They are fully capable to add unqiue sounds and more customization options to these skins: on 1st April 2023 they had a small event as part of an April Fools joke where they briefly replaced the appearance of heroes, replacing the effects they use and replacing some of their dialogue with funny sounds.

And they couldn't add unique dialogue to the Hero Skins because...?
Demanding quality of products is a customers right, regardless if you pay through money or your time.",0

25906,did the play test was very disappointed after the excitement of the prologue thought this game would be amazing what i got was poor quality buildings no sounds from inn etc no paths [i love a path to make things look good] was very clunky hard to work out controls unlike the prologue building menu was poor and when placing a building the option to rotate and have a shadow to show where it can be placed would help lost the menu and had the title bar appear thanks to the thread found out how to get rid and bring back the menu played 66 mins half was spent on working out controls and title bar issues got bored game had so much promise if it was like the prologue with a few tweaks but sadly i wont be interested if like it is now,0

25910,"Have been playing this game for just an hour and it already got me hooked! Its like vampire survivors with a more elaborate fighting system. You actively enagage in the fight and don't just run around. More akin to something like hades in that regards. 

And from what I could tell so far there is a surprising amount of content for an EA title with such a small price. Many different abilities you can combine and various different enemy/boss designs will await you.

And the menus!! They feel soo nice and juicy. I know thats probably not a deciding factor here, but shows how much love and care was put into this game!",1
25911,"This game is just a pure work of art ! Tho its quite under rated the Game play mechanics and Art style are just fabulous which follows its amazing soundtracks and different levels . 

Developed By : TEAM DASH GAMES 
Release Date : 13th May 2024

Visuals:   The visuals are cool and graphically the game is so good , the art style is quite hyperpop pyschedelic type and the concept of placing a darker colours as base in the game and everything be colourful and vibrant is just amazing , i assure you this game is going to hook you up for many hours. 

Soundtracks: The soundtrack perfectly complements the game's tone, with haunting melodies and adrenaline-pumping battle themes. The sound effects are crisp and impactful, adding to the overall immersion.

Gameplay :  Basically hack and slash but with more and more powerups and abilities . Talk about abilities there are many cool abilities which can be unlocked permanently and some boosters which u can gain while in action smacking the enemies.

Overall the game is pretty good and i liked it myself , If you would say to rate it i would definitely give it a solid 7.5/10 
With upcoming updates who knows it be a solid 10/10 ?  I would totally recommend trying out this game .",1
25912,"[h2]Chaos, Carnage, Neons and Upgrades![/h2]

In Dash x Survivors, prepare for an adrenaline-soaked journey through relentless waves of robots, where your only objective is survival. This hack 'n' slash action roguelike throws you into the thick of the action, challenging you to carve your own path to victory amidst the chaos.

25913,I played the demo and looking forward to dive into the full game! The designe is captivating and the skill tree is genial! Trying out different builds with verious synergies is super fun and keeps me coming back for more. The animation adds the extra flair. Very nice game!,1
25914,I've played the game for a few hours now and it's always new fun. I love the game design and the music. The skill tree is huge and every game is different depending on what you skill (I personally love a Dashy build ;)). I'm looking forward to new updates!,1
25915,"Truly amazing game!

Awesome moment to moment fun, huge flexibility in upgrades and a truly unique style that represents the adrenaline rush you feel while playing.
Especially intuitive controlls, UI and everything for a first release. Go get it while it is on sale, you will not regret it.",1
25916,"This is an excellent start for a game like this. It is missing a few things, a few menu changes, and of course some more content. Otherwise, I think this game will go far, if you like Vampire Survivors and Dynasty Warriors, welcome to the mix of both. 

Combat is simple to learn, dashes always feel nice, and the health is fair for the challenge of the game. I wouldn't describe the game hard, but it isn't easy, it takes a run or two to really get what you can do down.

6/10 as it sits, will go higher with updates.

Update 1: Easily 7/10 as it sits. I didn't play with extended time before my review, and that really changes things. An extra 2 minutes goes a long way to making amazing builds.",1
25917,"TLDR: 11/10 a must have for any gamer
average run length - perfect
difficulty scaling - perfect
gameplay - perfect
meta progression - perfect
music and art style - VIBE
builds + powerups on level ups - i couldn't calculate the combinations possible its so many
price and computer power required - i would pay at least triple the price for this and its so cleanly made it would run on a samsung microwave

this game and dev team get a pat on the back from me at the very least, honestly i see a bright future (no pun intended) for this game and the team behind it. well done.",1
25918,"Despite the fact that the game is in early access, it is not bad both in the visual component and in the game part. The game has a color changing mechanic depending on the choice, which adds dynamics to what is happening, changing color and music depending on the direction of action of the ability, so when using a defensive ability, the music changes to a slower and relaxing one, and in the case of an attacking one, it changes to a more dynamic one. It would be nice if other characters with different mechanics and a skill tree appeared in the game in the future, which would diversify the gameplay, but as long as the price matches the quality, I hope for the development of the game.",1
25919,I already played the demo and there seems to be a lot of cool new stuff in the early access version. There is a nice new meta progression with the chips aswell as the unlockable upgrades. There are a few more unique upgrades and the levels got harder (thanks to those annoying little ranged enemies >:( hate those guys) which makes it quite challenging and rewarding if you beat it. Its a great first release with quite a bit of content with the different difficulties and upgrades for an early access version.,1
25920,"Very nice game!
I've only played a few rounds so far, but they've been super fun and satisfying!
The game has very awesome interface and effects and is generally very polished and juicy.
At the beginning I was a little confused about some things, but that quickly resolved itself just by playing and figuring it out ^^

I can definitely recommend it!",1
25921,"This game got me hooked quite fast, it feels great to just dash around and whack a bunch of enemies. I also like the colorful, cyberpunk-style effects where each color has a matching soundtrack and playstyle (pink is my favorite so far). It¬¥s clear that the devs put a lot of love into this, a small but very well thought-out game with great attention to detail.",1
25922,"This game got me hooked pretty quick! It's got Juicy Gameplay and a great variety of perks that let you craft your very own playstyle with every run. The overall style and setting just ties it all perfectly together into a pretty dope Survivors-Like (Pun intended?)
Highly recommend, especially when it's on sale
",1
25923,"Great game. Its quick to learn, but really hard to master. 
The gameplay is fast and addictive. Great upgrade system, with a very nice skill tree.
Beautiful light and sound design that works very well with the fast paced gameplay.
For the price a must buy.",1
25924,"The idea is fantastic, the levels are fun, and with a bit of improvement, it can turn into an amazing game. If we can visually see more of the changes in the character, like the weapon transformations, it would be much more satisfying. You are awesome!

Fikir harika, b√∂l√ºmler eƒülenceli ve biraz √ºzerine koyarak m√ºthi≈ü bir oyuna d√∂n√º≈üebilir. Karakterdeki silah gibi deƒüi≈üimleri g√∂rsel olarak da daha fazla g√∂rebilirsek √ßok daha tatmin edici olur. Harikasƒ±nƒ±z",1
25925,"The game is a huge fun with very intuitiv controls which make it easy to get into it. With the various types of enemies and bosses, the fighting is really intense and interesting. It's also genuinely fun to go for different builds and try new playstyles!",1

If it was free, I'd say try this attempt at a 4th wall breaking game. There are no graphics, just text and although it is a little clever, it ends well before it gets interesting.

I need more than a game, I need an alternate reality and immersion and customization if possible.  Interesting meta game.  It's pricy but I'll support the developer.  I didn't really get all the achievements because I am lazy and I play games for the immersion.  But congrats to the developer, there is no game more simple than this one.  Yet.",1

[h1][b]üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics:[/b][/h1]

[table][tr][td]üî∂ ""The Simplest Game in the World"" lives up to its name in a rather unexpected way. Initially, it appears as if the game can be completed in just five minutes by pressing keys on the keyboard. However, upon further exploration, it becomes evident that the title conceals secrets and hidden content waiting to be discovered. The game lacks any gameplay mechanics and instead engages players in a conversation with an AI, where certain keywords trigger new dialogues and achievements. The developers didn‚Äôt bother to add any menus or even a button to quit the game, only to stay true to that title. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[table][tr][td]üî∑ When playing such a game, your level of enjoyment largely depends on your patience and curiosity. Uncovering all the secrets hidden in the game requires multiple playthroughs and experimentation. Although I couldn't find everything in the game, I‚Äôll provide you with all the secret keywords I found during my playthrough. I only advise seeing them in case you‚Äôre missing out a on few. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[h1][b]üì∑ Visuals & Audio:[/b][/h1]

[table][tr][td]üî∂ I am not really sure if it is okay to say that this game has visuals. The game mainly consists of a series of dialogues displayed on your screen as you interact with the AI. These dialogues appear on a retro-style monitor with a glitch-like effect, adding a touch of aesthetic uniqueness to the experience. However, if you're looking for elaborate visuals or any type graphical elements, you won't find them here. The focus is primarily on the textual interactions and the secrets hidden within the dialogues. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[table][tr][td]üî∑ In terms of audio, the game just has a single audio effect that plays whenever the AI is speaking something. Except that, I don‚Äôt remember the game having any other audios. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[h1][b]üìù Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]The dialogues are well-written.
    [*]The devs have added secrets to the game in a very clever way.
    [*]Very easy to understand. 
    [*]Can run on most rigs easily.
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]No gameplay mechanics.
    [*]No option to skip dialogues.
    [*]Very short.
[/list]

[hr]
[h1][b]üòá Honest Rating:[/b][/h1]

[table][tr][td]üî∂ Since the game aims at keeping everything simple, I‚Äôll also keep this simple. Even though ""The Simplest Game in the World"" lacks gameplay mechanics, it manages to captivate players through its mysterious elements. For just $2, it's worth exploring this minimalist experience and uncovering its secrets. However, do keep in mind that you‚Äôll have to play it quite a lot of times to find all the hidden keywords. If you are someone who does not have the patience to do that, please do not buy the game! [/td][/tr][/table]

Rating: 6.5/10
On my way to play an actual game.",1
25937,"Metafictional game where you want to find all the secrets.

The title of the game‚Äôs not far from the truth. Most of the time you‚Äôre not required to do anything at all. You simply sit and observe the words on the screen. True, you must occasionally hit a key to advance the game, but that key is very specific, and you must adhere to the game's rules.

The game is presented as text on an in-game computer screen. Someone is speaking to you and instructing you to hit a key. They want you to carry out their exact commands. If you interrupt them before they finish what they're saying, they'll be extremely rude to you and simply start the sentence again.

The experience lasts around half an hour. You get an achievement for following the rules and you‚Äôre instructed to hit ESC to exit the game. You can't close the game in the usual way till then. There is no menu, and the only way out is to force quit.

However, there are secrets to be found. If you look at the screen closely, you will notice various things that could lead to something more. The most obvious hint is that each key on the keyboard creates a unique pattern in the game. Then there's a series of numbers, flashing hearts, and specific words from the text. If you keep playing it a few times, you‚Äôll open another part of the game. 

The only major criticism is that you can't see what you're typing. As if that wasn't unpleasant enough, you also have to press enter to confirm the word. You may have thought of the correct solution, but the game would not accept it because you unknowingly made a typo.

Another small nuisance is that you need to quit the game if you want to try another path. Also, if you miss a clue and have to go through the normal game again, you won‚Äôt be able to skip forward.",1
25938,Great game. Worth it. Bit difficult though.,1
25939,"I grinded through this entire thing as I've read every other translated Kataoka Tomo VN and wanted to keep up that tradition. Don't follow my example, this might as well not be translated.

The translation is terrible, every sentence is at best, stilted, at worst, grammatically incorrect or nonsensical. If you're wondering, no it's not machine translation, it is done by a company called Tokyo Translation Team, looking at their website they seem reputable and fine enough, but they are clearly not. G-MODE/Nekoday you got scammed, please go back to MangaGamer or another actual good translation company for your next VN.

As for the actual plot, it revolves around the mystery of the main character who is immortal, and unable to leave Shinjuku. Except the first 2 chapters (out of 4), are fairly dull slice of life scenes with the mafia/public safety department/church, nothing much happens. Then the final 2 chapters do delve deeper into the mystery, and the reveals are fine, there's some solid scenes, but it's still nothing that notable.

Also the presentation here is a step-down from Christmas Tina, which is a shame as the art was a great in that, here it's just not as good.

Overall, if you want to read a great visual novel written by Kataoka Tomo surrounding the mystery of somebody being immortal, then read Winter Polaris, that actually has a nice translation.

By the way if you want to see if the translation is actually that bad, there is a demo, check that out instead of buying this.",0
25940,Translation is so bad it's probably MTL. Not worth it.,0
25941,"So glad that Persona 1 is getting a little love through this. 

Would love to see more Persona games be preserved including Aigis: First Mission and Persona 3 EM or the Persona 2 Tsumi: Lost Memories.


UPDATE: 

I would like to shoutout MKCAMK and team for starting an English translation of this game. 

You can check it out here: https://github.com/MKCAMK/G-MODE-Archives-translations/blob/main/README.md

We did it boys, Aigis First Mission is here! Keep 'em coming!
Huge props to them! Thank you for your work.",1

great on the steam deck thanks to having a suspend option if you can't get to a save area.",1
25943,"I have been studying Japanese for a good while now, so playing this isn't hard. It pretty much plays like a bite sized Persona 1 but with a smaller battle field and a lower encounter rate. If you're looking for more p1 content, this is definitely a good use of time. I personally really enjoy it, it's a little addicting clearing floors and gaining spell cards. As a fan of the original Persona, I highly recommend!",1
25944,"Nice little treat. Your millage will very a lot as a lot of my enjoyment was from the lost media aspect of this game. I felt like an archaeologist uncovering secrets from the past. I'm also a huge fan of persona 1 so some extra stuff like this is a big draw. The game itself though isn't anything that special, I will admit a lot of my enjoyment is from factors that exist around it then things it does itself. But art doesn't exist in a vacuum and those factors are very interesting to me. I don't want to sell the game completely short though, as I think it is impressive how much they were able to fit persona 1 into a flip phone, along with that the game loop is enjoyable enough. It's like a mix of persona 1 and 3. Unfortunately, there is no substantial plot and besides a few interesting moments it is mostly nothing. I enjoyed my time regardless.",1
25945,"Just some good, fun dungeon crawling. The game plays like Persona 1, of course, so if you enjoy it, you'll enjoy this game as well. The games goal is to climb to the top of the tower, but I won't spoil how many floors it is. You'll get to a rest floor every so often where your shops stock will update, you can access the Velvet Room, use the games bank, and upgrade your armor and weapons. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers.

The best part is, the game now has a fan translation. Big kudos to the team behind it, making this super fun game even more accessible to people, and thank you G-MODE for preserving and allowing us to play these neat, old mobile games. These are pieces of history I'm very thankful for as a huge ATLUS fan.",1

Giving a good review here just to see more mobile megaten being preserved",1
25952,"If you love Persona 1, you'll love this game. There's something cozy and nostalgic about it. It's unexpectedly enjoyable if you like DRPGs.

I am very grateful to G-MODE for rescuing this precious gem. I hope that it is not the last one.

And with the English patch available, there is now no excuse for any Megaten-head to not play it!

25970,"A cute, relaxing puzzle game - great if you're into Japan and trains! I would describe this more as a toy than a game - the puzzles are straightforward snap puzzles in which you assemble various train components, ultimately completing the entire train car.

You can choose from three difficulty modes, with two of them providing guidance on where to place the pieces. The game doesn't judge your performance, but it does keep track of your completion time and offers achievement challenges.

The layout mode is purely for relaxation and it allows you to choose from several different landscapes to build on, you can decorate each with all kinds of objects, place your trains, and enjoy the photo mode. It evokes the feeling of playing around with a nice model train diorama.

The encyclopedia mode is a nice way to learn more about each of the three featured trains, and you will be able to step inside each one to take a closer look. 

The trains in this game are all licensed but you won't find any real tracks, stations or station melodies, sadly.

The presentation is well done, I had one small issue where a certain puzzle piece was invisible against the background (white on white) and the controls on Steam Deck do not default to 'Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad' which the game is designed around, so you will have to change that yourself before playing on Steam Deck.

I'm also experiencing some of the achievements not tracking correctly, though I assume that will be resolved with a patch. This title is priced perfectly for what it is.",1
25971,"[h1] ""A Platformer Gem That Defies Gravity"" [/h1]

""Titled"" takes the platformer genre and flips it, quite literally, on its head. With its unique gravity-defying mechanics and captivating world, this game offers an intriguing twist that's both challenging and refreshing. While it might not achieve perfection, ""Titled"" is a standout addition to the platformer landscape that will keep you engaged with its gravity-altering puzzles and captivating atmosphere.

Innovative Gameplay Mechanics:
The core gameplay mechanic of altering gravity introduces a whole new level of complexity to the platformer genre. Navigating the levels involves strategic thinking as you switch between different gravitational forces to overcome obstacles and uncover secrets. While it might take a bit to get used to, once mastered, it offers a rewarding sense of accomplishment.

Mind-Bending Puzzles:
""Titled"" doesn't just test your platforming skills; it also challenges your cognitive abilities. The game's puzzles require a mix of timing, reflexes, and logic. Some puzzles might leave you scratching your head, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally crack them is unparalleled.

Immersive World Design:
The game's visuals and world design deserve praise for creating an immersive environment. Each level is a unique setting, from floating islands to mysterious underground caverns, all intricately designed to fit the gravity-manipulating theme. The attention to detail in the environments enhances the overall experience.

""Titled"" successfully innovates in a genre that often treads familiar ground. Its gravity-defying mechanics, mind-bending puzzles, and immersive world design create an engaging experience that will keep you coming back for more. The game's unique concept and well-executed gameplay make it a platformer well worth diving into. If you're looking for a fresh take on the genre and enjoy a challenge, ""Titled"" is a title you won't want to miss.",1

25985,"Hello there. 
Watch out! Spoilers are really spoilers and for such a short game they might kill your fun from this game! 

I have some stuff to comment on here:
 1st of all I like the game, the idea is cool, and it is easy to catch what it is about but then:
- The 1st jump of learning is just repeating every time you want to redo the game it would be nice if there were an option to skip it.
- The 4th jump as well is repeating and [spoiler] shows that every crewmember had a motive - it would be better if only 2 members were plotting of escape and 3rd shows that talks with some family member that he/she is coming back or smth that is not making them look criminal. [/spoiler]
- It would be nice if there were more pieces of evidence of them being the killer [spoiler] (other than bloody weapons [Pilot and Civilian] and just telling the AI that they did it [Enginer]) [/spoiler]
- I would love to see some ""cinematic"" intro of the killer killing and sabotaging the AI or crew members finding the Captain (Kinda like in the Darkest Dungeon for example)
- It would be nice to see some evidence in such an intro and then crews talking about it during jumps giving some more hints about who did it (Like someone hiding/discarding from the ship)
- Last but not least I would love to see the story behind the killer if the player finds out who it was or if nobody was a killer and the player didn't kill them.
- I played some games and didn't get ""A Passing Shadow"" even a possibility, always someone was always the killer. I don't know how RNG is working there but I really would like to have some ""restart"" button in the menu so that after I see evidence of the killer I could use it. 

Overall good game, I like the graphics style and soundtrack. It would be nice if you'd add some more of this cool music. It's good to have another murderer game as I love detective stories.",1

[h1]Talking Dirty While Balls are Bouncing on the Screen[/h1]
[b]Hentai Direct-her[/b] is the kind of game you play with low expectations and ends up surprising you because of how fun it is. The game is a Pong clone in which you pick a girl to audition casting couch style (but without the couch) and play against her, hitting some clapper cards that make them moan, talk dirty, or strip. The gameplay is decent and comes with three different difficulties and the option to adjust the ball's speed, allowing you to make the game either a piece of cake or hard as balls. Also, the visuals are pleasing and improve the experience, so give it a shot if you're looking for a fun game to kill some time with.",1
25993,"So you think you're good at pong?? WELL THINK AGAIN, NERD!! This ain't pong! This is legally-distinct pong with boobs jiggling in your face! It's porng! Still think you've got what it takes? Try playing on the hardest difficulty, maximum points, and the fastest ball selected all while trying to score when sultry women moan and talk dirty in your ears and then we'll talk. Think you've got what it takes to last long enough?

[b]TL;DR[/b]
GreatherGames continues to put out some really good quality arcade-style games that add a nice lewd twist to classic games! Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a good way to pass the time and maybe get a bit of naughty fun out of it, this is a real good one to pick up!
+ Neat character descriptions to give you an idea of what to expect from each girls' dirty talk
+ Music is a real bop
+ Supports local co-op ;)
+ Voice acted to funnel that lewdness directly into your ears
+ Dev is receptive to feedback and making changes
+ Game difficulty is customizable, is as easy or difficult as you want it to be
- No real sense of end-game
-----------------------------------------

[h1]--- Overview ---[/h1]
Play legally-distinct non-trademarked pong-style gameplay against five unique girls auditioning to becoming p*rn stars, each with their own character, dirty talk, and personalities in this lewd romp of an arcade game! The more you win, the more girls you unlock until you've unlocked all five girls!

[h1]--- The LEWDS ---[/h1]
I consider this game's lewds to be akin to an appetizer. That's not a bad thing, some of the best food on the planet are appetizers. But if you want to pass the time and feel a bit naughty in the meantime, it's a really great game to go to.

As you play the game, you collect clapper cards that contain a prompt for the girl to do. Whether that be moaning in your ear, saying dirty talk related to their specific kinks, or strip off a random piece of clothing, it really makes concentrating on the game that much more of a challenge. What I find especially awesome is that the stripping off of random clothing means you can get some really nice combinations of top on + bottoms off or bottoms off + top off.

Each of the five currently-available girls have specific kinks that they pander to, whether you're looking for a lewd girl to call you daddy, a domineering mommy, or just plenty of lewd JOI-style comments telling you what to do~.

Sarah best girl, this is not up for debate, she's even the title girl. Game knows she best.

[h1]--- Gameplay Overview ---[/h1]
When selecting your difficulty, you're given three options to choose from, the opponent's AI difficulty, the score you're trying to reach, and how fast the ball goes. In my opinion, the best way to experience the game is with all of these options at their highest level possible! The other options aren't bad by any means, but I really enjoyed the challenge. Even with these options, you can still clear all 5 girls in under an hour.

Something worth noting is that when you score a point, the game doesn't pause, it just continues again immediately. This can (and likely will) cause you to unfairly lose quite a few points as the ball immediately goes through your goal or you just can't react in time for it. On the other hand, the same thing can happen to your opponent as well. It would have been much more intuitive to click to start the round again.

You can also play with local co-op if you've got someone irl to play with you, allowing for mouse controls for one person and keyboard controls for another! I did mess around with this a tiny bit by myself and it seemed to work pretty well, though I can't say I'm brave enough to ask someone irl to help with more thorough testing.

As it is, your Reputation is entirely based on how many points you score. Whether that means you set up a fake 2-person game to ensure you unlock the girls as fast as possible (but sacrifice the lewd content for whatever reason) or decide to have some *real* fun by playing Hard -> 7 points -> Fast for the ultimate experience, the actual difficulty of the game is entirely yours to decide.

[h1]--- Issues / Bugs ---[/h1]
¬∑ Can't hit ESC to pause the game while playing, have to click the top right icon (meaning, basically don't try to pause unless you just want to go back to the menu)

[h1]--- Final Thoughts ---[/h1]
A very fun, albeit short, lewd arcade game (roughly under an hour of game time)! I'm honestly surprised I haven't seen a game like it before on Steam but it's a welcome addition! The developer is also very receptive to feedback and does his best to accommodate any changes they feel is worth it, which automatically puts this game above most of the cash-grab uncaring devs you've got in this genre of Steam games. It's definitely worth a grab for some raunchy arcade-y pong-like fun!

25995,"""Hentai Direct-Her"" is a naughty Pong clone. The idea is for you to direct the girl via aiming your ball to strike the clapperboards and, at the same time, score your opponent to take the point. You collect points to unlock more girls but also to strip your current girl. The clapperboards have different functions, you can make the girls talk dirty, strip and moan.

There are 5 different girls, fully voiced. The music is upbeat since you are in a match! You can pick between 3 difficulty levels, 3 score points needed to finish the match and 3 ball speeds. None of them matter to the score, you get 1 point for every goal regardless of anything else.

It's a welcomed naughty change of a classic game. For this price, it's worth it!

25997,I started to play just for a bit. But I got so into it I didn't want to stop. Beautiful graphics. Music is amazing. Loved it so much i even went ahead and bought the soundtrack.  Great game. i love it.  I wanna thank the developer for such an amazing game.,1
25998,"a ton of new content, both levels and mechanics, for one of the best match-3s on the market for an affordable price. there are more levels here than in the base game (750 vs. 500), highly recommended.",1
25999,"Nice distraction, but repetitive gameplay and resource scavenging aren't very exciting.

The game has two modes. There's survival, in which you look for gear, improve, and gradually progress throughout the entire landscape. This might be called the primary mode. Horde mode is more action-oriented, with adversaries constantly attacking you. Both modes can be played at any of five difficulty levels. 

Don't worry if you don't enjoy survival components. Despite the name, the game does not include any. The only thing you have to worry about is energy. Lack of energy results in slower stamina restoration. This is easily addressed when you sleep in a bed. Sleeping also gives you a momentary perk. 

The controls are typical for a first-person shooter. You roam around, shoot zombies, gather anything you can find, and simply try to survive. Healing isn't automatic, so keep an eye out for two types of bandages and two types of shield kits to replenish your shield. 

New weapons are uncovered is supply rooms. There's a good selection, but you can only take three at a time. Another interesting element is the weapon and equipment upgrades that can be found flying around. They are divided into four tiers, with the legendary being the finest, boosting every single stat of a weapon. Using lower tier upgrades might be a waste of resources because one single legendary is all you need too fully boost a weapon. 

When you go to a workbench, which is always available at supply locations, you can upgrade or make new items. You can also swap any weapon you've discovered. Grabbing every valuable resource is critical because it allows you to build ammo and even upgrades. Resources can be located in containers like purses and briefcases. This is a bit of a pain because they're difficult to see in the environment and there's no visible cue on the screen to direct you to one. 

The map is open.  It‚Äôs not very huge, but it allows you to search a few buildings for resources. The city is divided into four sectors that you can win by surviving waves. If you survive, a new supply rooms opens where you can stock up for the next switch. Zombies are not smart because they come at you in a straight line. Most of the times you can take out an entire wave by moving backwards while shooting forward. It‚Äôs also quite challenging because it‚Äôs easy to get stuck in the environment. Once you‚Äôre surrounded, you‚Äôre practically dead.

You can build traps and repair explosive barrels, but you will waste resources that could be used for weapons and crafting. Since resources are limited, you can't afford to create just everything.",1

I like this game, the movement is smooth and pretty simple, the game mechanics are interesting and fun. the main problem i have are the turrets and how they work. they shoot and you infinity and if your hit, it instant kills you. this would be fine if it wasn't for the way their used. take level 4 for example, the amount of turrets make that level hard-ish. it's a fun level but at the beginning of me playing it it was annoying. i would still recommend though.",1
26027,"While broken in many areas, this game is phenomenal. With a little bit of practice you can blitz through stages with simple yet deep movement mechanics. The horizontal stages are great, but vertical stages take practice for them to be fun. Some levels are frustrating, but find a level you like and try to lower your time. I highly recommend trying for a sub 40 second time in stage 25 without using bombs. Put on some synthwave music while you're at it.",1

For starters, they're always shooting, they don't stop. They track you behind walls and everything. They also have a stupidly high rate of fire for something that kills you in one hit, there's also just too many of them in multiple levels. The turrets are just really badly designed.

The friction is also just so weird... I don't know how you're supposed to do anything when you're flying everywhere constantly and have so little control over yourself.

More power to you if you like this game and you could say that it's just a skill issue on my end (besides the obvious bugs) but we all have our opinions.

jesus hell.. after ~35 in one level I just gave up.. crap contorls met with turrets shooting at ya and insta killing ya while you also have to do weird as hell jumps of pylons that are rng and rive you no controls at all..



Hell even the tutorial: Step 3: Climbing

1x1 can be jump over when pressing forward and jump at the same time.

26076,"Reviewed on: 2024/06/08
Score: 2/10, only because it's a finished game.
Playtime: About 6 hours for a single playthrough, much more if you're a completionist and are [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3263603160]stuck guessing the effects of choices[/url], and haven't [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3263536065]unlocked text-skipping[/url].

[h3]TL;DR:[/h3]
In all honesty, I'm having trouble finding words to describe this AVN that wouldn't insult the dev. So, instead of a TL;DR, I'll just let the game speak for itself (verbatim, except spoiler tag):
[i]""He wasted no time flipping [spoiler]Courtney[/spoiler] around and sliding his dick into her ass and ready to fuck it like he had never done before. [Player] got the lube he had as you need lube to put it in anyone's ass. As he sldie the lubed cock in her ass slowly""[/i]

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
Dialog choices will change how Love Interests view the MC, but the effect of the player's answers aren't shown. Worse, most choices only affect the single line the MC says, with the other character always having the same reply/reaction. The dev has also disabled the ability of the player to skip seen and unseen text.
This is player unfriendly design. You not only have to guess what each LI likes (if you care), but also have to keep clicking to skip text when replaying and trying different paths.  Luckily, the number of points needed to get the ""good"" ending is low, and players can luck in to it.
The game is divided in a prologue and 21 days, with a single-choice freeroam section dividing them. From reading the code, I get the sense that the dev's original plan was a lot bigger, with the MC having a stamina stat (limited amounts of actions per day). In this version, the freeroam's only use is to make the player navigate to a specific LI's room, to do that day's event.

[h3]Adult:[/h3]
There are a few renders of naked women, and lots of text describing what they and the MC do with each other.  The main theme of the game (I think) is about dealing with grief, unresolved conflict, and coming to term with past mistakes.

[h3]Visual[/h3]:
During dialog, cutouts of characters are placed on top of a blurred background, slyly looking straight at the camera while talking to each other.
These cutouts will move their mouth while talking, and will sometimes change their facial expression, but that's it.  They won't change their posture or move their limbs.
This background doesn't change often enough either. Text describes how the MC visits a different location, or takes part in certain activities, without it being shown.
Seeing how text-heavy this game is, this design seems like the bare minimum, if that.

Lewd scenes get special treatment. Bodies are actually posed, and one or two renders show the gist of what's going on. These renders are also accompanied by a lot of text, describing things we never get to see, usually foreplay and climaxes.
Some lewd scenes have a short animation. Sadly, I can't be very positive about these either. For instance, in the animations with Cheerleader and Lawyer, we'll see the MC thrusting, but his penis just remains static (as in, not going in & out).  The animations also look as if they're cut together by playing a shorter animation in forward and reverse, then repeating this segment a few times.
Looking at some animations side by side, it's obvious the dev saved time by re-using the same scenes and animations, only replacing the LI's model.
Some animations are outright nauseating, like the anal scene with [spoiler]Courtney[/spoiler], with the camera bobbing in an X-shaped motion as if it's the bouncing logo meme.

[h3]Sound:[/h3]
There are no sound effects or voices/sex-sounds, yet the volume sliders are present for them.
The game has music, with scenes have their own track. These tracks usually contain lyrics and are fairly high energy, often not matching the atmosphere of what's happening on the screen.
Personally, I find this type of music distracting while reading and viewing.

[h3]Novel:[/h3]
This game's writing is unlike anything I've ever seen, and not in a good way.
Example: [i]""They make out with their naked bodies together with [Player]'s dick getting hard and so big. cheerleader is surprised he is so big.""[/i]
Or, how about: [i]""Cheerleader kisses him passionately and they put each other's hands all over their hot bodies. She takes his dick into her mouth and begins to suck on it. It tastes salty and feels warm as his cock hits the back of her throat. she deepthroats it several times""[/i]

This isn't a translation issue. Even a machine translation would be better if the writer mastered their native language.  Huge amounts of typos and spelling mistakes also betray the fact that the writer did write these lines, and not pasted them in from an external tool.

It's not only the quality of the writing that's bad, there is no common-sense progression to the story.
A certain LI will tell us she slept with her teacher to get good grades, later, we learn she was sexually active for years before the MC arrived. The MC also has penetrative sex with her, and somehow, a few days later, he'll feel her hymen break during another romp.  And, to top it all off, at the end of the game we'll learn that [spoiler]the MC's dad had sex with all LI for years.[/spoiler].
By telling the story about the MC and his father in a segmented and sometimes anachronistic way, it becomes even more difficult to understand.

During my first playthrough, I thought that the pacing of the growing intimacy was relatively well done. However, on the playthrough where I made negative choices, everything still happened the same way, except for the ending.  This is too bad. If LIs would actually react differently toward the MC based on his behavior toward them, at least the game would've had this going for it.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]
Despite my negative review, I do respect the dev for publishing a finished game, I think Dad would be proud.  It's far from perfect, but the basics are there. Story concept, thousands of words, structure, renders, animations, ... It's clear some shortcuts were taken, and maybe playtesters didn't provide actionable feedback.
I hope the dev keeps at it and hones his skills, starting by polishing this game a bit more before starting on Episode 2.
For now though, avoid this game.

I'm legit stuck on the first free roam event

edit: Thank you for changing it, on the day 3 free roam, I got stuck again, but then I realized there is a right arrow to reach Cheyenne's room, I missed that.
Freeroams do feel rather pointless, because it seems like you can only find one character to click on and progress - so check 3 rooms and hope its not empty.

There are a few renders and some lewd animations, but its mostly 'cardboard' characters, even some lewds are done like that, feels like it makes it more novel than visual.

I read some text, can't say much about that.

I liked some music tracks.",1
26078,"It is an alright spot the difference game with interesting art style and 10 levels with 20 differences each to find.
I had 2 issues with it:
- no mute button for music
- some differences have to small of a hitbox and it is too easy for it not to count correctly, especially on those where the item is completely missing from the picture.

UFindO is a short find-the-difference puzzle game. The game houses 10 levels with each 20 differences between them. As the time you take to find the differences increase, so decreases your score. Need help finding some? You can use the Hint option for a 1000 point reduction. If your score reaches 0 you lose.

The hard drawn pictures have a certain charm to it. The game runs smooth and will take about 30 minutes to an hour to complete. There are two down sides though;
-No sound option.
-A few hitboxes are very very small.

All with all the game isn't bad for the price they ask.",1
26080,"UFindO is yet another asset/template from serial shovelware pushers, Piece Of Voxel.  These guys do nothing but copy premade game templates and game tutorials, fill out a few things/stamp out basic levels using the construction kit templates, slap on an asset flipped set of sprites/assets, and dump them on Steam and into cheap nasty shovelware game bundles as cash grabs.  Trying to get paid for someone else's game templates, assets... at best, this is shovelware, at worst, it's a scam/cash grab.

Today they got their hands on someone's artwork or something and slapped it onto a barebones, very basic Unreal Engine blueprint for a ""spot the differences"" browser/mobile game.  Look at two slightly different versions of the same crap childrens artwork and tap on the differences on your iPhone screen.  Of course, being asset flip scammers, Piece of Voxel wants your money for this garbage. 

Piece Of Voxel have shown a repeat pattern of unethically dumping other people's work onto Steam as a cheap, nasty cash grab, through this account or through closely linked/alt accounts.  Here's some examples so you can see for yourself:

Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The artwork here is terrible, it's all just amateurish ""My First Wacom Tablet"" style drawings used instead professional looking game assets.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can create graphical assets properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low, enough on its own to deter gamers.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just point and click stuff like a browser/Flash game.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

For gameplay purposes, because the user interface for this game is mostly just 2D static text/images... it might as well be a web page.  It's functionally no different from a browser game.  And we all know, Steam isn't here to compete with Chrome and Firefox.  If the game can be done in a web browser, it's just not rich or compelling enough to appeal to serious gamers on PC.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

It's also important to note the ""developer"" here has connections to a number of shady Russian asset flippers and review manipulators who show an organised pattern to scam and defraud gamers with fake reviews and asset flipping the work of others for profit.  While reviews are about the games, gamers should be informed when developers act unethically.   Whether these connections are the same developer using multiple accounts, or just working closely with other unethical developers, gamers should be warned about the harm to gamers by this developer and their associates.  Buying games from unethical developers puts your money at risk.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

UFindO is relatively cheap at $1 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.[/quote]

Dreamsweeper is a fun puzzle game that combines a roguelike minesweeper puzzle with battling monsters through a rhythm game. You'll keep descending floors to the next puzzle and the next and the next. The type of enemies that walk around are based on which of the 4 worlds you're playing. You'll unlock a new world after completing a world, which also opens up endless mode on the previous world. The monsters in later worlds felt harder, but that might also be because their timing is less forgiving than the purple attack the enemies in the first world do. 

It feels like the main character walks a little slow, but this seems to be on purpose because you don't want to set a step too far while working out a puzzle. Another thing that I noticed only very late is that while you can have 3 heads with you, you can only wear one, and that one is which buff you currently have. While typing this.. it makes sense.. it is a hat.. we don't wear stacks full of heads. However, with the design in the game and the shop selling always 3 heads, it wasn't so clear to me before. 

Dreamsweeper has a bunch of nice achievements. Most of them aren't hard and you'll unlock them just for playing the game. There are achievements for playing the puzzles and battles on the highest difficulty. I don't recommend combining those but just do them one by one. As the battles are way longer and the floors are way bigger in both cases. Finding the treasure room requires some luck. You have a chance to find it each time you change floors. The developer just increased the spawn frequency so it shouldn't be too hard to find it while going for the rest of the achievements. 

I give Dreamsweeper 3 out of 5 stars.

26090,"Despite slight grind and repetitive play to unlock new stages, minesweeper mechanics are fun enough to get you to the ending.

Your objective is to reach the exit stairs by walking across tiles and avoiding black holes. Gameplay is easy because you only need to take steps across the floor and mark risky tiles. This is accomplished by utilizing minesweeper mechanisms. As you walk, you will either expose multiple tiles because you walked on an empty tile, or a number tile that indicates how many black tiles surround you.

Most are situated right on the path you need to walk on, so you can flag them and make them harmless. If you make a mistake and tread on one, you will lose one of your three hearts. When you lose them all, you will wake up in your room and be forced to restart the entire stage. 

Rhythm plays a role during enemy confrontations. All you have to do is watch for arrows and press the button when one lands on one of the four markers. Projectiles come in a variety of types, and some can even heal you or force you to press the opposite button, but precision is not essential. The only difference between ""bad"" and ""perfect"" is how much damage you cause. 

Your skill level, or lack thereof, is not an issue because the game may be tailored to your preference. Aside from the overall difficulty, which increases the quantity of bombs and room size, you can also adjust the rhythm difficulty, which may be appropriate for people who are not as quick. 

Flagging all holes each floor and defeating enemies will earn you the game's cash. This can be used in a shop to purchase one-time items that make life easier. Some of them are keys that unlock chests containing additional money and books that restore a heart. While objects are designed to solve the classic minesweeper problem, this does not always work. There are still too many occasions where you must guess which tiles are safe. This becomes brutally obvious at the highest difficulty level, resulting in impossible scenarios and forcing you to rely on luck.  

This feature isn‚Äôt very useful because you can find a lot of items all over the stage. Although you can only carry two goods, this is not a major issue because they do not disappear. Accessories are another aspect that is not really useful. While you can only have one equipped, you can fast switch between them to use their effect. Accessories are more like modifiers in that they can make things simpler or harder; for example, you can add or remove an extra heart. 

Stages are random, so you can be lucky and locate an exit right away. However, you will still have to clear a few rooms because exits are frequently sealed and require a particular number of stars (a star is awarded for defeating all enemies in an area or flagging all tiles). One annoying bug is that the game changes from full screen to window mode each time you play a new stage. You either have to press Alt-Enter each time, or simply play in window mode.

You are encouraged to clear as many tiles as possible in order to earn rewards. The better you do, the more you will fill the bar, which unlocks new furniture for your room, music, new items that may come in the game, and, most importantly, next worlds.

The game consists of four worlds, with each new world increasing the amount of stages required to complete a world. The reward is a dream sequence that offers more information on the entire story, as well as the world's infinity mode, which allows you to play for as long as you wish or until you run out of hearts.

The grind to open new worlds is the only criticism. Beating a world doesn‚Äôt give you enough, so you need to play the infinity mode. Luckily, you can play at the lowest difficulty and quickly clear a floor.",1

26092,"Great game, amazing concept. I keep experiencing a bug where I can't turn to look in a direction *without moving* which basically makes the game unplayable. 

If the dev fixes then this is an easy purchase.

More details for dev: 
The controls work the way I would expect them to when I'm walking around the bedroom between levels but as soon as I get into a level, I can't turn without moving anymore. I've tried switching controller types (between controller (xbox one) and keyboard). 

I'm playing on both expert difficulties (rhythm and puzzle) with 1920 x1080p resolution and I didn't see a way to adjust/cap the frame rate (in case it was that frame rate bug where the game runs faster on higher frames). 

Good luck dev, I really do love the concept and am excited to get the bugfix~",0

[Kawaii/Puzzle] Very cozy, relaxed ""Sweeper""-genre with roguelite dungeon crawler element. Moreover, the combat against foes is rhythm-based fun battle. Tremendously cute anime artwork.

26095,"A super chill and relaxing twist on minesweeper, fairly true to the original. If you like minesweeper then you will like this game, it's that simple.

There are a few day one bugs that make the game annoying right now, but the devs have said they are actively working on ironing them out. In addition, there are a couple of QoL features that veteran minesweepers might want to see added in the future, but this is a relatively minor nitpick.

The rhythm mechanic seems a bit out of left field when paired with minesweeper, but it doesn't feel bad at all and adds some speed in an otherwise very calm and slow game.

Much like how minesweeper is best played while on a bus or on the toilet, this game would do very well on a mobile platform like Nintendo Switch (another thing the devs have said they will work on), so look forward to that.",1
26096,Normal minesweeper is more fun I think.  The game is not intuitive to me.,0
26097,DreamSweeper is a really fun game that takes the old MineSweeper game and turns it into an adventure. I like the game because it has cool power-ups and the tougher levels make you think.  It's also cool that you have to use your timing skills to take down the bosses.  I also really enjoy the music and the game play makes things fun.  Two thumbs up.,1
26098,"In Dreamsweeper, you play as a girl who falls asleep listening to music each night, only to awaken in a mysterious dream world where she must confront her deepest fears and anxieties. The game's narrative is simple, and the dreamy setting adds a touch of surrealism that makes the player's journey all the more entertaining.

Dreamsweeper's gameplay is a seamless blend of various genres, primarily focusing on dungeon crawling, roguelike elements, and Minesweeper-inspired puzzle mechanics. As you explore the procedurally generated dream worlds, you'll encounter Minesweeper-like rooms that require logic and deduction to navigate. Each step you take carries risks, and successfully clearing blocks will provide numerical hints to help you locate hidden dangers.

To combat the menacing enemies representing the protagonist's anxieties, the game employs rhythm-based mechanics that require precise timing and focus. The fusion of these diverse gameplay elements creates a truly unique experience that keeps players engaged and challenged throughout their adventure.

You can customize your gameplay experience with a range of accessories, adapt to different challenges, and uncover hidden collectibles throughout the dream world. Visit in-game shops to purchase items and accessories to enhance your journey. For the truly daring, an infinite mode provides a thrilling challenge to test your skills and experiment with new strategies.  

One of Dreamsweeper's most defining features is its distinct lo-fi musical aesthetic, which complements the dreamy atmosphere perfectly. The game's visuals are charming and whimsical, bringing the fantastical dream world to life with vibrant colors and imaginative designs. The music is an integral part of the gameplay experience, providing a soothing backdrop to the tense moments of puzzle-solving and combat.

In conclusion,  Dreamsweeper is a one-of-a-kind gaming experience that successfully combines elements of dungeon crawling, roguelike, and Minesweeper, all set to an enchanting lo-fi musical backdrop. With its imaginative setting, and captivating presentation, this game offers a truly memorable adventure that's not to be missed. Whether you're a fan of puzzles, roguelikes, or just looking for a unique indie gem, Dreamsweeper is definitely worth your time and attention.

26099,I love the style and art of it. A little bit of a puzzle game but with battles and other cool stuff. I loved it!,1
26100,"I fell asleep and woke up in this game. I fell asleep in the game and woke up in my life. I don't know where I am anymore. This game is pretty great, the music is really engaging and the game play is relaxed yet complex enough to challenge. Going to play this one allot more!",1
26101,"Excellent game, it is extremely relaxing and I love playing it before bed!",1
26102,"This is an incredibly charming and delightful game that does exactly what it sets out to do. The music makes the experience something to truly just relax to. This game is absolutely 100% worth the $10 asking price in terms of replayability. Highly recommend this if you like Minesweeper.

Also, the adjustable difficulty makes the game incredibly accessible to people who aren't Minesweeper fiends, but for those who are, expert mode is still a great challenge, especially since you can't jump around the map like you can in traditional browser minesweeper, so you need to be more direct in dealing with the rooms than just going ""oh i'll do that later"" like I do when I play regular Minesweeper.",1
26103,"Cute Game! I would prefer more fail-safes to prevent miss-steps onto tiles (playing with keyboard/mouse), but overall a very cool concept!",1
26104,Super fun and relaxing game. Beautiful music to go along with it,1
26105,"I really enjoyed Dreamsweeper, not only because of its playability and easy controls but also their technical aspects such as graphics, art and music. Would totally recommend!",1
26106,"I recently came across a game that I think is worth sharing. The music in this game is fantastic‚Äîit really draws you in and adds so much to the overall experience. It creates an atmosphere that's hard to pull away from.

The game's style is another highlight. It looks fantastic and has this great blend of old-school charm with modern flair. The concept is like a next-level Minesweeper, taking something familiar and making it way more interesting and fun.

What truly stands out is the story and adventure elements, which are top-notch. There's a sense of unfolding excitement that keeps you hooked as you play. The controls might seem a bit tricky at first, but they start to make a lot of sense once you get the hang of them.

Dreamsweeper combines all these elements perfectly. If you're looking for a game that's visually appealing, has a great story, and offers a fresh take on a classic concept, this is definitely worth downloading.",1
26107,"Nice cozy game. It feels right at home on the Steam Deck and runs perfectly. 

I found it to be a bit too easy when playing on the default difficulty setting (at least in the first world), which feels strange to say about something clearly meant to be relaxing, but luckily there are multiple difficulty sliders that can be adjusted separately to get the game to your liking (do you want harder/easier tap timing mini games or harder/easier minesweeping?).",1
26108,"I've only played a few levels so far, but I'm hooked! It combines a bunch of my favorite game genres - puzzle game meets rhythm game meets dungeon crawler roguelike! Time flies while playing this game. The puzzles and traversal are stimulating while the environment and music are soft and soothing. Really well done :)",1
26109,"Very nice aesthetics in this game. The graphics are very delicate and the music is simply sublime. Simple, but very effective gameplay.",1
26110,"Chill lofi beats to daydream to. This game is great! I'm a big fan of Oatmello's music and all of his creative endeavors, so I had to give this one a shot. It did not disappoint. A soothing way to ease your mind while also getting a mental workout with the steady puzzles. Fun for all ages with one heck of a sleepy laid-back soundtrack.",1

[h1]A traditional VS like experience[/h1]

Nyran Survivors is a traditional VS like, which while enjoyable, doesn‚Äôt bring anything new to the table. Personally, I enjoyed the art style, along with how balanced everything felt. While I do enjoy overpowered skills, I eventually end up following the same build, ruining my experience.

My experience with Nyran Survivors was good, however, there wasn‚Äôt enough to keep me going. The dopamine hit I feel in other VS likes wasn‚Äôt felt here and I‚Äôm not sure why. It could be due to the lack of flashy skills which feel overpowered, or what felt like a slower pace gameplay experience.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs not a bad game and I do recommend it to those who like the genre. If you‚Äôre expecting a fresh experience however, I‚Äôd look elsewhere. Nyran Survivors follows the formula to a T without innovating in any meaningful or notable way.

26116,"Game has great potential. Kinda like soulstone survivors with a minecraft/roblox aesthetic.
Few things I'd like to see in future updates:
- actual damage per second summary accessible during and after the game (not just damage amount)
- need cursor customisation - bigger and brighter so it doesnt get lost so often
- health bar over the character head, or at least the option to have one
- perhaps i am not far enough yet and this is already in the game at later stages but a leech mechanic would be nice (apart from elite kills, like, just generic leech)
- possibly bit better feedback on when you take damage
- enemy projectiles are sometimes pretty small and definitely get lost in the mayhem, the orange fireball things are fine but the tiny white arrows can be hard to see
- the ability to toggle auto-aim. i am good to manually aim with elites/bosses but when its just trash mobs i'd love to be able to have a rest and let the game aim (soulstone and halls of torment both have this qol feature)
- when my character goes behind buildings/walls we lose him/her, an outline would be great",1

26126,"This Game First Official Steam Review:

Yeah guys and gals, I've only played this game like 20 minutes, but I gotta go to work and I totally wanna sit here and grind this bad boy for a couple of hours at least.  It's hella fun and I bet I've played about 60 to 70 of these VS like games on Steam to date.

This is definitely one of the better ones.  The gameplay is smooth with no lag, the special effects look great, and the music perfectly fits this type of game. 

What I love however early on is the amount of upgrading and expanding you can do in this game with your earned gold and collected gems.  It seems like you'll need to play this game for hundreds of hours to unlock all the most buff and best geared classes.. and that's good because this game seems like it'd be a blast grinding that long.


Early Review:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you like VS type games.  I love it, you probably will to!  ..I fully expect this game to be one of the more successful VS games on Steam in the coming months and years.",1

26128,"[code]Written By Hidden Gems Review : https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38624426/, Follow me! [/code]

Nyran Survivors is a roguelite game. Is the classic survivors like in 3D, there isn't much inovation in comparation with other survivors like but it's well designed and balanced with a big variety of skills classes and builds so it's fun with high replay value.",1
26129,"Doesn't really bring much new to the table, but that isn't a bad thing. It's a solid vampire survivors-like that's worth the 7 bucks :).",1
26130,"Definitely gives you a decent amount of fun and play time for its cost, I would say it's a unique take on the ""horde survivor"" genre to an extent, both graphically and mechanically.

One con, or maybe even pro for some, in comparison to other games is the lack of automatic aiming or aiming at nearest enemy, a lot of abilities are cursor aim focused which can also be what distinguishes it from a lot of the other games in the genre.

The game also has a dodge mechanic I haven't seen in most other horde survivors, this uses space and essentially allows you to skillfully get a short moment of immortality, useful for facing bosses and what not.

It seems like the game does have some degree of AFK capability by focusing majorly on blocking and healing upgrades, initially this was not that intuitive to me and it was a thing I was missing for a while early on, in comparison to other games in the genre.

",1
26131,"Very enjoyable game overall.

Very good for casual gaming, jump in and out for a quick session, which is what I prefer for this genre of game. Also has a leader board for those which are more competitive to rank your score vs others if you like that type of thing.

Different classes are available for all play styles which includes level and characters unlocks - good for people who like 'progressing' and levelling up etc. Fun type graphics that don't take itself too seriously but work well.

For the price you are paying you can't go wrong really at this price point - even if your not much of a fan of the genre itself. Its great to pass any idle time you may have - regardless if you have a short amount of free time available or alternatively prefer a longer game, both in fact do work with this game regardless.",1

Game is good and offers plenty on top of being updated consistently.",1
26133,"FINALLY ITS HERE.

Been enjoying this in the beta and its cool to see how much this game has improved over time.

Information could be better laid out, but I think there is enough there to make it a fun, if challenging, TD game for people who are into the genre.

[b]Mega Hero[/b] is an action game in which we save the world by fighting giantesses and their minions. It left me with mixed feelings since the game's concept is good and the 3D graphics and sex scenes are pretty, but the gameplay is rough around the edges. It barely explains what your weapons do or how transformation works, plus your character is a bit clunky when moving while transformed. However, the game is entertaining once you get the hang of it, so check it out if it gets your curiosity, but buy it at a discount since it's also a tad short.",1

As the hours pass and day and night alternate, complete relaxation unfolds in your body and mind.

[h1] Review [/h1]

[h2]‚úíÔ∏è Overview [/h2]
Dungeon ‚àû Create is a quite short game (shorter than one hour) that tries to mix a tower defense with dungeons, monsters and sex to create a solid gameplay, but which unfortunately disappoints you, limiting this ‚Äú gameplay ‚Äù to only one strategy that always wins out over the others. Although it has good art and uncensored sex scenes (if you download the external patch), it does not end up being entertaining or exciting at all.

[h3]üìú Story[/h3] 
The story is totally focused on the introduction of the game, telling you how the main character, a person who was sent to an isekai at the request (obligation) of a succubus, ends up as the master of a dungeon. In which he has to manage, distribute traps, place monsters, etc. And the only dialog or lines of text there are during the game are congratulatory sentences from the succubus to the main character for overcoming the ""hordes of adventurers"" and little introductions to the girls the MC has kidnapped for sex. And that is basically the whole story, with no plot to follow and just random dialog, without even an ending, as it ends subtly.

[h3]üéÆ Gameplay[/h3] 
This section should be one of the most remarkable, since in theory the game is about designing a dungeon as strong as possible so that the adventurers do not pass, where you place poison traps, spikes or a variety of enemies such as goblins, demons, bats, minotaur, etc. In the style of a tower defense game. In addition to this, there is also the possibility to unlock new paths for the adventurers to deviate and take them more time to overcome, thus trying to expand the ""complexity"" of the title. But unfortunately, all these mechanics end up being useless because the game is not balanced at all and to overcome ""ALL"" levels you simply place a goblin at the entrance of the dungeon and spend all the upgrade points to level up this goblin, making it practically invincible, eliminating any strategic or playable element, reducing everything to pressing the Ctrl key to see how you ""overcome"" the levels.

[h2]üîûSexual content[/h2]
[h3]* You need to install the external patch from the official publisher 072 project store.[/h3]
The game has only 3 sex scenes, these have no censorship, so you can see the genitals of the girls clearly, besides the art quality of these scenes is good. The scenes also have decent quality motion animation, but no voice acting or SFX.
In terms of genres or fetishes, they are all non-consensual sex, with loss of virginity and big breasts. Since there are so few of them, there is very little variety and it is difficult to satisfy all tastes.
The game has a scene gallery, so once you have unlocked a scene, you can always watch it again.

[h2]üí≠Conclusion[/h2]
I know that the game tells you that it will be short, plus its price of 3 dollars is not very high, so if it was well done it would be a decent recommendation, but the problem is that it is not, you can break the playable system very easily due to the little balancing of the units, it takes away all the sense to the game and makes it boring to play, besides that it is totally repetitive, the game also has some bugs, such as freezes when you kill a monster, or that sometimes the life of some monsters increases instead of decreasing, making the game even easier to overcome. As for the sexual content, it is not bad, but the number of scenes is very low, at least double the number of scenes would be adequate for the price of the game and the last thing I dislike the most about the game is its ""ending"", since it basically tells you that you will not get any more sexual events, but you can continue ""playing"", making it seem like an incomplete game, with this anticlimactic ending.
I really can't recommend to buy this game, because even for 3 dollars it's not worth it, if they fix the game solving the bugs and balancing the units, only in that case you could consider buying this game, or also if you see it at a price even more reduced like 1 dollar or dollar and a half, otherwise a hard pass, there are better games for this price, even games from the same developer.

26152,"I thought the game had an interesting concept. However there is too much randomness to the whole thing and it really encourages reloading saves.

You also can't load saves until after the enemy dies, so if you get an unlucky 2k hp opponent in round 4 you just have to wait for them to kill you to reload the save. Enemy HP is completely random and the DP they reward is so I ended up saving after every round and reloading until I got something that didn't kill half my creatures and awarded a decent amount of DP. 20 rounds in, not a single girl yet on another run I got the first girl at like round 5.",0

The protagonist wakes up in a cavern, greeted by a lazy fallen angel who declares him the new master of a dungeon. Tasked with building and managing the dungeon, the protagonist must defend against adventurers seeking to plunder its treasures. The narrative unfolds through interactions with the fallen angel and various adventurers, each with their own motivations and backgrounds.

The story is straightforward, focusing on the protagonist's journey to become a competent dungeon master while dealing with the mischievous fallen angel. The game incorporates mature themes, adding an erotic twist to the narrative as players unlock explicit scenes by defeating female adventurers.

Character interactions are minimal but provide context to the dungeon management and defense gameplay. The fallen angel serves as a guide and occasional antagonist, adding humor and personality to the story. The adventurers, while not deeply developed, offer varied challenges and rewards, keeping the gameplay engaging.

""Dungeon ‚àû Create"" is an engaging tower defense RPG that excels in strategic gameplay and features mature themes. Despite its limited number of explicit scenes and some minor technical issues, it offers a visually pleasing experience with high-quality CGs and semi-animated sequences. Nikukyu's distinctive art style adds a unique charm, making the game appealing to fans of their work.

For enthusiasts of similar titles like ""Dungeon's Legion"", ""Suzukuri Dungeon: Karin in the Mountain"", or ""Two Months of Devil King"", the content may seem sparse, especially in terms of erotic scenes. However, the game provides enough challenge and entertainment to keep players engaged for several hours. Considering its more than affordable price, ""Dungeon ‚àû Create"" offers excellent value and is a worthy addition to any tower defense lover's collection.

In summary, ""Dungeon ‚àû Create"" is recommended for its strategic depth, appealing art style, and unique blend of tower defense mechanics with mature themes. It provides a short yet enjoyable experience, especially at such a low price, perfect for fans of the genre.

Adventures just take random paths, you can't extend your maze because there is no where to add rocks to keep adventures from taking the shortest route. Traps last forever but monsters need to be re-bought and upgraded so you just put a bunch of traps down and hope the RNG strength adventures step on them multiple times.

[b]Dungeon ‚àû Create[/b] is a short puzzle game in which the protagonist is set up by a lazy succubus to manage a dungeon's defenses so she can feast on their energy without lifting a finger. The gameplay is decent and consists of setting up traps and monsters that keep those pesky adventurers away from stealing the dungeon's core and capturing the few female warriors who get inside the dungeon. Moreover, beating each foe rewards you with DP points you spend on more traps and units or leveling up your monsters, and you get a sex scene if you defeat any of the three female enemies that come to the dungeon.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3292059075
Visuals-wise, the game shares the same detailed and polished art other Nikukyu's games like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikkunamesu/recommended/2395680/]Unyielding Succubus Princess of Arrogance[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikkunamesu/recommended/2499670/]Idol Cultivation Process: Unspoken Rules ‚òÖ„Éü[/url] have. However, the sex scenes are very few, given that each female adventurer only has one scene.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3292059088
[b]Dungeon ‚àû Create[/b] also has a few issues here and there that impact the experience, such as the slime's stats not showing up properly or losing your newest units when you lose after beating the first female adventurer. Still, it's a decent game to get at a discount and play whenever you have a few minutes to spare.

26158,"Pro:
1. CG quality is nice
2. Translation is decent
3. TD (?)

Con:
1. Too simple, you can finish the game within an hour.
2. Control is quite annoying
3. Only 3 sets of CG

All you need to do is spent all your money to make as much as spike traps you  (and put 1 or 2 goblin at back).
You don't even need to move rocks to adjust the route.
Once you have a line of spike traps, you can upgrade your goblin states to level 100 (the upgrade applies to all same name unites, so it is highly recommended to focus on a specific monster).

The game has a lot of potential... currently, the game is lack of content.....I guess it won't have DLCs or expansions to enrich the content :(

26178,"I'd always been a fan of the slide puzzles from the Legendary Mahjong games, so it's nice to see the game mode release in its own title with over 90 new puzzles to work through. And let me tell ya, the puzzles ain't messin' around this time. The difficulty has significantly increased, but so has the tedium of slowly working through each board. Still, clearing each stage feels like an achievement when you've been boggling over just how in the heck you're going to avoid getting pieces stuck over and over again. Fortunately, if you're TOO stuck, video walkthroughs are available in the game itself to help you through, but I prefer to puzzle them out myself. That said, puzzle fans will definitely want to check this one out. But if you're looking for something a little more casual, the Legendary Mahjong games may be a better option for ya.

26179,"Looking at my Post Office Box in front of my Lair.
Oh, HH-GAMES visited me again.
What have we got here?
Another LEGENDARY Game!
Very nice, i love those Series.

So welcome to LEGENDARY SLIDE!

Do you know LEGENDARY MAHJONG 1 and 2?
Yes? Then you will feel very, VERY familar with this Game.
Because it felt a little bit like it is fallen out LEGENDARY PART 2.
You don¬¥t know them? Okay then follow me.

LEGENDARY SLIDE is a Mahjong Game. 
In Mahjong you have to make Pairs to solve them.
Normally you click on both ones and they vanished.
Here it is different.
Here you have to move them to side by side to solve them.
Sounds easy? Oh no it isn¬¥t.
What easy starts, will get harder and harder because of obstacles and other things.
It is not just moving, it is also thinking and sometimes you are stucked.
But don¬¥t panic, every Level has also a Video Guide, if needed.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032792940

Solving over 90 Levels will give you points to raise your Character in Ranks, what will give more motivation.
There is not really a big Story, just save the Temple of Air.
The Graphics are very nice, the Gameplay is wonderfull fluid and the music is amazing ...... again.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032792701 

Well LEGENDARY SLIDE feels like ... no IS exactly like LEGENDARY MAHJONG 2 (LM2). While LM2 got 7 Game Modes,
LEGENDARY SLIDE is one of them. It may be a little bit confusing because here on Steam LEGENDARY SLIDE came out after LM2.
You should know that this Game came out in 2017 and LM2 in 2022 if i remember right, so LEGENDARY SLIDE is not a half Game, LM2 
is the new upgraded Version of it with much more Game Modes, which i HIGHLY recommend, because for me it is the best Mahjong out there.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032793145

So, yes! I recommend LEGENDARY SLIDE because the Game Mode is pure Fun. I love the Levels and i took my Time beating them, not using 
the Video Guides. The Price is absolutly okay for the Playtime and Fun you get. 

Thanks again, dear Dev, i really love this Game.
Hope to see more in the Future.

And thank YOU for reading.

26180,"[b]legendary slide[/b] is a mahjong-based sliding game from 2016. gotta move individual pieces around until they can meet, match and disappear. it's just like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1070250/]notes[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1501090]yin yang[/url] on steam but there are probably other examples that escape me at the moment.

[b]93 levels[/b] unlocked one by one, divided into numerous packs within numerous packs. optional animated [b]tutorials[/b] teach the rules over and over, as the same one plays before every single level. can be turned off but then you might miss new info later. because of course there are [b]various mechanics[/b], not always explained, so I guess you won't be missing anything. not a huge deal, leaves something to find out for yourself. ice tiles are static, sand disappears if conditions are met, locks need keys, there are portals, arrow tiles, 'hidden' ones that need clicking to reveal for a second what they are, etc.

controls are mouse-based, work as they should, esc brings up the pause menu, no other hotkeys. [b]no timer or move limit[/b], just a [b]3-star rating system[/b] based on the number of matches. remove everything for a perfect rating but [b]the final pair to finish the level with only gets revealed (randomly from the remaining tiles) after reaching 2 stars, so it's impossible to finish any level with a single star[/b]. what's the point of the whole system then?

there's a counter for remaining tiles and a toggle to show movable ones. [b]what's missing is a next level button[/b] on the level complete screen, continue just drops you back at level select where there aren't level previews or numbers, so that isn't done well either.

so far so good enough but [b]no undo in a sliding game is a total dealbreaker[/b], made even worse here by [b]no reset button[/b] either. have to bring up the menu and do it there, then wait a bit until things slowly reset.

since it's the [b]platinum edition[/b], not only does it come with more levels (only 84 in the butchered version on big fish), but [b]video solutions are available for every stage[/b], turning a 100 mb game into 1 gb. there's a seek bar and pause button, good stuff, but [b]since the final tiles are randomly chosen, the solution might not work 100%[/b], e.g. if it shows to match 2 tiles next that became finishers in your game. the walkthrough selection screen has layout previews and level numbers at least, and [i]that[/i] has a dedicated button on the ui while playing too. there are possibly other extras, unlocked after completing the main levels, which I didn't bother with the way the game works.

it [b]looks exactly like the developer's other mahjong titles[/b], same menus, ui, tiles, everything. possibly the same audio as well, can't confirm that. customization options are pretty good though, backgrounds, tilesets, tile shapes and colors. separate volume sliders, game cursor and windowed mode make up the settings, available anytime, plus there are player profiles.

would be a fine little game despite all the recycled assets (just look at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/701290/]legendary mahjong[/url], which also has slide levels that may or may not differ from the ones here, lots more content for about the same price), but as said above, [b]no undo means it can't be recommended[/b]. bummer.",0

- the mop bucket physics interactions are INSANE - turn them down please lol",1

While being a single player experience and thereby skipping out on the potential shenanigans and tomfoolery available in it's inspirational granddaddy game, the depth added via the storyline mode and what clearly will be a series of connected experiences couples wonderfully with all the gadgets available to you.

For those of you criminally unaware of [b]Viscera[/b], the premise there was you are a cleaner tasked with removing the detritis left behind after a [i]Computer Game Hero[/i] blows through a level (Doom, Shadow Warrior, etc.). In this world, you are a contract cleaner for the shady. Think Mob hits that need to not be known to have happened.
[list]
[*] The method of tool usage are excellent. Very intuitive and neat, with no annoying hassles.
[*] Location(s) are very cool, with detailed realism and immersion
[*] Voice acting and plotline (from what we see) are top tier
[*] The ""moreish"" aspect is immediate. While the Demo/Prologue is just the right length to expose you to things, it does leave you wanting a bit more!
[/list]

All in all, a complete mini game as a demo, that will very clearly depict to you if this is your cup of tea or not. Take note big Developers and follow suit!

26189,"Really enjoyed the demo.
A nice cross between House Flipper and Viscera Cleanup Detail without the things that exhaust me about both (I enjoy them but I always hit some point in a level where I'm just tired of being there - for House Flipper it's mostly after the cleanup, I have no interest in decorating, and for Viscera the levels are sometimes just to big to solo and the controls are purposely finicky (part of it's charm, but sometimes I just want the satisfaction of cleaning).

Crime Scene Cleaner is a nice chill time. Cleaning is satisfying and fast enough to not feel tedious (no need to go over the same area several times like Powerwash), and I enjoy repairing things and putting them back. Also Bless this game for letting me pick up multiple pieces of garbage at once.

It'll definitely scratch enough of an itch until someone finally gives me another game like Unpacking.",1
26190,"It's a combination of visceral cleanup detail + thief simulator. Not too bad of a concept. Would be better if there's an indication on where the blood stains are at. Spent a lot of time running around the whole floor with the UV light trying to locate the remaining 2% blood stains, which was pretty frustrating. End up I just start scrubbing everywhere randomly. Would love it more if there's co-op.",1
26191,"I am an avid fan of [i]Viscera Cleanup Detail[/i] so as soon as I saw the store page of this game I decided to download it immediately. If you have played [i]Thief[/i] then this game will be somewhat familiar in the sense that you are not out cleaning on official business but this is a 2nd job you have since with your janitorial salary you barely make ends meet. Plus, medical bills are especially high for a certain family member. Yeah, well, we won't get fond of this game because of the story.

Your home serves as a hub area where the computer we access to pick up missions. It's nice looking around in your apartment and interacting with everything you can (including your dog). You hop into your car and you'll find yourself on scene and you can immediately start cleaning. Now, the game says ""prologue"" but the mission details mention this is the 6th one. I assume they included a later level to showcase that several items available at your disposal to do the cleaning. You also notice that apart from the cleaning you can collect (steal) money, jewelry and other items, plus, you have several skill trees you can look at (but in this ""demo"" buying and assigning skill points is not possible). Oh, and you can also collect (remove) evidence that the cops would otherwise find (including erasing camera footage).

The basic concept is identical to that of [i]Viscera[/i]: get a bucket full of water and use your mop to clean every surface. Your mop requires cleaning and your bucket needs fresh water after a while. In [i]Viscera[/i] accidentally kicking (and tipping over) your bucket was possible but here I didn't notice such a thing. Also, bigger levels would be better so that a friend could join you but, sadly, this will remain a single player game. First, you are outside then you go inside and beside the ground floor and first floor you also have to do the cleaning in the basement. Taps for the bucket are always close so this won't be an issue.

Now, the interesting part is how you need to collect broken pieces of glass or bullets. Anything you break if you don't pay attention will be added to the amount of trash you need to dispose of. Once your trash bin is full your character can produce a sac. The game favours a casual approach and every equipment is easy-to-use and you don't feel stuck. Multiple sacs can be combined and disposing bodies is the easiest since you just have to pick them up. The back of your truck automatically applies the body bags. You can also hold left click to ensure multiple pieces of broken glass can be picked up quickly and efficiently.

There's more! A power washer for surfaces outside, a sponge for the same on the inside since a mop would break objects close to blood stains. Sponges are for a more careful, more meticulous cleaning exercise. You can apply detergents to the water to ensure stains disappear more quickly or that your mop lasts longer. Now, cleaning is not just about making everything spotless - remember it's about pretending nothing happened. So, all pieces of furniture must be put back to their original place. Locations are highlighted when you get closer - otherwise use your special crime sense to find out where everything belongs and if statistical data says a room is 99% clean only your sense will highlight that missing 1%. 

In [i]Viscera[/i], a special item provided audio cues so searching for every piece of stain towards the endgame was a challenge. Plus, no statistical data was provided while performing the job. In fact, here you can get percentage values per location. Again, [i]Crime Scene Cleaner[/i] leans towards a more casual playerbase. But this is fine! And while cleaning you can listen to music and your protagonist has some one-liners when spotting a new dead body. These remarks are actually pretty funny.

This prologue lasts for an hour or so. I look forward to the full game! I think [i]Viscera[/i] and / or [i]Thief[/i] fans will like it! I didn't include all pieces of equipment we can use in this demo so feel free to find out!",1
26192,"It's all about cleaning up after the mafia's dirty work but it's way more fun than it sounds.

Interactive gameplay just keeps you on playing, the gritty atmosphere really adds into the environment.

It's not even a full game yet but I enjoyed my time playing it ;)

If you're into cleaning-type of games, you should definitely give this a try <3",1
26193,"Very nice games about cleaning. It is totally not stressed inducing. I will certainly play the full version. 

Buckets are your enemies. Do not trust them.",1
26194,"Honestly pretty fun and well made. I was too dumb to remember to use the detergent and ozonator, but all they do is expedite the process slightly. I love that there is a specific time and place for the power washer, the mop, and the sponge.


Also, you can pet the dog, 10/10.",1
26195,"A cleaning game with a story, good voice acting. Hope that you can upgrade your tools along the way through an online shop or something and not just through a skill tree. Would've been cool to drive the car in the city too and dispose of everything for extra cash.

Comparing the demo from a few months ago with this version I can say that there's many changes. 

""The level design itself has been altered in some places. Kovalsky, the playable character, got new voice acting and there are also some smaller improvements, UI changes and more features available.""",1
26196,"The graphics were amazing! In such a little demo I was intrigued in the further development of the story and further missions, I will be waiting on the full release of the game. (the added choice in music while cleaning was such a simple touch yet I really enjoyed it, oddly enough very relaxing)",1
26197,Awesome Game! Its as smooth as the beta. I cant Wait for the official release. The voice acting  is amazing!. This game gives me Power Wash sim and Viscera cleaner.,1
26198,"Game is great, i would like to pick up the pizza boxes and the wine bottles as trash. love the achievement when you make a ball on the net. didn't crash or had drops on fps cannot wait for the full game release,.",1
26199,Really wanted to play this.. but will not load when i press new game goes to a black screen then cuts out :(,0
26200,"I enjoyed the experience of the game. The Prologue was just enough of a show for me - captivating story, snarky comments of our main character, good graphics of the house and just the kind of gameplay I enjoy - cleaning a house that isnt mine!",1
26201,"This game is great!! very enjoyable and interesting with detail of a bit of story line, if you look. Definitely buying later on, and I pray its possibly co-op my friends would love this game!!! 11/10",1
26202,"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, but it was super, super fun. The only things I would change for the final game are:
1. Being able to call your objects back to you. I had one of my buckets glitch through the wall in the bathroom on the upper floor, and end up being on an unreachable balcony/awning thing. Super lucky they included a second bucket in the inventory, or I would have had to restart. Had to leave it behind, though.
and 2: Enabling like a ""hint"" option, maybe? Took me a little bit to find the last blood splatter on the upper floor, so i was at 98% for a while and couldn't find the last bit- Ended up being a hand print on the railing not close to any other blood stains.
I really enjoy also that this looks like its going to have an ongoing story line and characters, though! That kind of shakes it up from similar(ish) games like House Flipper where you just...fix and clean things.

ALSO, maybe the most important part- You CAN in fact pet the dog.",1
26203,"I though this is going to be just a normal simulator, but its actually chill, kinda reminds me of old capcom mystery games back in the 2000's, also its this is a chill vibe game that is well executed overall mechanics. Props also to the pop culture refrerences.",1
26204,"I really enjoyed this game, it was both satisfying and eerily creepy and that is my vibe.

The main character is funny, The cleaning doesn't feel too tedious and the bits of story you can find about each crime keep you interested. 

I would definitely recommend trying it out!",1
26205,Viscera clean-up detail mixed with power wash sim. My only gripe is how hard this game runs. It does run smooth but my pc was screaming the whole time and I have decent air flow and a modern GPU. Other than that I would recommend this and the full game when it releases.,1
26206,Fun game with so far a very interesting backstory. Great for when you've got some time to kill and want to just relax. Perfect balance of crude humor and dark jokes while not coming off as edgy or forced. Protagonist has a genuine motive and a personality that is both intriguing as well as makes him entertaining. Can't wait for the next release to find out more about his story.,1
26207,Honestly I cannot wait until the full game drops. Very similar to Viscera Cleanup with some nice adjustments and dog petting action. Has a nice brief intro as to why you're cleaning up with many tools to use and skills to gain to help improve those tools and unlock other features. Give it a whirl and make the scene look nice and clean.,1
26208,Highly recommended! It has the entertainment and physics of Viscera Clean Up Detail with the low key story telling to keep it engaging as you clean up after a sloppy killer work. I love the subtle nods to other crime shows and the vocal responses to what you discover is enjoyable and well done. I am looking forward to the full game. Dexter approved!,1
26209,"it was way fun and well made than I expected, can't wait for the full game to release.  If you have 2h to spare just go ahead and play it-",1
26210,"Spectacular game! Had some performance issues but apart from that the game is stuning:

- Good Graphics;
- Appealing UI;
- Accurate & immersive scennery;
- Lore is interesting & captivating;
- Gameplay is smooth and easy to understand;

9/10, was left wishing for at least a 2nd mission after the 1st one or else I'd give It a 10 :)",1
26211,"This seems promising. Once I managed to get in to play (after crashing twice and waiting forever on a loading screen), I fairly enjoyed it. Except for the back-and-forth carrying of trash bags and such, the mechanics are varied and not frustration-inducing. Going for 100% was fairly satisfying. Only thing is, it seemed pretty laggy and my frames took a nosedive everytime I went down the forest path in particular, even when I turned the settings down to low.
It might induce motion-sickness in some people, I was feeling a bit queasy in places and especially at the end running back and forth through a laggy area. Needs optimization, but I do look forward to the full game.",1
26212,"Great Game!! If the full game is as good as the prologue, I'll definitely buy it!",1
26213,"Had a great time playing this, the voice acting is a really nice touch! (Loved the reference made in the basement area).

Can't wait till this gets a full release, instant buy for me!",1
26214,"Thought the game looked interesting so wanted to play the Prologue before I bought the actual game.
However, that being said. I cannot play it. It crashes on the loading screens (I suspect due to the animations on the loading screen from like the fan spinning etc.)
I've tried uninstall/reinstall, play as admin, compatibility mode, etc. No luck.
Seems lots of others have the same issues with crashing even if they make it past the launch.
Based on my personal experience, cannot recommend.",0
26215,"It is really a very detailed game and the graphics are also very realistic .But I feel the props are not very much and there is not a lot of fear.Finally ,I hope it can make more plots and chapters and not sell too expensive.",1
26216,"very fun experience, if you like games like viscera cleanup detail and powerwash sim

then im sure you will like this game aswell, loved every second of it <3

bye mark!",1
26217,"The Prologue is already a Good Start into this Game, and its already Wishlisted on my End! Cant wait for the Full Release, 11/10 - would clean again! :D",1
26218,": What I like about the the game 
- The story and what the reason I started the cleaning job and what happened at the crime scene before I cleaned it
  - Funny little comments here and there
  - Easy to collect garbage
  - Nearby water pumps
: What i didn't like 
-  Taking a body or trash bag to the car every time 
- rotate the furniture every time
 Overall it looks like a promising game and I'm looking forward to playing it and I hope they add a co op in the future",1
26219,"make it co-op pls, its too good to play by our own!!! Waiting for the full version to clean more blood and bodies >:)",1
26220,"I loved this game. If you enjoyed Power washing sim you will enjoy this more. It's fun to use different equipment to clean and I kinda liked how sometimes I would make the mess bigger and would have to go back and clean it up, it added a layer of difficulty without it being too much. Overall can't wait till it comes out! It was relaxing and interesting to play <333
Also I need to mention I LOVED that this has a story to it, the character you play has a daughter who is sick and I'm interested to find out if we help get her get the care she needs because she is in the hospital lol 
During the game it gives the option to steal and I sure did just so I can pocket that money for my daughter in the game to pay her hospital bills!",1
26221,"I love this so much! A combination of Vicera Cleanup Detail, House Flipper and Powerwash Simulator that I've always wanted! The dialogue is well done, the mechanics work well (though it can take a bit to get used to), there's a fun sense of humour throughout, and you can pat the dog.

The lighting could use a bit of tweaking, it's a little jagged in some places and even well lit areas are still very dark for what it should be. If a rooms lights are all on, I shouldn't need additional lamps or the flashlight. But that's a gripe I have with many games these days, particularly with games made in Unreal Engine.

All in all, I am excited about a game for a change. Great stuff President Studio S.A

",1
26222,"I am kinda burnt out from games (went too hard with the Elden Ring DLC hahaha), so I was looking for something easy and rewarding to do and this hit the spot PERFECTLY. I really got lost in it, I love the details, love the audio (great voices), and overall just very enjoyable. 

Also, 10/10 can pet the pup! I can't wait for the full release, I hope Markiplier plays this hahaha!",1
26223,"game just keeps crashing either at the begining or when i wake up and move around the apartment every time, it never lets me get far at all in the game ever. sucks cause i really wanted to play.",0
26224,"After years of waiting on this game, it finally has a demo and game play footage! I loved cleaning and the detailed aspects of cleaning! It really takes me back to Viscera Cleanup Detail. Enjoyed the bit of a storyline/objectives. Eagerly waiting on the full release!!",1
26225,"What a masterpiece! I really enjoyed the cleaning. Had some funny puns, the game was a bit laggy sometimes (even though I got a powerful PC), the game has a nice aura to it, lore wise it's interesting, and gameplay wise it's fun and doesn't get boring. It's definitely a game I can see myself playing in the future. 10/10!!!",1
26226,"I love it!! With my OCD brain, I'm literally in love with this game. I want to play the full game already! The attention to small details makes it more realistic, which is the best part. The voice acting is good and funny too. Unfortunately, I often experience FPS drops and lagging on my laptop. Despite that, the game is super cool, and I would buy it no matter the cost.",1
26227,"Wooow nice game ! Want to see how is going in the story :)
I have played games like this (house flipper etc.) but the got boring super quick .
Here is different, have meaning what u doing, not just cleaning and cleaning...
+Nice and calm
+Graphics are good
+Mechanics are good too
+Lots of stuff to do what is amazing

-Sometimes hard to spot the blood stains on objects maybe for just me. (i know u have UV lamp ( nu8 )).

All around really enjoyed this DEMO wished was longer tho !

Keep it up devs !",1
26228,"Real fun game.
I never played any kind of ""cleaner"" games, and this is a pretty darn good start.
The graphics look good, and seemingly same with the plot. I love the fact that each tool is pretty unique.
You can pet the dog (Best part).

The only issue I have about the game is the fact that it can get annoying how much you have to run back to your car to put on it trash bags, in the end I had to run back to the car around 10 times (10 trashbags), which got kinda annoying, I wish the trashbags would be able to hold a little bit more, because it will get annoying when the actual game comes out and I play it.
That's my only issue though, definitely recommending this game.",1
26229,"I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it, really looking forward to the full game.
I appreciated that there was an option to ""sense"" what items needed to be put in what place, the voice acting was PERFECT for our protagonist with just the right amount of sass and morbid jokes, and it was also very nice that we could toggle options between actual blood effects or clown orgy juice everywhere. The ragdoll effect of the bodies was hilarious and most importantly, Doggo Dexter is the absolute best part of the game! Well done!",1
26230,"First off: you can pet the dog and when you turn on the TV there's a show about ducks (with commentary)! That by itself makes it a great game. 

Besides that I loved the prologue. The gameplay is very smooth, voice acting is amazing, love the graphics and just the overall visuals. The fact that you can find lore throughout the house is amazing and the snarky comments from the MC during the cleaning makes it even better. 

Overall I am VERY positive about this game and can't wait for it to be fully released!",1
26231,This game is really good so far and I love how much detail and interactivity was present. There were some bugs here and there ex: getting 100% then it digresses to 99% - but when you finish mission it says 100% completed. I think I spent about an extra 30 minutes trying to get it to 100% until I found someone on the discussion forum with the same problem. The commentary was funny. It reminded me of postal 2.,1
26232,"666 Second Rule is a rather dark themed  mix of a Clicker and Tower Defense game where the player is put in the shoes of a parrent who has to protect its baby from insects crawling into its brain and infecting it. and if that doesnt suit your style you can always beat the living hell out of it instead. It could propably also be argued that the game even though a clicker has some ressemblance to whac- a-mole games as the player has to frantically kill off the insects with various weapons from above.

There are four different weapons varrying from a hammer to 3 different types of slippers and one being the Jesus slippers.
5 different powers that works basically as the tower defense part of the game.

A pretty short indie game and a bit overpriced at 4.99 at its baseprice but for for me who generally isnt too fond of Clickers i had a pretty good time playing it even though its a bit repetitive.

It took me 2.5 hours to 100% the achievements....",1
26233,"Disgustingly well made game!

Sounds is the best thing in the game - all different crunches and this ambient**
I've played it today and will play it even more^^",1

Everyone else is welcome",1

26239,"This game is one very simple concept. That's it. If you're not a very casual gamer, I would recommend passing on this one. 
If you're looking for something like this theme with depth, Try Solar 2 (I would say Solar, but I don't think it's on anything anymore).
This game deserves to get a neutral review because it looks nice, there's obvious care put into the game, and there's a nice feel to it; but it has seemingly no rhyme or reason between becoming the other planets, and the achievements are the only reason to play it past the first winning run. Maybe it's sticking to absorbing specific planets or dark/light asteroids, but I tested this twice and kept getting cracked planets. This doesn't mean that's not the case. Maybe the initial planet is random, and growing it with like planets will make it grow to a bigger version of the same one. 
It's a major lack of content for me, and my rule of thumb on indie games is $1 per hour of content, which this doesn't even have 1 hour of varying engaging playtime. If you look at all the reviews, they didn't play very far past reviewing it, and that's a red flag for me when looking at games. They were all positive though, so it was a bit deceiving.  
This is a single player themed Agar.io with a very low cap that makes you reset the game. There's no missions. There's no advancing the game in different ways. You can't grow to be the biggest thing on the map. You get to a black hole in less than 5 minutes, then you can endless run to continue doing the exact same thing over and over to boost your score. I'm an achievement hunter, so I'll be playing it to get all the other achievements, but I feel like I'm going to be torturing myself by doing as such.
Edit: I realized that multiple achievements are broken and don't unlock... of all the ones I have left: 
I'm not going to try for a higher score when the 15k didn't unlock.
I literally discussed getting cracked planet multiple times in the review before I started hunting and still don't have it. I also got a wasteland planet but that didn't unlock. I'm not exactly sure what the planet destroyer achievement is, but I've ran into them multiple times to try unlocking it and it didn't happen. Now I suggest avoiding the game entirely",0
26240,"Very relaxing game with beautiful visuals. 
The controls are very simple and the game is easy to get in to.
The game can also pose a challenge through it's achievements and endless mode.
Gravity effects in the game are a nice touch and are very well done, as they should be considering the game takes place in space.
Excited to see future updates for this game. I would like to see more ""encounters"" such as world enders added in the latest update, more models, and more visual effects (for example when moving, how fast you are moving, etc.) to name a few. :)",1
26241,Good time killer. Just need to fix the bug where planets and suns spawn on top of you.,1

26247,"I would recommend this product not because it's a triple aaa world changing game of the year but for its simplicity, goofy art and relaxing atmosphere.

26250,"[b]Introduction.[/b] - written for ver 0.12

I usually look at reviews and comments with the hope of getting specific information. With adult games it can be quite difficult do discern what you'll actually get in a game, and when you have some rather particular preferences and deal breakers on the one hand, and not always the most clear information let's say, on store pages or even in answers on the other, it can get pretty frustrating.

So, my goal here is to assure you if needed, or encourage you, to give yourself the chance to enjoy this game if possible.

i will have 3 sections where i attempt to answer the sort of information i myself would like, or things i feel i understand to some degree and also see a lot from others.

Section 1 will speak to those of you who prefer a focus on story and character in your adult games.

Section 2 will speak to those of you who prefer a focus on lewd content, that is to say, not slow burn and a lot of lewd content. 

I myself feel like a mix of both, but i do fall more in the second camp. To my mind the story and characters are vital, and serve roughly to either ruin/allow or enhance the lewd content. Often it is a mix of course.

Section 3 will be more of a list of specific zoom-ins on particular aspects of the adult game. This section will hopefully have something hyper relevant for many of you.


[b]Section 1 - Story people.[/b]

So, this game makes an effort to create a world and stories within it, and characters get a good amount of effort put into them, the downside for story people i believe is that you won't get too deep with a single character, content will be rather spread - which is a weakness *and* strong point of this game - there is a lot of content - stories, character and lewd.

Though i still think there is room in your library for this game, much like there is room in mine for a game like say, Chasing Sunsets. And i believe you will like it, much like in Sunsets quality and effort does shine through.


[b]Section 2 - Lewd Content people.[/b]

I dare say, if you don't have some very particular dislikes or likes you feel you often/ do not often come across in adult games, your reading is over, get the game. There is a lot of variety and options, you will not feel slow burned', You will not be teased and not rewarded, the totality of sex scenes will not be low at all. There *could* be 1 exception to this, with regards to endgame characters, but we don't know yet.


[b]Section 3 - Specific Aspects you may have a concern or hope regarding.[/b]

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

Yes, this is actually a game as well. I found it a perfect way to enhance the lewd content, it feels like earning it. There are in-built cheats you can use if so inclined, but it is pretty intuitive and fun in my view. The only note i'll add is the first time you play, don't be super tired and give yourself some room to tinker. I'd also recommend using more than 1 save ( i use 2 ).

[b]Love interests & the Harem:[/b]

There will basically be 3 types of Love interests - Main Girls ( wenches/rulers ), Strong side girls ( harlots ) and side girls.

The main girls will be, if you so chose, your harem. And it's not one of those it's called a harem  and then you find out that it's more like an open relationship where you have no say. It's also a harem in that they know and are okay with one another - not that they have too much of a choice ( depending on *your* choices ). 
The strong side girls are side girls that are also part of your harem - if you so chose - , you meet them in infiltration quests.
The side girls are the same as the strong side girls, with the exception that they cannot be made a part of your harem ( some of them might be in future though ).

[b]NTR ( Netorare ):[/b]

This is a very chill topic to cover where we all use it to mean the same thing ( Joke! ).
But, it is of course important and a big worry for many. I will be using ntr here colloquially to mean things like other men messing with your Love Interests. Also to be clear, i am particular about it and have no room in my... simulated erotic adventures for '' other men ''. So, for those of you somewhat like me, the answer is NO, you will not get *or* feel like you got ntr'd.

The only thing even approaching it might be some *information* ( and maybe an optional event ) regarding a race of people called elfkin, they are all promiscuous like rabbits essentially. but also so far only a couple of side girls.
 
There is *some* very optional sharing, that can mean a lot of things, i know, so let me assure you that it is in the form of you having complete control AND never in the ntr-feeling of the woman wants it and says/does things to that effect and THEN you get the option to say no. It's more in the form of you have to introduce it yourself. I never felt '' ugh wtf '' and i'm rather particular about this.


[b]Climaxing Options:[/b]

You will almost always get at least 2 choices, whether it's a bj, vaginal or anal. That does not mean two versions of auto pullout, that means '' come inside '' or pull out in some fashion.

I cannot stress enough how much i appreciate this aspect of this game. Even for bj's, the corner is not cut. 
Also, climaxes are almost always some version of an ON SCREEN event, it doesn't cut away - it happens. 

There are exceptions and degrees to this, but i'm maximally particular with climaxing options *and* it being an ON SCREEN event. This game SHINES with this, not much corner cutting at all. 


[b]Pregnancy and Impregnation:[/b]

If there is any aspect you enjoy regarding the impregnation side or showing and pregnant side, you will likely love this game, or at the very least this part of it. The game SHINES here. 

[b]Forced and optional content:[/b]

The good news is i *think* you can avoid pretty much any sexual encounter so you may pick and choose to your hearts content.
Though saying no to a love interest may lock out future content with her later.

The bad news are that within a choice or branch there will sometimes be things you might not like. There were things i ran into that felt like an option would make sense. But, this game is so rich in content, it really can afford it, it rarely had much of a negative impact on me. So however your preferences and mine might differ or align , i'm confident most of you like me, will be more than pleased. 


[b]Sound:[/b]

This game uses music composed for this game specifically which does a lot for ambiance and immersion - way above the average adult game experience.

The use of moaning during lewd events currently ( ver 0.12 ) comes in 3 categories.
High quality only female moaning.
No sound/no sound yet.
And, the famous porn sounds i'm sure most of you are familiar with. Where the quality is low *and*  almost always it includes male moaning. Now, this is likely to be improved on - but even if it isn't, or isn't enough for some of us, there is an easy toggle for just sex sounds. And while the nice moaning does add flavor, this game really does not *need* it according to me.

[b]Repeatable & Animation:[/b]

Another thing that makes this game shine for me, is repeatable lewd events with all of your harem members. INCLUDING repeatable impregnation and pregnancy. Some scenes have animation and more will in future.

[b]Last Comments:[/b]

Something that should be mentioned is the quality of the erotic writing during lewd scenes, it is present and excellent, the game SHINES here. The *only* big letdown i had with this game was something relating to variety and options with a Main girl couple, but i suspect most main girls will get more things added to their repeatable scenes.

My hope is this helped encourage or assure you to try the game, I truly believe Vae Victis - Khan deserves to be considered one of the great adult games, and I don't think you'll regret getting this game.

26253,"In my opinion, it's an overall good game and has a lot of content for an early access. If it wasn't for the rock, paper, scissors dumb ass combat rng system, I would 100% recommend this. I honestly don't even see the point in the combat other than to annoy the hell out of you with save scumming ruining the overall experience of an otherwise really fun game. Thumbs up though, with the hopes the combat will be reworked/removed or otherwise avoidable later before full release.",1
26254,"Great game, tons of sex, i really loved it ! Very good graphics, in the sex scenes and in the surroundings. The story is well written with some surprising twists and turns. The hero is not only a lover but also a breeder, that is rare in these kind of games, well done ! The personal combat system is average, the army combat system needs improvement. Good options screen. I would love to see more of this developer !",1
26255,"This game is being released in Early Access. That means that the game may, or may not, change from its current state. It has been in development since July of 2020 and is expected to be in Early Access for two to three years.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Vae Victis Khan is a RenPy adventure game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You've spent four years, locked in a cell. A dirt floor, stone bed, and a bucket for your bodily functions is all you've had. Even after four years, you don't know why you're here.

Four years ago you returned home from the Academy, in the spring. You went to the seamstress' home. You had shared her bed with her and her daughters and were wondering if they would be pregnant when you walked into the house. Instead the Shadow Guard were waiting for you outside her house. You fought with them, annoyed that they would attempt to arrest a prince. You killed one guard, but the rest overwhelmed you and you've been in this cell ever since.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game starts off by allowing you to limit fetishes you do not have an interest. Even if you have a fetish enabled, it will normally be optional. You will also set your pubic hair preferences, hairy or trimmed.

Next up you set your name, Karder by default.

Combat is a rock, scissors, paper system. One of my least favorite games to play, especially if your opponent uses a truly random tactic. In addition to the rock, scissors, and paper you can choose a normal, defensive, or aggressive stance. On the plus side, it seems that the opponent attacks are scripted. Goblins, for example will always parry (rock), so if you always use slash (scissors) you will win. Normal attacks do normal damage, Aggressive attacks do double damage, Defensive attacks do one point of damage, but mitigate your opponent's incoming damage. The basic strategy is to stick with Defensive attacks until you determine your opponent's pattern. I would advise saving at the start of each fight also, as a loss ends the game. You just need to survive the fight, your hit points will be refilled the next time you need to fight. So, there is no need in playing until you win unscathed.

When you have an option that will include a scene, that information is part of the prompt selection.

There are a number of quests where you need to explore an area. In the upper right is your map, so that you can ensure you do not run around in circles. There are also city maps. In the upper right corner is an hour glass, this changes the time from day to night, for when your quest requires you to be at a location as a different time of day.

After a brief introduction, you encounter the tutorial on kingdom building. You can limit the kingdom building portion of the game by using the VN Mode in the options. Additionally, Army vs Army combat is normally automatic, but you can toggle it to a more detailed system in the options. Next you are shown what the more detailed system looks like.

I would recommend the VN Mode. I played the kingdom building mode and conquest is severely limited. You start with 30 troops and you have a troop cap of 20 troops per conquered territory, plus 10. Where this is an issue is that early on your territories are attacked by neighboring territories and you can lose obedience. The only way to increase obedience is to station 30 troops in the territory, which you can only do for one territory at a time. But, that's not where it is really an issue. The real issue is when you want to attack another territory, you really only have 10 troops to spare. In order to attack a territory you have to remove the troops from most, if not all, of your territories into the mobile military. Then after the battle you can move them back. Except for the fact you will lose troops, so you have to wait for them to be trained. The way the game is set up you have to follow a basic path as you won't have enough troops available until you conquer a territory with a smaller army.

The art varies from stills to lightly animated to fully animated, with the majority being stills or lightly animated. The quality of the animations varies from scene to scene, some are smooth, others not so much.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
The Gallery is accessed from the Scene gallery option on the title menu. There are ten different sections, broken down by territory, with Interludes as the final section. There are at least nine scenes per territory, some have as many as 21. You can only view scenes that you have viewed in the game. They play the same as they did in the game.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A decent game, with dated looking art. The art is plentiful, over 200 scenes to unlock. Heavy breeding and pregnancy content.

26256,"The gameplay is long and redundant considering the reason people buy these games.   The storyline is rich if you just want the ""visual novel"" but if you want to see the sex, you will find the animations quite underwhelming compared to other games of similar genre.   The style is a bit crude and tasteless too, focusing on ""forced encounters"" and even beastiality.   Artwork is mediocre at best, most of the models, particularly the ""milfs"" are not very attractive and most ""scenes"" don't even have an actual animation.   I would recommend moving on to another adult visual novel that has better content and more actual animations.",0
26257,"I thought the game was good and worth the cost for time I enjoyed it.  The plot is decent.  The combat and strategy is odd but not bad for AVN.  The best part for me was how the game felt unique for each territory and that each ""zone"" didn't feel like a repeat story.  I did really like that you could chose the fate of the characters.  I look forward to future updates as the game is really enjoyable in my opinion!",1
26258,for a Early Access game its exceptionally impressive. The renders are great and the tactic side is also very good and also challenging. A paper and pin at times to remember stuff but I find that adds to it as well. A few choices are a hard call at times on how you play the game and I look forward to the next chapter/update.,1
26259,"the Good. this game is good overall, the value is good, the sex scenes are mostly good, the story is good also.
the Bad, for me the combat was 'clunky' and just not fun. 
The resource  management was not fun, 
For me. the combat system would have been a game breaker for me, but thankfully there is a way to auto win and not mess with the combat system. 
The resource  management  would not have broken the game for me, but not having to play that part is also a win for me.
in spite of some minor issues; this is a solid game I will play again if more content is released in the next version. 
",1
26260,"Would buy. the graphics are okay ish, It's clear the dev have tried toying with new ideas, like voiced scenes and such, and results are... okay. The dev is only a small indie, so there's that. But it has potential. The concept is really good, quite rare actually (which I find surprising). So this is a good go, and a must have for those into certain niches.",1
26261,"I normally watch reviews and wait for a sale to buy new games. In the case of Vae Victis - Khan, I was so intrigued by what I read and saw that I was hooked. Even the negative reviews said look at the game online and it looked great. So I bought it at full price. Since playing your game I have been surprised just how excellent it is in all areas and how much care you have given to make it the best experience and play it your way. This is the best AVN and developer that I have come across. I had a ""bug"" which turned out to be player error. I didn't see the cursor prompting me to hit enter. The game gave me a choice to change a name and I couldn't get the game to progress. It was late Friday night. I went on discord for help and members sent a message to doorknob22. In minutes he was online and helping me in person. This is a small indy developer doing all of this himself and yet the excellence and quality show through everywhere. You can tell this is his passion and he takes pride in his work. The main character is a real bastard in the game. The developer is a class act. Usually it is the other way around.",1
26262,"What can I say about this thing...

First of all this thing can be called a ""game"" as it's not just a cilck to skip matter. It is not complete at this time, let's say it's 50% or about 50% done. The story is decent even if you have to read tons of lines too keep up.
The illustrations and animations are decent too even if sometimes cut by the UI placing the reading text on the lower screen where frequently happens the main ""focus"" is placed too, causing some auto-censorship. So the UI, all and all, could have been done better.

The game is filled with kinks for all tastes: incest, being a control freak, bestiality... Among them all, the main principal ones are pregnancy and voluptuous-chubby huge-breast and huge-butts women. Sadly both not my thing but I won't judge kinks here. Told so, it comes by itself that is a man-sausage focus game: you are a prince enjoying conquering lands and building up your reign (tactical part) while ""filling the unprotected womb"" (sorry bit this ""unprotected womb"" is really a laugh) belonging to mainly each single and always willing woman you met (sexual part).

Usually in these kind of games I give my Character a silly name. This time I named him ""Idiot Male"" and all the lines became even more funny to read. Just try it: it's a certified laugh to tears.

Is it worth 20 buks? Honeslty no: 10 would have been enough, so wait for Steam sales as i did.

Enjoy!",1
26263,"Sorry, but I can't get past the book sorting, I don't have time and there is no hint of getting anything right, so I'm done. Tried to look up help, and nothing. the game is ok but all the in games are not practical. If you get more out of it then good for you, but I had a hard time from the start.",1
26264,"The combat system is flat out tedious and annoying, and activating VN mode to disable it does not work so it simply destroys the game in it's entirety. If it were not for the combat system this looks to have the makings of an ok VN but at this point I will waste no more time on it.",0
26265,"Yes, to the victor goes the spoils! It's good to be the KHAN! Yes, there are grammar errors and word errors, hopefully they will fix it. Otherwise the game is fun.",1
26266,"Thoroughly impressed. It has the best gameplay options such as skipping combat (or not depending on preference), same with skipping mini quests. Having the option makes the game more playable. The roughness options are also naturally in line with what one would expect a khan to do.",1
26267,"awesome writing, great world building graphics is great in variety but is understandably not AAA level. Most of the lewd scenss are animated but early ones are not. dev says he will fix this soon so three's that. A real surprise was the music! Didn't expect to find such a high quality score in porn game! The music really helps telling the different places apart and gives them a diferent flavor. all in all if you want a well thought and well executed adult-only fantasy conquest game, you can't go wrong with this one. Oh, and I bought the OST, well worth the money.",1
26268,its all around fun and enjoyable. do you wish to have your own harem and be at war with other areas like back in time? then you will enjoy this! its got plenty of strategy options as well.,1
26269,"The early access game story is good and have plenty of animations , interesting  game but full of bug and errors . Very irritating to stay on the game . Hope it will be rectified ASAP by DEV.",1
26270,Loved this game although there are some minor things that I didn't like. For example the rock paper scissor battle system. Like its just saving and then going back unless you want to be defensive for 10 turns until you find their attack pattern. Another thing was the fiefdom Geoyanguk's quest. Like seriously it was just a bad quest in general unlike the other quests it made the dude sound like a complete idiot and its leader didn't really give me any sort of emotion unlike the other leaders apart from confusion that is. All in all i'd suggest skipping this specific quest but definitely do all the other ones. It is well worth it,1
26271,"This is a great game!  It has even greater potential.
Don't care for the combat system though, but I see the devs say they are working on the Army battles.
It would be even better if you could create your own character.
And it had a woman's storyline as the main character
The quest and storyline are very well written.
be looking forward to added content and features.",1
26272,"play as a seductive prince or as a psychopathic b******, based on your choices. enjoy kingdom management or relax and play with basically easy mode{max gold max loyalty etc} and enjoy the story{ and the decent sex scenes with both still and animated scenes}. recommend.",1
26273,"Great game concept; delivery is a bit rough, strategy and combat are marginal - battles still can be won, though unrealistic in any way, therefore game is acceptable. But the game is incomplete... 1/2 a game.",1
26274,"I bought the game.
I read along with the story.
Got to the first H scene.
Realized there are no animation. only pictures and text to read.

Refunded.


EDIT:

I was unaware that the  H scenes  further into the story were in fact animated. I had assumed that none of them were. 

Given that I was mistaken I shall re-purchase the game at a later date and try again since I am intrigued with the gaming style and the story concept.",1
26275,"This is NOT and AVN.   I see reviews here saying it's a good AVN, lol.  This is a game.  What does that mean?  There are mechanics to fight scenes, there are quests, there are empire building aspects, and there is as much detail as you would ike.  If you skip the quests that come from infiltrating a foreign land, you will miss many lewd scenes.  I got stuck a few times but, it was my fault.  People playing AVN's blaze through clicking.. here you have to read details to figure out puzzle aspects.   Kudos to the developer for always leaving it obvious if you read.  Good first game",1
26276,"Great writing, dry humor, awesome sex scenes (the early ones are not animated sadly but most are). I was surprised by the world building, the different races and nations are not cookie cutter cliches, each bringing a unique flavor with its own slang, music, clothes etc. I skipped the 1:1 combat at first but when I gave it a try I saw it‚Äôs pretty easy to figure out: your opponent will attack in one of three attacks, each has their own animation. Once you learn which animation means which attack its super easy to counter them, barely an inconvenience. Great game!",1
26277,"Far too many decisions to be made, and some appear to not work correctly at all.  Art is not that good.",0
26278,"Not a bad avn at all. It has a pretty basic story premise with the mc trying to conquer every ""country"" in the realm, but that gives it plenty of options on how you do that. You can decide if you want to be a very dominant ruler that doesnt care about others even having the option to rape a lot of women, or you can play as a more friendly guy that still gets all the women. There is a big focus on impregation of all the women here and definitely a domination focus wiht the sex scenes. There are also a lot of sex scenes in general and the game for sure has set a focus on them. Nevertheless I also quite like the world around it and the story parts which mostly come in quests where you go to the different countries to try to get either some information, or sabotage them or whatever other advantage you can get. There are also a bunch of different races with elves, goblins and centaurs for example.

There is also a lot more gameplay than in your average avn as this has a combat mechanic, that is a more advanced version of ""rock, paper, scissors"" and a combat mechanic for group fighting when invading another country. Then there is also the managment portion to consider and some other smaller mechanics during the quests for example. All in all there is quite a lot and all the things work quite well if you want to do them. However you also have the option to alter how to play which I really like. The game offers you the choice on if you want to skip the group fighting for example, or if you just want to play the entire game without having to manage anything.

Overall a great avn with a ton of sex that also offers enough other content around it to manage to keep you interested and wanting to keep playing to see all the different countries.

26279,"""Vae Victis - Khan"" is an adult game. Fantasy RPG in the form of a vn. It is set in medieval times and you play as a betrayed prince trying to reclaim his rightful place on the throne. Conspiracies and spies are everywhere. Choose to be a brute or try to be the nice guy. You must unite the regions to overthrow your own mother! Unifying them won't be easy! Prepare to.. ""sweat"" for it.. From many different activities! You can be bad, you can be good, but the 1 thing you cannot be is... not being a lustful beast! ^^

Refreshing dialogues that don't try to downplay anything and feel natural. They are more realistic and down to earth which helps with the immersion. The gameplay is mostly in vn format and from the options you can make it only vn (you can auto win every battle). [b]Do the sidequests![/b] While skipping combat won't make you lose anything, if you skip the sidequests you will miss 70%-80% of the game and the adult scenes. 

The game is currently in early access and not 100% finished. This includes and the animated scenes; especially at the start of the game, most of the content is still images. The dev plans to upgrade them to animated, like the majority of the later game is, before the final release.
As far as adult content goes, it has everything. Almost every fetish and position/scenario you can think of! Rule the regions by making one baby at a time! ^^
From the menu, you can opt out of certain content or have it optional.

Choosing content also applies to the actual strategy game. You can turn battles on and off at any given time without repercussions (except locking yourself out of some achievements that look broken regardless for the time being). It has both steam and in-game achievements. Manage your regions and your army! Build, transfer, take care, protect from raids and have romances! Reclaim your birthright to become the King!
Battles are turned-based when it comes to armies and a variation of rock-paper-scissors for simple enemies and bosses. The RPS game isn't based on luck. You can predict your opponent's move and there is a strategy to figure it out. The tutorials are good; including those for managing your army and conquered regions/Kingdom.

It could use some improvements but the content is vast and interesting, same as the combat and the adult scenes!

Are you ready to FIGHT??!!!

26280,Great empire building game with a good story. I would recommend trying it out!,1
26281,Man this game is up there with best. need to work on the breasts on some of these women. Also if this game had better animation it would rival being a DIK. Even though animation is a little shitty it makes up well with the story. my guy could get up there with the top dawgs if he fixes the animation and the saggy tits.,1

[i]‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èKeep in the mind this is my honest review maybe different preference with you , I will share what I feel when I played this game.‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è[/i]

üç≠üçëüç≠

My Score : 8,5/10 
Total Hours : more than 10 Hours (Depend how fast you read and how many playthrough you play it. And your desire to unlock all scenes also all Steam Achievements.)

[b] Positive side : ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è [/b]

1. Game : The game is unique before you start you can select your preferences, such as Sexual Violence, Gay, Bestiality, Bush also can you select trimmed or hairy having this many option is interesting choice.

2. Mechanic : In this game you will find mini games, free roam , and combat mechanic which is turn base. Yup all of this blended with AVN element also choice matter careful for what you choose.  Surprisingly good gameplay, both the combat and the kingdom management. The game is very well-coded too, all works smoothly. Maybe there is no effective army against army mechanics which is a pity I would enjoy to take on a bigger army and out maneuver them to save troops or to be able to conquer a province even if outnumbered

3. Fetish : Many fetish can be found in this game. Incredibly diverse cast with different body types, races and personalities. And To be honest little bit shocked for bestiality can pass strict steam rule, so you can have sex with dog and centaur basically man with large horse penis. Also many creatures such as goblin and orc, even granny.
You can also choose make pregnant with violence become your slave in your prisoner or make them pregnant as your wife.
Freedom to choose either domination or seduction path, This make Replay value pretty high to see another path.

4. Graphic : some of them pretty decent in the early game and some of them pretty good mid late game.

5. Animation : yup there is short animation and little bit clunky not that smooth in every scene but there are many hot lewd scene you can unlock in this game. 

6. Music : Yup there are variety music when playing the game and ambiens sound effects also moaning when in the lewd scene but not all have moaning sound, 

7. Steam Achievements : Steam Achievements available and not too hard to collected. You can collect most of them when you play the game and figure it out your self with try different route or path. And there is also unofficial guide which can help you in the guide section page.

8. Gallery : yup there is gallery scene, to track your progress.

[b]BUT there is point need your attention ‚õî‚õî‚õî‚õî‚õî‚õî[/b]

1. Steam Cloud : Steam cloud support NOT available and sync Correctly  because my recent crash PC, then I realize this feature its must and mandatory also carry all your save and gallery progress which is very important )‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è

26283,"Great graphics although I could use some more animations early on but they are there in the later nations. Loved the fetishes, the dialogs were great, sometimes even hilarious. Good balance of building sexual tension and sex scenes and the world building is not common to the genre, the world of the Twin Sisters continents feels original, not a bunch of fantasy cliches thrown together. Great selection of body types: small girls, big girls, muscle girls, slim girls, big b00bs, flat chests, green girls, dark skinned girls, young and old, the developer is very generous with the selection of girls in the game. While I picked up the Rock Paper Scissors combat early on, later I decide to skip it: just clicked the little ‚Äúchicken‚Äù icon and won. 

Lots of fun, lots of sex, great story, highly recommended!",1
26284,"definitely a great game, with lots of scenes! cant wait to see the completed version of the game, I believe it is going to be great!",1
26285,"Dare I say it...Yes, this is a great game. The story line has far more depth than most of this genre. The typos are few and far apart. The grammar does not reek of a Chinese rip-off. The sex is thoughtful, fulfilling and just raunchy enough to caver all bases. I have been exploring this genre of visual novels and most are just excuses to splash same old sex scenes across the screen. Porn by any other name... But this takes it a step further. It adds to the conversation - which is relevant in any art form and superbly blends a game with an interesting story and sexuality just short of perversity. Well done!  If you ever need a proofreader give me a call.",1
26286,"I enjoyed the game. I thought the story and characters had some depth to them. It was almost like reading/playing  Sci-Fi book only with visuals. I really liked the infiltration missions, they were challenging, funny, and added to the overall story development. Sex scenes visuals are good. I also liked the diversity in characters in the story.",1
26287,"Nice story, but some dialogue could maybe be tightened up a bit, the graphics are ok, and seems to gotten better over time.",1
26288,"I really enjoyed the game, great job with all the different branches that you can spin off into. Story and characters have depth for what this game is, and each individual is unique! Loved the infiltration missions, fun way to get to know the characters more and watch them develop. Sex scene animations are better than most I'd say.  Looking forward to updates!

And not sure what folks are talking about regarding not being able to turn off the combat system.  I played with it on for the first 8 or 9 fights, then turned it off just fine.  Agree that that system could use a bit of tweaking to make it less tedious.",1

26290,"A very enjoyable game in the genre. A very good story; engaging, well written and paced with some decent kingdom building aspects and good mini games. The NSFW scenes are very good and there are a LOT of them. Thoroughly recommended!",1
26291,"What a game.  What does a fantasy game need?  World building.  And this one has it in spades baby.  I'll get to the lewd stuff later, but first I have to give proper credit to how amazing this world is.  Every fiefdom has it's own unique culture you must navigate in order to conquer it.  How do you bring elves, orcs, elfikin, amazons, hobbits, and a diverse cast of humans under your banner?  You better figure it out, because this is not your average conquest.  Brains and brawn are required to reclaim your throne as the rightful Emperor of this troubled land.

It's good to be the King.  Or in this case, the Khan.  As the ruler of an empire, there is no shortage of women.  The only choice is how you will take them.  You can take them all by force.  Or you can take them all by seducing them.  Or maybe you take the wicked by force and the kind softly.  It's totally your choice.  You are the Khan, and your empire is yours to rule as you see fit.

As the Khan, you must maintain your empire.  You have the option of skipping this part, but I would not suggest it.  Keeping your empire happy and obedient is a fun challenge that I personally enjoyed.

In conclusion, this title is one of the most entertaining games I have played in a very long time.  I'm going to have to take a break from AVNs for a while because nothing else is going to compare.",1
26292,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this game.

The developer has put a lot of effort into this title and deserves high praise.

The novel aspect of the game is very well written and had me laughing regularly, especially when choosing the dominant path within conversations.

With regards to renders and animations, there's a really good variety of females to conquer none of which look like characters from other games which makes a nice change. Each area explored looked different with elements of free roam as well. 

As the game goes on, you can tell that animations were also improving and becoming more frequent which gives promise to future work from dev.

The music and sound effects are also pretty good, the latter being damn hilarious in places as they admittedly don't always match the event, but this added to the humour for me.

My only gripe at the start of the game was that the tutorial was a bit bleak and didn't explain very well how you go about managing the world map. 

I soon overcame this hurdle and found myself conquering the world and all the women it had to offer.

Overall this was a very enjoyable game worth paying full price. 

The only downside was that I was left questioning my morals but that's a small price to pay....... right?",1
26293,combat makes the game unplayable. Gotta make it to where it can be skipped. Refunding the game until then.,0
26294,"The game is awesome so far. Part empire building / manage resources, free roam and plenty of side quests to explore the various kingdoms There is surprisingly a lot of content avail considering the game is in early access. Well worth the price  The overall story and renders are great and I like how diverse all of the females are in their appearance. I am looking forward (hopefully) to the continuing adventures of the MC and the various characters that have been introduced, I would give it a ten out of ten.",1
26295,"[h1] (3.2-hours in...) DLW RATED 8 of 10[/h1] (7=passing) [b]Vae Victis - Khan [/b] is an Adult/Choices/Story-Wargame(?) (5.9 Gigs) game where you begin as an heir to the throne but accused of poisoning Dad, thus imprisoned in the dungeon by your (‚Äúyou really wear that thing around the help?‚Äù) sexually overt mother, for 4 years‚Ä¶ but have now managed to escape with plans for your future. 
[h3]UPSIDE:[/h3] 1) After escaping, you no longer have a stink-bucket for a restroom. 2) Graphics are somewhat dated, but sufficiently decent as of 6/17/24. 3) In game Prefs/Options area is very nicely set up. 4) That you and Dad are known as ‚ÄúKhan‚Äù encourages you to have barbarian shit-for-morals, but it‚Äôs your choice‚Ä¶ 5) I like the effort at coming up with an approach apart from 80% of games within this genre; and so will you, see?
[h3]SUBJECTIVE:[/h3] 1) English writing skills are a bit wanting. ‚ÄúBaptize yourself‚Äù? ‚ÄúNone of them is true‚Äù? Perhaps it‚Äôs just the 1000th developer in the world who has never heard of proof reading‚Ä¶ 2) The author has a thing for ‚ÄúBush‚Äù which can be turned off in options (thank you). 3) High heels in ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù times lets you know it‚Äôs a pure fantasy game‚Ä¶ 4) The 1-v-1 Melee system is a more-complicated (believe it or not) version of Rock/Paper/Scissors, and is actually interesting... 5) Barlin is George Lucas, huh?
[h3]DOWNSIDE:[/h3] 1) One hour in, despite animations on the Store Page, I have seen none at all. 2) Multiple consecutive black screens for summing-up sort of end narration are on panic order disconcerting, when you seem them, cuz it's like ""wait... what?"", so naturally lazy by recent standards. 3) ...and so is that same image for 40 straight conversation screens. 4) Manipulating the Big Picture of your world conquest is not as intuitive for us as they have in their minds. They should provide a walk-through of a few turns to get us onboard. I suspect, the Gold needed to get the ball rolling on all resource fronts is connected to Mini-Quests, otherwise (Which can be auto-won). Also, it does give the option to go simple when it comes to the managing the Big Picture stuff, early on. Interesting  but hard to rate the game high 3.2 hours in when it‚Äôs Slow going, and I hope becomes faster.
[h3]SUMMATION:[/h3] 1) Unfortunately, the overall gameplay is difficult to assess one hour in, but the game does have multiple, relatively original aspects‚Ä¶ 2) I have all these dots, see?‚Ä¶ .. . 3) The game seems to head into a Straight-up Wargaming format, but I may be judging it to soon. We know from example screens more sex is on the way, so hopefully, this does not pull to far from that...",1
26296,"Your chances to progress in this game are equal to 0%. 
One time blocked, you are blocked forever. 
No help or mission goal that you can find on the map, nothing. 
The best thing you can do is to give the negative score for this game. 
Like 1/10",0
26297,"It sounded interesting enough to see past it being a VN, but it's slow and boring with rock-paper-scissors as a combat system.

You can skip the combat (missing out on an achievement), but I also didn't really find the story interesting enough to stick around

As you can see it almost took 30 minutes to get to the conquering part of the game, and it was not interesting enough to keep me here.",0
26298,"Although the game is at an ""Early Access"" state, it feels like a below average visual novel from the early 2010 (ish)!!!
[list]
[*] In 2024, the game's graphics are simply unacceptable!
[*] The game's combat is clunky and boring to say the least. The developer has made it difficult (even though you have an in-game option to make your life a little easier) in order to make you burn through your two-hour refund period, I'm guessing... ;)
[*] The game's user interface is totally outdated!

I could go on and on about other things I didn't like about a game released in 2024, but I hope you get the gist!

26299,"The game is extremely well written, and it is the best quality of the game. The scenes are hot and heavy, mc's interactions with the other characters are delightful in any path or option, and generally speaking the characters are not clueless idiots. The renders are good, and there are plenty of wenches for all kinds of tastes. The game also features a wide selection of fetishes. Lastly, the minigames are fun and if you don't like them, they can be bypassed.

26309,"Great idea, badly executed. The game is basically unplayable given there isn't a UI in-game, not even an audio tutorial. Manual is too simple, enough to use the game but not enough for playing it. If the game is at a point even blind people can play this could be a great game, but surely not for now.",0
26310,"So the challenge, can a blind person play this? If I know what this is I may be able to tell you better.
Here is a description of a playthrough:
Press S then 1 to start a single player game.
From the achievements available I guess there are 3 levels.
Controls
WASD do the moving.
Left click for the shooting.
Drop some sort of beacon with G, it is the only thing thus far that I can suss directional sound that gets louder the closer you are to it. For what purpose? Your guess is as good as mine.
Press 1 for a beepy noise that will stop sometimes ond become a high pitch screech at others. For what purpose? No idea.
Press 2 for a sonar noise that does seemingly nothing. the noise has not changed in any way whilst in use.
Press 3 to make a random scratchy noise, again serving no apparent use that I have found as yet.
Okay so wander around until I happen into a whiney noise. If I stand still the whiney noise gets louder until eventually a cockerel crows and I am dumped back to the menu.
Guess you need to avoid the whiney noise.
Try again, see if beepy/screechy noise is helping you pinpoint the hen firer. Maybe but no matter how much I shoot when it becomes screechy I cannot dehen the thing. Get cockerelled again.
back to menu.
Try sonar thing, still does nothing get cockerelled.
Try scratchy thing.... Cockerelled.
So can a blind person play this game? Yes about as well as everyone else at a guess. in other words not very.
Will I play again? Yes.
I will decockerel the whiney noise some how.
Please leave a comment if you get any further. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious to the Dev, just not the rest of the planet.....

26311,"The art is gorgeous, the mystery is intriguing, and the music is peak!! I might've spent too much time listening to the title screen music as you can see from my hours.

Story:

The story starts off light, focusing on the slice of life and idol routine, but quickly takes a dark turn as a crime is committed, building into an intense climax. 

After finishing the demo, I was hooked in the mystery. The writers did a great job of making you want to know what happens next. 

Gameplay: 

The gameplay is like Ace Attorney/Danganronpa where you have to select evidence to support/contradict a statement. The difficulty wasn't easy, but wasn't frustratingly hard either. I felt it was a good balance that made you think.

The game also has 'free time events' and a character relationship meter which reminded me of Persona or Kara no Shoujo.

This is great for those who want to spend time with the characters and learn more about them, but for me, I chose to spend time in the detective's office to dig for more clues (I'm glad the devs allow us to do that for those who prefer the mystery).

If you're a fan of mystery VNs, this is by far one of the most interesting ones I've played and worth checking out!",1
26312,Whispers of the Luminaries is one of the best graphic novels you can play. It has a really well thought out storyline which is full of mystery and has you on the edge. The artwork is reallllllly good as well as the OST's. Also seeing the progress that the developers had so far was really charming. So if you're looking for a VN to play I commend you this brilliant game.,1
26313,"Murder mystery? Check
Somber atmosphere? Check
GORGEOUS artwork? CHECK CHECK CHECK
Protagonist with a face? Check (not a given, so +)
GORGEOUS characters?  CHECK CHECK CHECK (have you seen that hot bespectacled man? oh boy)

There was another demo prior to this and one can really notice the difference in quality between them. The UI is more refined and responsive in this one (even if a little awkward still). Writing has also seen an up in quality. Some artwork (such as scenes or character sprites) have been added. Also an actual banger song at the end of the demo. All of this to say the devs are actively addressing issues, and building upon their existing work.

I don't doubt that given further time and experience they will make a great game.",1
26314,Why it say crime scene on it tho,1
26315,won't use this but will support.,1
26316,"""Alibi: The Dinner Party"" is surprisingly good, considering it is Monabi Games' first effort.

The soundtrack's jazzy mix complemented the unfolding plot; started laid-back and became increasingly more frantic as the progression reached a crescendo. Speaking of, the story's pacing was impeccable, holding my attention throughout the game. The suspense and intrigue, passed the opening, was so compelling that I completed it in one sitting, as I had to know the conclusion.

The game's true strength lay in its logical design. It refrained from convoluted puzzles or game mechanics (looking at you, Danganronpa), allowing the focus to remain on solving the mystery at hand. This approach made me feel engaged, accomplished and smart as I was able to deduce the correct answer without resorting to absurd reasoning.

In essence, ""Alibi: The Dinner Party"" is a refined visual novel that skillfully combines music, narrative, and logical plotlines. If you're in search of a captivating experience, this game comes highly recommended.",1
26317,"A detective visual novel in which there are no bad choices.

There has been a murder, and you have been assigned to conduct the investigation. It happened at one of your friends' house during a party, thus you must keep your personal feelings apart from your professional life. 

The gameplay is comparable to that of any other visual novel. There is a lot of reading and clicking the mouse button to proceed to the next text. Because you're in the role of a detective, you have a few more options to help you feel like you're actually doing some work. However, the game is still linear and does not allow you any freedom.

There is no looking for clues or solving logic puzzles on your own. All you have to do is move around the house and click on potential evidence that the game presents you. You will not miss anything because all important information is immediately recorded in your casefile. 

Once you‚Äôre done with the house, you move to interrogation. It's simple; you listen to the suspect, occasionally put pressure on them by clicking on highlighted words, provide evidence to make them crack, and point to important rooms in the house. And once again, you can't make a mistake. Even if you choose the incorrect option, the characters will just remark that it is wrong and you will be able to choose again until you click on the one that is right.",1
26318,A short little detective game in a similar style to Phoenix Wright. A nice attempt for a first time game developer,1
26319,"tl;dr it's okay, worth spending an evening on

gah writing reviews without spoiling story games is a pain
i almost want to write a review as a message to the developer rather than for those who're looking to suss out whether they should buy and play this
it's not glaringly bad at anything, and there's noticeable awkwardness here and there, but the game and the story is not in any way ruined by that, so there
it's a competent detective story, it's interesting enough, it's a pretty good purchase

p.s.
regards to the developer, i do hope to see more if that's on the cards",1
26320,"It was fun. I really enjoyed the part with the soir√©e and the other part with the prom. My first 24 minutes in this game were full of joy and wonder, but when it was revealed a body had been discovered at the party, I was filled with such despair!

Would recommend.",1
26321,"It was fun. The characters generally had strong identities, though that strength did seem a little wasted as the game focuses entirely on the A plot with not much else going on. It might have been nice to see more interactions with Jasmine as well, perhaps with certain revelations being ordained through past experiences involving her and told in retrospect. Additionally, while the investigation steps are generally varied in how they feel, the game has runs of the same kind of stuff in a row, which may have been benefited by better interspersing evidence gathering and suspect interviews sections. Overall good mystery and worth playing.",1
26322,Another amazing puzzle game from Desert Fox. Keeping the history of Point and Click alive with a spooky twist. Got to love it.,1
26323,"I recommend ALL of the Bad Dream/Faded stories games to any puzzle lover. I love them all, and I love the replayability of them to find different solutions. I'm having a time with this one, but i'm getting there! The Dev of these games is also so sweet and tries to fix any problems you might run into. All of these games are 10/10 for me and are my comfort games when my anxiety is high and I just need to relax and jump into a different world. Thank you Dev for all your hard work and dedication to bring us more games! <3",1
26324,"Honestly, seeing how these series expands with lore and from simple point and click adventures to full 3D exploration with same formula is a great play. This one goes with a collection of chapters all reminiscent to previous days as a follow up. Let it be eerie or let it be confusing but the story is engaging and fun to explore alongside with the achievements to collect meaning it also has secrets to unfold with fun twists and ends.
Lovely game! Can't wait to see more of these.",1
26325,"Amazing game. 
I really love this game and how it expands on the lore of the other games. I also love how many new character interactions you have. 
The puzzles in this game are very entertaining I love point & click games from this dev all of the other games are amazing too.  I liked how different each ""level"" was but that some were still connected.  Seeing scenes from previous games awakened my nostalgia from playing them. It's a very fun experience.",1
26326,Very fun point and click puzzle story. I've always liked this developer's games.,1
26327,Love these games from Desert Fox.  A real puzzler to follow the different paths to various achievements.,1
26328,"I have enjoyed most of this developers point and click titles, so I do not think I am being too harsh here: 

The total content is around 2-3 hrs.. absolute tops, probably far less if you aren't high/wasted. There are some interesting point and click segments that involve strange interactions with the environment, but there is maybe a grand total of one-two hours of these segments and at least what feels like 30+ minutes of holding down a key and waiting for something to happen. 

I honestly feel like not much effort was put into this game, since compared to previous titles, or even other point and click titles the interactions seem sparse and there isn't an iota of the detail that you will find in the previous gems from this developer. Not to mention that there are no real puzzles and the game is much more of a walking simulator than a point and click. 

All in a all a pretty big disappointment.

@Desert Fox: I just give honest opinions. You have to understand that I just bought a game, played it and gave it a review. I did not do so with malicious intent. If I had found the game good and worth the price I would have given a great review. As the person buying it is only my obligation to pay the money and be completely honest if I write a review. Take my review with a grain of salt given my expectations and preferences and use it as information to improve future developments if you care about players with similar preferences.",0
26329,"My favorite type of point & click. Tricky enough that I have to use my brain but not so difficult that I pull all the hair out of my head in frustration. Deceptively simple art that is fun to look at but also just the right amount of creepy. A cool story line and world. Minimal dialogue (except the creepy guy who wants a date - hahahaha!). Nothing on here is overkill, and it's as fun to play as the other Desert Fox titles I've played so far (I'm burning through all of them). I clocked a little over 3 hours on this, but I took my time looking around and had a couple times I had to walk away from the computer for ""responsibilities."" There would still be plenty for me to go back and do now that I've gone through all the chapters. Worth the full price. I'll keep buying these as long as he keeps creating them.",1

Welcome to Turtle Bay, a beautiful tropical Oasy where the rarest turtles live happily in their natural and protected environment.
But our help is needed because an earthquake has caused damage to houses and shops, endangering turtles, many nests have been devastated and the eggs dispersed.
Our task is to help Kanoa and Malia restore the island, its community of inhabitants and search for the lost eggs of our turtle friends.

It's very relaxing, there's nothing difficult, it's about finding objects to match, alternating with sections of ""Bingo"" where we have to find numbers that parade before us in a snake of balls.
When we complete these sections we will receive a part of the island map, coins, pearls or rare eggs; they are all objects that are needed to restore the island and make it a paradise again.
If we want to collect more coins there is ""Gameroom"" with many beautiful games that will make us win easily.
Collect as many coins as you will need to unlock ""Collectibles"" which are aids for the island.
When we have saved all the turtles and collected the pearls, ""Bonus Contents"" will be unlocked where you will find:
Bingo blitz
Infinite matching fun
Solitaire collections
Pachinko blitz
Show intro
Gallery
Collectibles
Music

It is an excellent game suitable for those who want moments of relaxation, with engaging music, the graphics are very beautiful and you can admire many landscapes full of flowers, animals, plants and the blue of the sea.
It's a virtual holiday to get away from the daily routine!!!!!!!

26342,"[h1]I SAVED THE SEA TURTLES![/h1]

I fell in love with Mixo Games after playing a really unique game called Lost Amulets
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184970/Lost_Amulets_Four_Guardians/¬†
They have found a unique way to incorporate Bingo and Marble Popping to create a challenging and addictive hybrid in a game called Twistingo!

In this third installment of Twistingo, we travel to Turtle Bay Island to help the locals restore their shops and locate missing sea turtle eggs. Hold on tight; you're in for a wild ride!¬†

You can choose to play in a Casual Mode (slow animations, more hints, easier gameplay), a Normal Mode (faster bingo balls, fewer hints, more challenge), or an Expert Mode (quick bingo balls, no hints, harder levels) so everyone can enjoy playing at their own pace.
¬†
You begin by playing a Hidden Object Scene, but these aren't your average, typical HO scenes. The camera angle is probably the first thing you'll notice because it's as if you are standing and looking down at the objects. The second thing that catches your eye is the uniqueness of the objects themselves. These aren't junk items thrown into a pile on a table in the corner of a room or random household items scattered around the scene. At first glance, it seems as though there are only a handful of objects; some of the items even appear to be quite large.¬†

There are two variations of HO Scenes. The first type requires you to find a specified number of items that are listed on a strip of paper, such as 5 Keys. As you remove the listed items, you'll uncover more strips of paper with different items to search for. Incredibly, the scene that appeared to have a scant amount of objects, turns out to be a multi-layered, multi-faceted, complex hidden object scavenger hunt!
¬†
The second Hidden Object type is a Matching variation where you remove pairs of identical objects. Again, at first glance, the scene appears to have only a few objects, but as you remove pairs, they uncover a whole slew of objects below them! Somehow, this developer has mastered the art of deception and is able to hide objects in plain sight!

The goal of each Hidden Object Scene is to find Bingo Balls to play a game of Twintingo, or recover the missing Turtle Bay Map pieces, which allows you to progress through the island. As you progress, you will also be tasked with finding amulet fragments to restore Seven Sacred Amulets or sets of Pearls to restore the Island Artifact.¬†¬†

Twistingo has two variations. The first variation requires removing Bingo Balls as they travel in a single-file line (some levels have two lines & two openings). The Bingo Balls also rotate slightly, but this feature can be disabled. You can remove a ball by either clicking on the actual ball or by clicking on the number from the Bingo Card itself. The Bingo Balls must match the number and the color shown on the card(s). If you select incorrectly in this variation, the line will advance closer to the opening. If the bingo Ball line reaches the opening, you will lose and will have to replay that level. As you progress, Bonus Balls will appear in the line, such as Wild Joker Balls or bonuses that freeze time or push the line backward a bit. In this variation, you can earn extra coins when you finish bingo cards, but you must click on them before they disappear.
¬†
The second Twistingo variation is a lot less challenging, but I actually like this version better. Instead of bingo numbers, each ball has a picture or symbol. As the balls roll out of the opening, you simply click its matching onyx stone from the pile. Although you don't have to worry about the balls reaching the end of the line in this version, you do have to refrain from random clicking because additional stones are added to the pile if you make a wrong selection. In this version, you will uncover Turtle Eggs to save the sea turtles that can only be found on Turtle Bay Island!

The Coins you earn are used to purchase Island restorations or feed turtles, etc. This is also an unusual feature because it's in the form of a movie clip with incredibly beautiful scenery. The coins can also be used to purchase Casino tickets to play various mini-games, such as Solitaire, Pachinko, or a game where you must guess if the next card will be lower or higher. If you win the game, you will earn up to four times the amount of coins spent; if you lose, you only lose the small amount you paid to play the mini-game. The Pachinko game is really fun; it's similar to pinball; I just wish¬†it had flippers you could click to try to flip the balls back up as you would in pinball!

You will be playing through a mix of marble popper variant and HOS, with side quests in the ""game room"" where there are one-up one-down solitaire, a guess the higher or lower card game, and Pachinko machine ball-breaking layouts to help you build up funds to buy assorted extra goodies for the benefit of the locals.  As in the previous game, you must construct your pathway through the island by finding the jigsaw puzzle pieces of the map as you're going along and assembling the puzzle until the entire map is built.

This CE has an extra chapter of content tacked onto the end of the SE content, but it's not obvious as the game just keeps going along the pathway with a few extra jigsaw pieces until you rescue a seventh turtle nest (the SE has just 6 turtle nests/chapters total).  I would not have realized this myself except for noting some very specific numerical typos in the storyline texts (now fixed) while beta testing!  The storyline this time is much improved and while it's not great literature, a lot less contrived than in earlier games, and all the scenes are voiced-over.  Other CE extras unlock after you've finished the main quest on the map and include: 6 bonus marble popper levels (3 regular, 3 no-lose), 6 ""clutter"" style HOS, 18 solitaire games, 9 Pachinko games, a music player, and a relaxing slideshow of pretty tropical images with an ambient soundtrack in the background.

If you like the spin on the Zuma-type marble popper play where you must click on numbers in bingo cards as the same numbers appear on marbles in the chain, yes, those levels are back.  Turn off the rotating numbers in MP levels unless maybe you're super good at this sort of game.  The ""click on rocks matching the marble symbol"" to rescue a turtle nest MP levels appear at the end of every chapter.  But the vast majority of this game is HOG: either traditional find stuff in a scene with the ""list"" gradually revealing on cards as you find things, or ""clutter"" type where you pick 2 of the same.  While in the HOG scenes you must also locate fragments of artifacts, bingo balls (numbered marbles) to unlock the next MP level, or lost pearls.  Every chapter is somewhere between 7-10 levels long and there's never more than 2-3 MP levels plus the one super easy turtle nest MP level per chapter, so I was getting a little HOG-ged out going through one HOS after another and would have preferred a few more of the marble popping levels.  The level of challenge in the MP levels isn't all that intimidating...I'm not an extreme expert at the genre, but didn't struggle all that much even on the hardest difficulty and the game is pretty forgiving of letting a couple of marbles go into the drains before you lose.

For some reason, the 3 ""regular"" MP levels in the CE extras are serious marble rage games which I wouldn't recommend playing except maybe on the easiest difficulty; I don't think they are winnable on the hardest difficulty (I tried and tried and finally swallowed my pride and switched to normal for those levels, and barely scratched my way through).  The rest of the CE bonus levels are quite enjoyable, as are the side games in the ""game room"".  I don't know exactly how many solitaire and Pachinko layouts there are in the game room, but I played the game room for at least an hour before I saw any repeats.  If you enjoy HOGs and don't mind something a little different here and there, much recommended.  But three games in this series is enough for me if they're going to keep in the mostly HOG vein, as it was the MP aspect that originally drew me to this series.",1
26344,"This game is very much like the others in the series.  It is a good game that is a HOG plus marble popping game.   The other reviews did a great job at describing this game.  I like the game and think it is a unique game that I don't think you will find anywhere else.  I purchased the other two in the series on another site and  let me just say I don't regret buying them.

 If you have a problem or a question the developer will address your concerns.  I had a problem with Norton going off and was told there something in the game that causes that and it will be taken out in a few days.  I selected always allow because I trust the developer and Steam. I have no problems with my computer and it runs like it should with the game on.  I played for over 4 hours and I am only half way through the game (not including the bonus content).  It is a very good game and well worth the money.",1
26345,"First, I can't say enough about the art work.  Its beautiful.  But, more important, its clear and vibrant.  So the HOG parts of this game are fun and interesting instead of frustrating and muddy.

I like the HOG (Hidden Object Game) type of games.  But I rarely play them because they usually rely on trying to pick objects out of barely recognizable, muddy, layouts.  Not fun, or interesting, for me.

Turtle Bay is completely different.  The artwork is beautiful, like I said above.  But the hidden object layouts are so much better than I have seen anywhere else.  The first thing I noticed is that some objects are large.  Unusual but welcome.  Next, they are laid out in a jumble or pile.  Noting like the Clutter games which are way more than I like.  At Turtle Bay, its just right.  Sometimes your task is to match pairs of the same item.  Other times you look for a certain number of items printed on slips of paper in scene.  I really enjoy them.

There are also Jewel Match levels, to earn extra gold to ""buy"" in game extras, as well as Pachinko style levels.   I have only played either of those a little.  But they are great too and just as beautiful as the rest of the game.

Finally, there are Luxor style bingo levels.  I don't much care for them.  BUT, that is only because I don't much like that style of puzzle.  It seems like I am always hunting for  a certain piece and then spending the entirety of the session in the last few inches of the track, trying to avoid the end.  Not fun for me.  You might love them though.  Technically, they work and look great.

tl:dr If you love HOGs, Jewel Match, or Luxor style matching, you will love this game.",1
26346,The puzzles are fun and the art is amazing! There's large subtitles and good voice acting too. Thanks very much for making this game!,1
26347,"It works but there is no care put into the game. The only innovation I see here is the checkpoints. At best, it is a worse minecraft parkour map. At worst, it is a bad asset flip with little to no care put in.
I do like the doggos at the end though.

The experience is great and I like how large the map is there so many things to explore like the waterfall and the different inhabitant on it. I like the Howling mechanic since you can.. you know.  The map design is great and the atmosphere is pretty chill and cool. What I wish to be fix before full release is the terrain collision, sometimes you just pass through them or stuck on them while climbing. But overall excellent game with great appeal and story.

you don't manually sell things or even get to polish the gems... you just shave them, that's it

26365,There's zero tutorial or explanation for the ratings your finished results get.  You can buy upgrades and tools but there's no title or explanation for what they are.  Just a vague picture and you can guess what you're getting.  Some sort of help along the way would make this game a lot more enjoyable.,0
26366,"A simple jewel crafting simulator. The final product, no matter how horribly you screw up and get lowly graded, looks shiny, unique and appealing. However, if you are a perfectionist or have OCD, you might be slightly disappointed.

There is only 2 main tasks that you repeat over and over: 
Directing the gemstone's face to grind & grinding the gemstone to the directed line.

The $300,000 upgrade tool automatically takes away the former task. By the time you save up that much, you probably deserve that luxury.

As other reviews had mentioned, there is no tool tips nor any form of tutorial. Hopefully the devs will do something about it. For now, „Åø„Åø„Åø„Åø„Åö provided a very informative guide in Japanese language so do check it out.

In my opinion, the most useful tools to start out with are the $5000 ones: 
The 'Circular 3 Arrows' icon tool which lets you slow down your gem rotation significantly. 
The 'Down arrow' icon tool lets you slow down the speed your gem lowers down onto the grindstone.
The 'Gem' icon tool lets you slow down the speed of grinding your gem on the grindstone.

There's also a $5000 upgrade (Wrench > Crosshair icon) which lets you reset the gemstone to default position with the 'H' key, but you can actually 'Settings > Return to Title' then go back to the gemstone for that function. This might be patched eventually.

I got my first SSS on the black D20 crystal (6th cut). There's this sense of satisfaction looking at the shiny gems I crafted. The only downside of this game is I cannot yeet them gemstones. I'll get some help.",1
26367,"It's good I guess? 

But can you at least add THE NAME of features in game? I don't know what is this feature for unless I unlocked it. It's annoyed me.

Oh, about supported language table in store page, I think you should remove it ALL because this game don't have any single word. -_- It's kind of deceive you know?",1
26368,"the controls are janky and awkward, the background is unusually low detail despite everything else, the UI iconography is impossibly vague despite the devs wishing for it to be a ""language free game anyone can understand"", a huge amount of the tools are locked out and have to be paid for with ingame money earned from making the gems and theres not much else to be doing other than making the gems and naming them once youre done

...yet, despite all of those complaints, i can't deny it's not a very pleasant and compelling game. it's very satisfying to finally figure out the right way to do certain cuts and see your rank and skill in making the gems rise over time. getting my first SS rank was extremely gratifying, and its nothing more than a vague statistic attached to your finished piece. definitely not going to be for everyone with how samey it is and both literally and metaphorically grindy it is, but hey, that's how it goes some times. the devs are also clearly taking on feedback and putting out patches to make it even better, so its all smiles over here from me!",1

26370,A relaxing game with good visuals. The only major problem is no sort of introduction or explanation of the upgrades. Right now the game is pretty bare in terms of game play but if you like repetitive games you'll like this. Even though this game is so new I thoroughly enjoy it and I can't wait to see what the developers do next.,1
26371,"As a person who loves jewelry design, this game is accurate in most ways for lapidary arts but also it is relaxing and hypnotizing. This truly is a great game for jewelrysmith geeks out there.",1
26372,"Refunded: Unplayable due to inexcusably poor UI. 

You cannot rotate the gemstones using the mouse: keyboard inputs only. And yet no other keyboard input is properly recognized for navigating the UI - you can't even use ESC to exit a window. (ESC inexplicably opens the graphics settings menu.)

Instead, you have to use the mouse cursor to push buttons displayed on the screen for just about everything. Furthermore, the most commonly used buttons (ACCEPT, EXIT, etc) are deliberately programmed as ""Hold to Accept"", meaning that you need to click on them for a long time before the input is recognized.
 
At first glance, it would appear that a team of specialists in programming and psychological torture had put their heads together with the single purpose of creating the worst, most frustrating UI in the history of gaming. More likely, however, is that this game was originally designed for touchscreen smartphones and absolutely no effort whatsoever was made to convert it to PC. Note also that there's no controller support. Why? Because, again, it's a smartphone game that assumes you have a touchscreen. 

Also, this game does not support multiple aspect ratios. 16:9 is the only one available, meaning black bars on the sides for anyone using any other aspect ratio monitor - yet another testament to how utterly lazy and unskilled the devs truly are.

I honestly cannot comment on whether or not the gameplay itself is enjoyable or rewarding. I requested my refund after suffering through 8 minutes of painfully frustrating, absolutely jaw-dropping developmental incompetence. It's truly unfortunate, because with just the tiniest effort, this could have been a wonderfully nice, cozy, relaxing game. Alas, in it's current state, it is all but unplayable.",0

26378,"Move aside Mario! Move aside Lisa from 'Imagine: Master Chef' for the Nintendo DS! Move aside Sonic!
Orbo has secured his spot on the throne of gaming greats, and don't expect to see him ousted anytime soon.
The gaming mascots of old have dissolved from the modern zeitgeist, and Orbo alone remains.
Why you ask? It's simply a matter of marketability and relatability.

It's a well known fact that children with underdeveloped minds used to be the primary consumer of video games. This led to the popularization of video game mascots characterized by nauseating neon colors and cocky irreverent attitudes. 

Whether it is due to efforts to protect children from LGBT propaganda, new opportunities for children to work in mines/quarries, or the devastating consequences of sending minors to the metaverse; the political happenings of the last decade have essentially taken children out of the picture today. 

Only one class of people remain to decide if games are good or bad, 30-65 year old white-collar desk workers. Behavioral studies have proven time and time again that these salary men spend (at a minimum) 55% of their day playing games on their Lenovo ThinkPad while their boss isn't looking. And as of 2023, their game of choice is Orbo! Staring an icon who accurately depicts the trials and tribulations of modern office life like none before. The AAA gaming industry has finally woken to the stark lack of representation of the white armless man, and they're receiving dividends in return.

We invite you (given that you fit into the correct demographic) to engulf yourself in the lisztomania of Orbo, a movement that's on course to rank between Protestantism and Catholicism in the census of 2030.",1
26379,"This game's pretty short, but its really fun. There is a bit of a learning curve when starting off, but its pretty easy to get the controls down once you play around with them for a bit.",1
26380,"Humor in games generally struggles to land for me, I'm not fond of comedy games with silly premises which come off as a desperate comedian's attempt at winning over a laugh: ""Look, this Goat is flying! Goats don't do that, LOL!""

Orbo's Odyssey is genuinely funny. It employs violent madcap humor, as if the absurd is its sword and bafflement its shield. Most of this game's humor feels as if it comes from a pure source, what I mean by that is there's a clear lack of comedic structure. Why are there cardboard cutouts of what I'm pretty sure are stock images of rats scattered across one area of the game? I don't know, but it's hilarious.

Don't let the comedy overshadow what really makes this game good: the gameplay. As far as protagonists of platformers go, Orbo's a charmingly unique character who's blisteringly fast and able to fly across large areas of the map with ease. His quick hops and fast flying actually handles really well, impressively so when you realize you're guiding around what's basically just a person-shaped missile. The music is great, too, and I would love to buy the soundtrack down the line.

Safe to say the only con this game has is that it's pretty short, I beat the main story in an hour. There's secrets to find, sure, but that short length may be off-putting to some players. To those players I say this: Orbo's Odyssey is what happens when someone passionate sits down and creates something for you. 

Orbo's Odyssey is a sandwich, lovingly made with store bought ingredients, which gives you the impression that you could have made that sandwich on your own. After all, it's just a sandwich. Hell, you could've went to a deli and got a sandwich with imported ingredients, crafted by a sandwich artist who you know takes their job seriously because their sandwiches come with a wood skewer. But that sandwich you're looking at, made with store bought ingredients, was handed to you by a person who didn't ask for anything major in return. In fact, you were craving a sandwich, and someone put their heart into putting one together. And before you know it, you've devoured said sandwich, and while its taste is washed away with a quick swig of water, the memory remains.

So yeah, buy this game.",1

26387,"A fun little platformer that has some flaws. I felt a lot of the level design didn't really accommodate the movement system, especially with how tight some of the turns the game expects you to make. The collectibles are really small and super easy to blast past, forcing you to either do multiple runs of the same cluster or slow down and slowly walk across to get everything. I greatly felt the absence of a roll, which I think would have been a great asset for a game like this especially since the character already spins in one of their moves.

This is a smaller side note but I was also a little underwhelmed on how much weird stuff was in the game. Most of the really weird stuff I found was the stuff I already saw in the trailer, although admittedly I pretty much blitzed through this game and didn't really stop to explore much.

With 4 levels, 1 boss and 1 secret ending, I hope the level mods address the lack of content or time trials to elevate its value and provide an avenue of challenge aside from speed running the base game. Beyond the mechanics, the vibes and quirky setting does add to its charm such as the vampires and anomalies and not to forget the music.

26405,"Orbo's Odyssey is a simple and sweet speedy platformer with simple movement, high ceiling use and neat exploration. You only have around three moves, Jump, dive, and stomp, with some variations in between those moves.

Orbo's adventure is a pretty unique one at that with interesting art style that is uncanny in the best way possible, both in world design and characters. The comedy is also pretty funny as well to me. I just wish there was more of it.

My only problem with with this game is that I wish there was more of it. Witch is a good problem to have tbh. Would defiantly love to see more of this style and humour combine with the unique free movement it offers.  If you have a few dollars in you're account with 1 to 2 hours to kill, this is definitely it. 

I wish the developer great luck with there next project, because if it's anything like this, it's a instant banger.

26408,"Orbo is a fast-paced 3D platformer that is similar in structure to Mario Odyssey (each level features multiple gears to collect, which are strewn about the level or hidden behind small challenges). The main star of the show is the movement, which feels excellent to control; it's simple to get around with, but the skill ceiling is so high that you can always go faster. This speedrunning mentality is most present in the time trials (one of which is available on every level), which also feature dev times to beat for an achievement.
The ""narrative"" does take a backseat, but a game like this really doesn't need it to be front-and-center. There is a few characters to talk to, and their dialogue is consistently goofy and funny.
Despite being all royalty free music as far as I can tell, the soundtrack is a banger and fits the vibe of each level perfectly.

The game is short (although the dev did say they are planning to address this in some way), currently featuring 4 main levels and taking about an hour to beat. Although with how fun the movement is there is a lot of replayability in attempting speedruns, whether it's just a timetrial, a whole level or the full game.
Despite the game's length there is plenty of secrets hidden around, and all the levels look & feel super unique.

They rarely make 'em like they used to, but this game is just a pure joy to play, simple as. GO ORBO!!!.",1
26409,"Fun little game, enjoyed it very much :3
Silly lil platformer with concerning lil secrets if you want them lol",1
26410,"This game is way too fun. I played Peeb's Adventure a while back, and so when I saw there was another game by the same developer, I had to get it! These guys have a real knack for making enjoyable games, and I hope to see much more of Orbo and Peeb in the future! I heavily recommend this game for players who like short, fun experiences.",1
26411,"EASILY one of the best games I've ever played. Movement is on point, music is just plain-out perfect, NPCs are really funny and the hidden secrets are REALLY worth finding.

My only complaint is that the game was really short, I managed to pretty much 100% it in an hour and a half or so. The devs did an amazing work on this game, and I get it's short since it's meant to be a way to raise funds on their larger projects.

Definitely worth getting, and please make sure to check out their other work. These guys are really damn talented.",1
26412,"Was truly blown away by this game. Incredibly fun gameplay and movement, great humor and style, and an awesome soundtrack. Only negative is the length, I would happily throw any amount of money at these guys for a full length game. 10/10, play it right now.",1
26413,"great, short adventure with some amazing movement. The dash tire-roll combo is so much fun to use and fly around the map at high speeds. There seems to be a way to dash and tire-roll at the same time for a quick take off but I couldn't quite do it consistently. After beating the game I'm left wanting more and cant wait to check out what the community has made in the workshop",1
26414,"Great little charming game! Really hope the devs get the opportunity to make more, bigger games. Since these feel like a great foundation to be expanded upon. Orbo deserves lots of kisses <3",1
26415,"This game is really fun! I played through the whole thing, and while it's not the longest game ever, it certainly makes up for it in pure quality and humor! Very satisfying to play!
I'd also recommend Nowhere Michigan on Itch.io, which is made by this developer! And Peebs Adventure too. They're also quite short, but they're also quite good!

I can't wait to see where this developer goes in the future! Quite the talented person/people. 10/10, worth every penny I spent.",1
26416,"The best fundamental platformer the world has ever seen, the level of control makes this an auto-buy.
On top of that, comes an delightful fun world created and everything dripping with details and fun!",1
26417,"Orbo's Odyssey is a bite sized 3d platformer with focus on a trippy visual style, fast paced momentum gameplay, and exploration. Its certainly a short game, but the experience is quite tight, and there's never a dull moment. You can easily finish the campaign within an hour if you so please, but if you're going for completion, your time with this little game will be a fair bit longer.

There is also a fair slew of secrets to uncover with this little game, but I'll leave all those for you to find on your own.

Overall, I'd highly recommend checking this game out, as it has already cemented itself as a recent favorite of mine.",1
26418,"Enjoyed every second I had with Orbo's Odyssey. The game itself isn't super long, but for the price the humor and gameplay (and if you're into achievement/secret hunting, good luck!!!) make it one I have no hesitation recommending. Some of the secrets here also refer back to past or future Feverdream Studios games. If you want the secret lore, you're gonna have to look into Lets Go Baby, Peeb's Adventure, and the upcoming Nowhere, MI. Have fun!",1
26419,"A short and sweet 3d platformer adventure with satisfying movement and silly sight gags.
Very fun very schmovement dosent overstay its welcome. fun",1
26420,"i loved the part in orbos oddysey where borbo said its odeseeying time and he orboeedetagdsb



.",1
26421,"Cute unique game. I only wish it had more levels/collectables, something like a gumball machine of skins or customizable character, finding currency or costume pieces around levels would be awesome. I beat the whole main game in 60 minutes, this reminded me a lot of Toy Story 3 for Xbox 360 for some reason, along with Psychonauts and Banjo Kazooie, it has amazing controls and feel, I also recognize the dev team is pretty small. Maybe a community map contest with some kind of incentive for the winner? That plus costume pieces I swear would make this a really next level awesome experience (for me). I would also love some more thematic music: spooky music, industrial music, etc. for levels over and above the chillwave trance dance music. 

Maybe that's a lot to ask for a game with this pricetag, maybe it has plans for future idk, it would be a justified price increase to even double of current price",1
26422,"A great game to appreciate from the confirmed perspective of a small dev trying to get his creative nut off. Mouse and keyboard focused platforming is executed really well and the time trial challenges really gave me an appreciation for the tight but reliable movement mechanics. The biggest problem this game has is simply being too short, and the overall level design not compensating for the lack of limits the gameplay incorporates for your character. But it's cheap too, easily within it's punching weight for the asking price. Pick it up, support the dev, and pray that you seem him working on even more great stuff in the future",1
26423,"goes faaaaaast I like that. Movement is smooth and pleasing. It feels nice just moving around the weird and interesting worlds.
From what I can see, there's not a lot of content, but the price is super low so its totally fine. Also you have secrets to find and you can always improve your timed runs.",1
26424,Absolutely phenomenal from start to finish. A completely otherworldly atmosphere combined with extremely fluid movement which allows for a shocking degree of control with relatively few buttons.,1
26425,"The only problem with this game is that it's detrimentally short. The layman could easily beat it in under two hours and get a refund. However, I think the dev deserves my cash so I can one day play Nowhere, Michigan. I'm even more excited for it than I was before.",1
26426,"Very nice game! God bless the developers, especially the fat one",1
26427,THIS GAME ABSOLUTELY FUCKING SUCKS I DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO YOU GUYS OR ANYONE ELSE AT ALL THERES LITERALLY BETTER GAMES OUT THERE THAN THIS ONE AUBIDAUDIBUADBIUAWIDUBAWDUIAWDBIUAWDBUIRBAVFAVFUAGWFA,0

My mom said that if I get 20 awards, she‚Äôll buy me Resident Evil 2.",1
26429,haha 10 / 10 jokes evrywere its a feverdreem like no other,1
26430,"Pretty fun little game TaliVan reminds me of the well known game Franchise called Flat-out,This game also has some funny humor and runs really decent on my gaming laptop and pretty well optimized when I tried I had it at high graphics.Keep it up developers good job so far!",1
26431,"Reminiscing the times of Newgrounds, AddictingGames, Miniclip, This game fills me with nostalgia for some reason. It gives off a strong progression system akin to those old cannon-shooters, that you get a little better every upgrade purchase. 

I found the game to be hilarious. The physics are broken in just the right way to make it playable, and the gameplay is fairly good. Good little time Killer.

 The not being able to flip over at the start was a real piss-off, and only AFTER buying things did i realize it was intended to be that difficult at the start, with one of the upgrades fixing that issue later. The UI needs work like crazy. No tutorial on what to do, nothing explaining what to do for each level type. For 4.99, it's worth around that price. I've played for a little under an hour so far, and just got to the 3rd level, and tried out ""Road Trip"". I can see what the creators are trying to do, and i understand the processes behind it. If you are looking for something to play on your break, this is the game.",1
26432,"trash, controls horrible, idea horrible, gameplay horrible!",0
26433,Car goes BOOM BOOM!,1
26434,"Hobby, brain teaser, mini-games, fun.

It's not just a game, but a collection of classic mini-games like Search for Objects, Find Differences, Paint, Match, Memory.
 It also contains unique word games: small crossword puzzles, words to look up on the board, or recompose famous phrases.
The ""Connect"" game is nice where you have to join various points to form triangles and create the figure.
Even ""Jigsaw"" you didn't expect the classic, you won't find the usual pieces, but the photo is broken down into many pieces of different shapes.


The graphics are beautiful, and the music never gets boring because there are 15 different tracks to listen to.
In addition to the 22 mini-games in the ""CE Content"" you will find wallpapers to download, music player and 23 additional levels.
The nice thing is that there are no locked levels, it's all manageable by you: decide and choose the minigame you want to play at the moment.
Achievements will be unlocked simply by playing the game and completing levels.
If you're in trouble, click on the star and it will help you.

I have to say that I found these mini-games really fun, there is nothing difficult and it is suitable for everyone, plus it satisfies many different tastes.
I would suggest the idea of creating another collection of mini-games maybe with a more cheerful theme such as animals, flowers, paintings, landscapes, sports etc.

Halloween is my favorite holiday, and Tiny Little Lion Games are some of my favorite games! This game is similar to Stars & Stripes Subgames but with a spooky Halloween vibe. There are no Timers and no Brain-burner puzzles. These are designed to be relaxing Zen games.

I absolutely loved the new Connect the Dots puzzle! This is a puzzle I haven't played before, and it was really fun. I loved the spooky and sometimes adorable Halloween-themed images. Thank You, Tiny Little Lion, for another great game!¬†

26436,"A collection of casual games that are ideal during a quick break.

These types of games are typically found as mini-games in HOGs. There are approximately twenty different mechanics, all of which are well-known and easy to understand. Classics such as jigsaw puzzles, finding differences, memory games, slider puzzles, and many more are included. 

You can choose any puzzle you like because everything is available right away. All you have to do is choose a puzzle mechanic from a list and one of the puzzles in that folder. The only thing missing is the feature to filter out completed from uncompleted puzzles. Because most mechanics only have four puzzles, the selection is somewhat limited. If you're only interested in certain types of puzzles, you probably won‚Äôt find it here. 

Puzzles aren't difficult. But if you get stuck, there‚Äôs a hint to help you arrange one of the pieces in the right place. It recharges over time, allowing you to use it again. As a result, anyone can finish the puzzle.",1

[h1]OBJECTION! Wait, Wrong Game ^^u[/h1]
[b]Erotic Justice[/b] is what you'd get if you grabbed Ace Attorney, gave it a cartoonish art style, cranked up the silliness to eleven, and filled it with absurd jokes. It's a fun romp in which we play as the inspector Max Chusets as he uses his powers to Penetrate The Lies‚Ñ¢ of the people he questions to solve cases. What's more, the game features multiple endings based on different things, such as how well you did in your investigation or if you had an ""accident"" with any of the women in the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3077947440
The mechanics behind the MC's powers are well-though since you only have one shot at using your powers right during a question, and the only way to recharge is by railing any of the women you meet, including your assistant Fizz, or by watching them get down and dirty with each other. Moreover, it includes a luck-based mini-game that determines whether you impregnated someone you had sex with or not.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3077947402
As for the visuals, the cartoonish art style reminded me a bit of that Derpixon animation with the mimes. Maybe it was because of the protagonist's designs, who knows, but I dig the style and the whole cast's character design. Most sex scenes are still shots except for a few animated scenes added here and there to spice things up. The content is vanilla for the most part, though it includes some optional futa scenes in case you're into characters that can offer the best of both worlds. So yeah, give it a shot if you're a fan of Ace Attorney games and always wondered how a porn parody of it would be or if the art style appeals to you, or both.",1
26451,"A pretty good VN, all things considered. Art is simplistic and cute, the story is pretty fun to follow, the characters are all charming in their own way. Being a lewd game, if you're willing to explore, it has a very good spread of fetishes, depending on what you're into. In 3 hours of playing, I played through twice, so there's not some sort of grand narrative to follow, but honestly it doesn't need it. 

I'd prolly give it a 8/10. Give it a try :3",1
26452,"I usually do not leave reviews. However, I did not see a lot of reviews for the game and  I would like to see more content from this developer in the future.  It is not very often you find any voice acting in this style of game and is usually just a cheap put-together cash grab of porn art. But this game put in the effort to include extensive audio content in their game so just because of that alone I would recommend this game. Not to mention I would say the price is about right for the amount of content given.",1

I need to begin this by saying , I don't usually leave long form reviews but felt this game was worth the extra effort to do so.

[b] TL;DR: [/b] a labour of love lewd visual novel with cute graphic design and a fantastic plot, well worth your money, sale or not.

Erotic justice is a lewd visual novel in three acts. You'll spend your time looking for clues , attempting to solve three separate mystery's that reveal an overarching plot. Although it is possible to ignore or skip though the dialogue the player is rewarded for paying attention and overall pays to a better experience with the game.

[b] Art style [/b]
Despite the fact that on first glance, the art may appear minimalist, it serves well to the games style and is clearly a labour of love. Each character has a unique and memorable design that pops and the lewd scenes are beautifully illustrated and animated. The hand drawn characters are contrasted to a 3D rendered background that initially, was jarring but slowly grew on me as I spent further time with the game. Whilst strange at first, the simplicity of the rendered backgrounds works in its favour, enhancing the colourful pop art style of the game.

[b] Lewd Scenes [/b]
As mentioned above , the lewd scenes expectantly , contain some of the best drawn scenes in the game. Most of the scenes are still images with small changes to match dialogue and infer action , but there is a larger portion than I had expected that were animated. Unlocking the entire scene gallery takes multiple playthroughs, and is something to be aware of if you enjoy being able to view the entire gallery. The lewd scenes, much like the game itself, manage to carry with them an overt sense of humour that does not detract  and in most cases compliments the moment.

[b] Plot [/b]
The narrative is by far, one of the best I have seen in a lewd game as of late. It's rare to find time and effort put into a lewd game to this extent let alone such careful steps taken with the world. I significantly enjoyed my time immersed within the stories and the characters. Both kept my attention well , and I found myself caught off guard at times by some of the narrative turns that were taken. The main character has an interesting gimmick that blends well into the overarching plot and gameplay to keep the player immersed. The humour employed was entertaining and worked well for the world they had created.

[b] Voice Acting [/b]
There isn't too much to say in this segment. The voice acting that the game has is of a high quality for a game of this size and a game of this price. It can be a little repetitive at times due to some phrases being repeated when talking to characters but its mostly able to be ignored. My largest criticism, when at first I playing through the story, the narrator would be jarring enough in quality drop in comparison to the rest of the voice acting cast that I would be immediately brought out of any level of immersion I was experiencing. Fortunately their voice lines are far enough between that it rarely comes up. It needs to be said that although the quality difference may be obvious they are still clearly trying and do a good job regardless.

[b] Final Notes [/b]
I usually review games with the idea of their achievements or collectables in mind and although disappointingly, there were none to be found here , I still greatly enjoyed my time with this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality lewd game. It's a labour of love and it clearly shows as you playthrough what it has to offer. I look forward to what this developer has to offer in the future and future exploration into this world of theirs!",1
26459,"Fun game with plenty to do and see if you get what I mean, can tell a lot of love was put into it so I'll put lots of love in them",1

Oh! The games pretty good too...",1
26461,"I am usually not the biggest fan of mystery games nor am I the best at them, but I enjoy this one (for more than one reason lol). The art style is charming and I was pleasantly surprised that some of the H-scenes were animated--though I still need to unlock them all. 

I recommend~",1
26462,"Delightful writing. Fun to play. 
Not all of the cases were easy to figure out and I like that.
Plenty of replay-ability if you want to find every scene and get the biggest ending.",1
26463,"An erotic game where you actually play as a detective?! Crazy but its true. A mystery needs to be solved and your the guy for the job. The characters a unique enough that everyone will have a favorite and the dialogue is top notch! You'll feel like a detective working through puzzles and listening to dialogue to figure out who done did it. Of course the ""erotic"" part of Erotic Justice doesn't disappoint. All in all a pretty good game you need to pay attention and think about the right answers. Definitely recommend! 

Also Merlot is best girl, fight me",1
26464,"I'll be honest here. I've never given the time of day to play a visual novel, let alone an 18+ one. It was one of those genres of games where I didn't get the appeal at first.

But after playing [i] Erotic Justice [/i] after a recommendation from a friend, I can happily confirm that Erotic Justice is a great time through and through! The dialogue is written very well. The characters designs are top notch (big ups to Teliodraw and Ringumu for bringing these characters to life). The voice acting in this game is really good. The music smooths the senses. Some of the detective work makes you feel like you're an actual detective! And of course, the sex scenes are very... well, erotic! Some of the sex animations are animated well, too! Not to mention, this game is hilarious! You'll be horny while having a good laugh by the time you reach the credits!

Needless to say, [i] Erotic Justice [/i] was a lot of fun and a great entry point for those wanting to jump into the world of VNs! I wholeheartedly recommend it to those wanting to get down and dirty while also have a laugh along the way!



Also Cham is best girl, don't @ me.",1

26476,"As of now, quite the narrow gap separates this ""recommended"" rating from a ""not recommended"" one.

Interestingly, it even features both a Vampire Survivors-esque timed mode and a Brotato-inspired round-based one, though the latter doesn't feel as polished or well-designed all in all. There isn't anything blatantly wrong with the game, hence the narrow recommendation of mine, though it does feel a little slow and enemy variety is pretty low, rendering the matches a bit repetitive. There's also no permanent upgrades or anything of the sort yet, thus after beating both modes once I felt like I saw most everything. I plan on revisiting the game in the future because there's some quality in here that can be iterated upon.

26485,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
The Sweetest Ring is a linear visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You were finally able to purchase one of the new 3D TVs due to it being on sale, at a massive discount. You don't have to wear glasses to get the 3D effect. Unfortunately, even on sale, the TV cost a lot of money and you only had enough left to purchase a 3D movie from the discount bin. When you get your purchases home and get everything connected you put your new movie in. At first you think it is broken, as all you get is snow on the screen. Then a long haired girl crawls out of the screen, these 3D effects are just amazing. You back up and move around the room. Sayako, the girl, tells you that she's coming to kill you. It's just a movie‚Ä¶until she touches you.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Eventually you get to the point where you introduce yourself to Sayako and enter your name. I use the space bar to advance the text, so I didn't notice until the cursor started moving. This is the only interaction you have with the game.

The English is good. I didn't notice any spelling or grammar issues.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are seven scenes in the Gallery, which is accessed from the title or save menu. All of them are images from NTR scenes, without the text. The one scene with you and Sayako isn't in the gallery.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
This is an short NTR game. The concept is interesting, you release a girl's ghost from a cursed video disc and end up in a relationship with her‚Ä¶then she finds your porn.

[h1]System Specs[/h1]
CPU: AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 9 7950X3D
Motherboard: Gigabyte X670E AORUS EXTREME (rev. 1x)
RAM: G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo Series (AMD Expo) DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB)
Video: ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4080

*Non-Consensual, for the purposes of this review is a non-consensual or coerced act.  It doesn't matter if she gets into after you start.  In the real world these actions may result in jail time.",1
26487,"[code]A review copy was provided by the developer, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42762384]Infidelisoft[/url].[/code]

[h1]Cucked by The Ring[/h1]
[b]The Sweetest Ring[/b] is an NTR-oriented VN about a guy who meets Sadako, a ghost girl residing in the cursed video he tested his brand-new TV with, and eventually marries her. However, boredom pushed Sadako to explore the protagonist's DVD collection, unaware of the sexy fun times that awaited her in that unmarked DVD.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3168746029
It's similar to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nikkunamesu/recommended/2358490]Goblin Down[/url] as it's also a short kinetic novel that you can beat in under an hour. Even so, the story is entertaining from the beginning to the end because of the sheer absurdity of the plot. For starters, the only reason the protagonist wasn't scared of her when they met was because he mistook her for some hyperrealistic effects he imagined his new TV had, utterly shocking her. What's more, her interactions with the many porn movies she goes in are hilarious as she sometimes isn't aware of what she got into, and other times she does what it takes to alter it just enough to get herself rawdogged.

On another note, the game's visuals are nothing short of beautiful as Sadako's character sprite and the many CGs with her in it are gorgeous, the glitchy effects used at the start of the VN are top-notch, and all sex scenes are nicely animated. As for the sex scenes, it has the usual stuff you'd expect: blowjobs, facials, group sex, etc, while also featuring a scene in which the protagonist sees his wife take a pounding like a champ.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3168801055
[h1]Verdict: Decent[/h1]
Some may find The Sweetest Ring too short for its price, but the quality of the visuals and how fun its plot is justifies getting it at full price. If a bite-sized NTR kinetic visual novel is what you're looking for, then consider giving it a shot.

26488,"A short VN with the scary girl from the haunted well.

Disclaimer: Because most adult visual novels, or visual novels in general, use the same engine, I won't go into detail about the technical aspects. All you need to know is that you can save the game at any moment and that you can skip every piece of text right from the start. Having said that, the engine is customized enough to give the appearance of a unique game. I also like that the overall style, from font selection to main menu, fits the old video tapes feel.

The game itself involves the well-known scene where the girl from a horror movie comes out of the TV screen. More specifically, the meme or fantasy where the scary girl turns out to be a very hot chick. Since you play a dummy who think this whole thing looks so real because of the new TV with the latest 3D technology, you take advantage of it for your personal pleasure.

The story‚Äôs pretty entertaining. It has some fun parts, like when you shut off the TV while the girl is climbing back inside and her behind is left sticking out. It also switches between your and the girl‚Äôs perspective. Since she has the ability to enter any video, it turns out the girl is an even bigger pervert because she enjoys going into porn movies. 
The game doesn‚Äôt take long and there are no decisions. It‚Äôs just a short story that can be experienced in a single sitting.",1
26489,"It's a nice little story, very short (about 30 minutes to complete), no choices.
But it's NTR, it's kinda expected from the devs, i liked futature a lot so i tried this one, it's not on the same quality but it's fine.

Not recommended if you don't like NTR",1
26490,"A short adult VN (30ish minutes).  There isn't really any game play, as the story is linear (no options for varying choices).  The art isn't bad.  The story is a neat concept.  Overall, nothing great but if it looks interesting to you, you'll probably enjoy it.  Recommend picking up on sale.  Ran fine on the Steam Deck, no issues at all.",1
26491,"It's pretty straightforward as far as AVNs go. A bit on the short side, which feels like some untapped potential considering how they used the ghost woman's powers. It easily lends itself to more scenes/ideas, but hey, you can't go wrong for 5 bucks, it's pretty entertaining with good artwork. Just wish there was more is all.",1
26492,"All the scenes are in the trailer and even if I didn't skip to see the scenes and read each word like a 90yr old vet I'd still finish under 2 hours and be just as bored as one, just play and refund, nothing interesting either from what I did read.",0

You'll travel(walk) most of the time(at least from the very first few quest I finished) which can take you up to 5-15 minutes per location, on an empty field with a game design that looks like it was released on early 2000's. Its definitely not worth $20.

26505,"Since I already reviewed the first part, the same review is valid for Episode 2 because everything is the same. The only difference that instead of an apartment complex, you now explore the police station.

Gameplay remains the same. You need to walk up and down the building, talk to people, and bring them what they want. It‚Äôs easy to miss anything because there‚Äôs a flashing yellow visual clue when you get near a person or something interesting. You get to grab a few items that are used automatically when you interact with the right spot.

The game‚Äôs world is a mix of real and magical, so you‚Äôll meet a few new mythical creatures and scan them for more information. This adds a bit more meat to the story but isn‚Äôt important.",1

The game is harder than it looks!

Keyboard keys (PC Layout):

--D/Right to go Right
--J to Jump
--R to Restart
--M to change music
--ENTER to skip cinematic
--Spacebar to play/pause cinematic
--ESC to Quit
(you need to tap J to jump higher)

It also has a fun intro and characters in the background that some of you might recognize along the way.

26511,"I applaud the novelty and the boldness to do something differently, but I don't think the game lives up to its potential.

This is a text mystery game. It plays by you clicking on objects or locations and getting new options or items to use, which lets you progress and make choices and discover different endings to the mystery. 

Sounds good really. But it wasn't interesting enough, it wasn't clear enough what the options were, and in general I'm not one to replay the same exact story just to get a different ending.

It's cheap so I'd say give it a shot for yourself, it might click better with you.",0

Even if you're not going to deep dive into every individual cases and try to unlock their every endings, it's worth it even if you're just going to try every provided mysteries once for the uniqueness of the concept, but if you do want to explore the each mysteries deeper, there's a lot of time you can spend here.",1
26514,"I have not played any text-based games in years, and this is honestly a diamond in disguise. 

Apparently it was translated to English not too long ago, so you cannot find many information in this language (google translate can work its magic on that!), but do not focus on that and explore the game itself.

There are 3 main stories, and lots more that can be accessed through the workshop (may be in Chinese though). Many possible scenarios, almost each move creates a new branch in the story line, with each story getting more deep and intricate. 

Some achievements are easy to get by progressing through the story and unlocking ends, some others require repetition.

26517,"At first I was interested in this game because it seemed to be an interesting story exploration. I played the tutorial and the first proper level. Playing the first level took a little more time than playing the tutorial and after that I was told that there are 7 endings for the first level. I managed to get 4 which are easy and then just tried getting different endings for about 20 minutes but all I did in the end is replay the level with the same outcome. It's like 'sing me a song but if you fail a note I won't tell you which one it was so keep trying'.
Secrets in other games are hidden on a map where you can search for them without punishment if you fail. You walk by you can come back. In this game it feels like secrets are hidden in time which sounds cool but if you miss it you have to redo the entire sequence. The first time on the proper level I got to a garden and vaguely remembered how I started the level but I could never get back to it.
UI is fine, controls are fine, concept is interesting but the content just didn't work for me.",0

If you do that too, I'd like to warn you that there is no wiki and the 4 guides for the game are in Chinese, I think, and they're for achievements and the story mode. All the discussion posts are Chinese too (except for, like, 4 English ones and a single one that I can't recognize.) So, yeah, the game is not English friendly. But it does have English built in, so it isn't keeping you out. All in all, seems like a great game. I just wish I could learn to use the level editor.",1

26532,"For all the underwhelming programming that I experienced in this game, I see a lot of good ideas overshadowed by a junky design, if anything the game lacks polish more than it lacks vision, if you clean up the game and adjust how you build the tension, it could go from being ""whatever"" to being pretty good. As I was playing I constantly felt like it reminded me of Puppet Combo games, and then I realized it is actually listed as the inspiration, so I am like ah, now it makes more sense, and honestly, even if you just did more testing to fix the technical issues and improve the slower parts of the game when building that atmosphere, I think it would not be that far away from the Puppet Combo, you like 60% there, which may not sound like a complement, but it's not that I didn't like the experience overall, I think you got a lot of smaller moments wrong, not the overall feel of the story.

Obviously, there are a lot of technical issues, I am sure you are already aware of those, you can definitely improve on making better hotspots, like trying to put the stool at the right angle or grab the powder next to the door, just overall finding the correct place to interact was a consistent problem within the game. On that note, since the save system is a bit unpredictable, I wish you gave us some unlockable chapters as well. 

To be honest, I am not a huge fan of the whole ""stalker"" trope, it's almost a subgenre of horror games now, so many of them, sometimes it's a coffee place, sometimes it's a gas station, or something else, but always with the same premise. That said, using the whole survival-horror aesthetic instead of doing it first person is a welcome change, and I think you did enough foreshadowing to actually reflect on the first several days and realize there were constant clues. I think the second half of the game worked a lot better, I enjoyed the vibes a lot more from the start of the party and all the way toward the end, and I think it even had a few neat moments that can get your attention. There were a few moments that I think you could have done better, for example, the first time you see him over the fence (2 of them actually), I don't think they work that well because you just show his model from a distance, maybe if you at least gave him a better entry into the scene, make him show up the first time from a camera angle you can't see, and then make him follow you, with a nice subtle jump scare. Whenever you let the player have a good look at the killer and realize it's just a model it will hurt the suspense, that is something I think you need to work around, or at least use those moments more sparingly. I also think you could give him a nice sound effect of screaming when he gets hurt by a knife.

I usually love tank controls and fixed camera angles, although this game was not the best representation of this craft. I will say that I liked some of the perspective changes, like the following camera in the long corridor, you are getting some of them correctly, but I think mixing them poorly with open areas where you were unable to create those long shots was not working in your favor, perhaps a bird view perspective would have worked better there - it's almost like you have a bad habit of placing the camera a bit too low if that makes sense. Maybe if you had more narrow locations you could get more creative with them, you know like the alley camera follow in Silent Hill, something like that, open area, but give yourself some objects to work with.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) To be fair I think the game got my attention a few times, not always for the right reasons, but I liked some of the silly and edgy moments in the narrative. I also liked some of the foreshadowing which was not apparent until I completed the game. I do think the slow burn with the boring tasks is a nice element for a game like this, I just think you made them a bit clunky so it was hard to focus on the atmosphere. 

(+) You not getting the fixed camera angles as well as I would like, but there were occasional locations where it looked a lot better, like the corridor or the church. I mean, maybe just go back to those classics and pay attention to where they place the camera relative to the character, sometimes I felt like you placed it too low or not showing the angle that I needed to see. 

(+) The game has some multiple endings, I didn't do all of them. A few optional things as well.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

I kind of already mentioned it in the review, but obviously, the technical issues, make the hotspots easier to use, and make the walking a bit easier so she does not stagger as often. Some of the camera angles look good and others feel like you had no idea where to place the camera, maybe it was too low sometimes, I think whenever you would place a fixed angle it would feel better like that shot in the corridor with doors or the church. When it comes to the killer, you probably want to avoid giving the player that feel like he is a model in the distance, there has to be a better way to use him, maybe if he would appear over the fence with a jump scare, and then he would chill around. I felt like he needed a sound effect for getting hurt when you cut him.

Another small thing, sometimes you would have dark corners or angles with low detail, my thought on this is that surface with a texture will always look better, you can still make it low res and dark, but whenever I feel like something has nothing there, to me it feels like more cutting corners on not adding detail, so I always want to see a bit of extra effort there and make sure I can see the design of the room.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]

Honestly, the game didn't make a good first impression, and there were many clunky moments, but I still see some redeeming qualities, keep working on it, and don't neglect the interactive side of the game so I am not there for 20 minutes trying to pick up the item, and just be more careful with those ""killer appearance moments"" so you not draining the tension. With a bit more practice, I think you could make games of similar quality to Puppet Combo.

26533,"Good PSX-like horror game, I would have liked it to be longer but on the other hand its price is very good.
The first half does an excellent work in creating a very tense atmosphere that works perfectly as a build-up for what it's going to happen. The actual gameplay is kinda janky but still manageable. I appreciated how the developer was very quick to fix and address bugs and suggestions.

It is notable that the game also acts as a social commentary, depicting, between crudeness and satire, the hardships that women have to face not only in extreme cases (like with the game's stalker/killer), but also in daily life with ""normal"" men.
This creates a sick and disturbing atmosphere that permeates every moment of the game, blurring the line between horror and realism (also accentuated by the lines you see during loading time and when you die, lines that are depressingly familiar and still too much common).",1
26534,"Pros:
-It's edgy/ironic in its presentation, but not controversial. All the points are pretty agreeable: Women aren't believed when they're assaulted, women are disproportionately Harassed on the job, lesbians are called terrible things by incels that cant frick em, Etc‚Ä¶
-From what I read on the devs patreon, the art isn't AI. It's all scanned copies of the devs actual art, and It's all pretty unique.
-The price to content ratio can't be beat
Cons:
-The game has a slow-burn start. There is foreshadowing etc that the beginning levels set up, but it doesn't get dark until the later half of the game.
-The Stationary cameras suck at default settings.
-The tank controls suck at default settings.
-The launch bugs weren't great‚Ä¶ but they seem to have been fixed mostly
-Optional content, but lacking lore

For the Devs:
Polish polish polish. You seem to have done a few rounds of updates and you've gotten a better game out of every one. Why didn't you start with more play tests instead of jumping the gun on release? Also there's a bug where the bathroom door won't open unless you exit to main and relaunch after you find something in the tub.

For the players:
If you're looking for an edgy commentary on how women are treated when they're attacked, this is your jam. Heed the game's initial launch warning, however. It is definitely for mature audiences.

I've heard rumours that it's not Twitch TOS safe, but from what I've read that's not true as long as you have a mature content warning, because it's just naked art on the wall.

There are 4 different endings you can get in the game. I got 1. The feminine rage ending is damn cathartic for survivors. You can tell the developer gave every ounce of her own rage when writing it. That doesn't mean it won't be uncomfortable, but there's something special about a game that can make you feel so deeply. Props to the dev for being so vulnerable and saying what nobody else will. I hope they make their social media public again when they realise they're safe <3",1
26535,Normaly i dont really write serious reviews but this game gives the player an extremely unsettling feeling which makes it a great horror game. The red text during the loading screen is a fantastic idea when it comes to what the game is about. The developers did a great job!,1
26536,"This game is amazing, such a great horror game. i love the ps1 (psx) stylized graphics. Sound work is well done, gameplay is great, unsettling moments. this game can be upsetting to some, so trigger warning with this game, but, for me this game was a prefect game. 10/10.",1
26537,"To be honest, I don't know whenever I should recommend this game. It has a nice plot, is a PS style horror, buttt

1. it's hard to control a character; I understand that it relates to camera that games released in previous century had, but it doesn't mean that games should't evolve. Stopping rotation when you use a gamepad is meh
2. it has some bugs,
2.1. character models spawn in the late game after reload, while they shouldn't be there. It confused me a lot, I replayed that part a couple of times for that reason
2.2. sometimes interactive options just disappear, i.e. with a lighter
3. last interactive section isn't obvious, it seems like you can't use knife there, but it was quite unobvious, also I would reposition camera a bit",1
26538,"The game was ok a few annoyances here and there being the awkward movement when moving around such as when you run to turn its as if she is running into a wall before finally going forward but for some reason when you push the cleaning cart the movement around is smooth? Another one was picking up the trash one at a time as well as the cups one at a time after the part felt like padding to extend the game and the other issue being you can't have the flashlight be on while you have the knife out despite it being on your shoulder.

Graphically the game was alright and the cut scenes were good. PSX filter would of been nice but it was disabled from what I read and the main antagonist of the game wasn't scary at all could of benefited from a cut scene of him spotting you for the first time and is very easy to tell where he is due to him whistling and if you are quick enough with the knife all it takes is one slash for him to run away. Main menu could of been better designed though as it feels low effort 

Overall the game was ok but this is a simplistic horror game with not much going on with it

26539,"70 min total playtime, where 50min is ""motel-made-simulator"", 20min is ""hide and seek"". 
You actually lost me before 30min of playtime, but i decided to give another chance and now i say - no, just no.
Terrible implementation of tank control on top of the even worse ""static-dynamic"" camera. 
Start of the game is very slow, tedious and overwhelming.
If you are approached by an enemy in a ""Survival sequence""  - it is required from you a pixel-perfect execution of attack, which is almost impossible since animation and controls are very clunky.
Interaction with npc/items requires a pixel perfect position.
Sometimes you can interact with objects through the walls.

26550,"I have some gripes but for a ¬£1.69 game, it was very very good and with a lot of content. Take the trigger warnings seriously, this is absolutely ""Dark"" romance that cannot be avoided in any playthrough, and the Devs were right to include the initial warning and disclaimer. Had me genuinely unsettled in some scenes, and even though the ""timed"" answers were a joke with the mousewheel allowing me all the time in the world to respond, I was quick saving like a huge coward. 

The writing is well done, albeit the stories are a little unimaginative. I like that it asked our genders and pronouns and disclaimed that they would be sexualised - it's a spoiler, somewhat, but I appreciate it being there to protect people's comfort with gender dysphoria. The art, whilst sometimes crude, changed perfectly for a little psycho and matched the tone well when they ""snapped"". 

It's not perfect, of course. It's cheap, so there's no voice acting. The menu to save and load is a nightmare and you're constantly trapped in a loop unless you press escape. There's broken achievements, so you cannot 100% this right now (unless you used an achievement manager like some people have). There's ""achievements"" and endings in the game that don't have achievements on steam, and it's inconsistent. Probably most people won't notice that, but I wrote a guide the entire time I played it, so I did notice. They also have barely any CGs and the CG slots they do have are repeated in both routes - I wouldn't have cared if there was simply less to unlock, but having multiple blank unlockables that turned out to be the same exact image felt really boring and disappointing considering how much I was enjoying them.

I also think the game itself is way too weighted towards Jak, but he's apparently a character in another game not yet on steam, so whilst I felt he was too focused on for nothing special, I can understand a good call-back getting more endings than the character I preferred - Wade. 

This flew under the radar for most and was released on steam with very little fan-fare because it was released on itch.io previously. Very reminiscent of Amnesia: Memories and Toma's route in that, and there's so many dead ends that it also reminds me of First Bite, only a lot cheaper. Regardless, I enjoyed my time with this and I'm absolutely going to buy their next game.",1

26554,"Not gonna lie, a pretty underwhelming game. Trust when I say I wanna give it a good review cuz ""muh indie game"" but, even after 100%ing it i kinda lowkey regret putting literally four hours into it lol. 

The artwork is of varying quality with visual bugs occasionally popping up in my runs. Ui is amateurish with things like the load button being really hard to see on certain screens, and it unavailable in the pause menu, strangely enough. 
Didn't really care for one whole half of the characters, that being Wade (just couldnt match his freak ig). The fact that theres only two characters that you interact with would've been fine imo if Wade were a stronger character. Fully knowledge it could just be my personal preferences blinding me so take that idea with a grain of salt.
Theres good moments in the writing but the lack of variety in scenery and things to do made getting different endings and dialogues a mundane experience since a lot of them are all the same.

Again, I hate saying I wouldnt reccomend it, but I'd rather have spent the 2$ on a more engaging vn. This isn't to say it isnt promising, but I just wouldnt pay for what feels like a veryvery beginner's renpy thing. I'll still be getting any future games from the dev cause im def kinda interested despite Lover's Trophy's pitfalls (haha pitfalls get it...)

26555,"ignore my playtime! I bought this game on itch.io a few months ago and now it's on steam, i couldn't help myself.there areso many branches to go down in both wade and jak's routes; if you are curious and you like murdersims/survival dating sims, this is perfect for you. not to mention pronouns, chest, and genital options.

26556,Took me about 4 hours to 100% but it was fully worth it. The game was entertaining and was thrilling to play. It's definitely worth the cost. I really recommend it fully as a horrorporn game and a visual novel in general. It was fun to solve the combinations to get the endings you want. This is definitely not a game for the lighthearted. My minor critic has to be that it sometimes lacks in the horror department. I personally wish there was more onscreen gore but that's just me. The game in general was an enjoyable experience and I will be recommending it to my closet friends who are also into this genre of games.,1
26557,"the only reason i bought this is because its on BTD wiki page as ""BTD inspired games"", but... im actually a bit disappointed, there are too many surviving endings.. yea i know its crazy to complain about survival endings, but come on, this is not like BTD at all, like where is the horror? the surprising death ending that makes you feel challenged to stay alive? like this game is the opposite, i had to try harder to unlock death ending instead of survival ending. i know $1 isnt much but there are many free BTD inspired games that are better... i still would suggest people to buy this though, simply because you need to support the devs if you want them to make more games like this, the community is already so obscure as is.",0

",1
26583,"I enjoyed my short time with this game. I am not usually a platformer-type gamer, but this one had enough unique mechanics to keep it more interesting than just running and jumping. 

Starting out, I took me a tiny bit to get used to the control scheme. They're not bad or unfamiliar, but I did not realize I could change the keybinds until I was nearly 45 minutes in (I kept clicking on the leaf with the key instead of the leaf stating the action). Changing my tether to my mouse helped me get farther, but I think that is because of my FPS-goober brain.

The music was good enough for the duration I played, but I hope more tracks come with future updates! The audio options are more robust than I thought they would be by having multiple sliders for master, music, hostiles, game.

Graphics are good and the aesthetics are cool. I dig the different environments and having the objectives fit/change with the setting is a nice touch. The menu feels like a 'ye olde' flash game and I hope to see it evolve. That being said, I don't exactly know if that is the style, but the text is affected by this, so it could be difficult for some to read certain prompts or story beats.

Overall, the game will improve in time and more will be added, but it gave me a good first impression. I'll have to get this installed on my Steam Deck and see how well it works on the go!",1
26584,"This game oozes with stylization and the music is no exception. I'd actually listened to this soundtrack on repeat for nearly a whole day before I even had the chance to play the game for the first time. Lots of jazz-fusion, but especially fused with nu-disco for the faster tempo stuff. Might remind you of Bayonetta and Mahou Arms and Persona 5?

26588,"Take my words with a grain of salt till the developer spends some more time optimizing the game and more updates come out. I'm just posting my impressions and thoughts.

I'll be honest, this game conceptually absolutely rocks and is right up my alley. It's like if someone said decided to fuse Devil May Cry's combat and the Atelier series' aesthetics and visual design, with hints of NIS and the Tales games. There's also the fact that this is free, to which my experience freeplay games on Steam aren't always the best, so this came as a surprise. I love Character Action Game style titles and this scratches an oddly specific but still enjoyable itch. Good on the dev, I would pay for more stuff like this.

As of when this review is posted, the game is getting continual updates that increase its stability. I've played so far only on Steam Deck and its slowly eased out over time, although it's still a bit of a roulette when the game will croak. I've had some issues with the menus and viewing certain things like moves and so on, so I'd hope that's fixed soon. 

All in all though, I would say that this game looks damn cool, and its got a quality charm to it with the amount of stuff right out the gate like voice-acting, a style meter, turbo mode, etc. Try it out once the developer cleans up it after awhile, it's a pleasant, if small (and kinda shaky) surprise.",1
26589,"As it says in the title, this game is a prototype and as such is rough around the edges and understandably might have some bugs here and there as well. While the prominent things that happened to me were mainly just the characters getting stuck in places and having to reload old save files, it's clear that this game still needs some time to cook and work out its kinks. Once it does work out said kinks, this honestly has a lot of potential. Between the beautiful world design, realistic and heartfelt story/dialogue and a combat system that has a lot of depth to it (none of which I found myself really able to fully grasp honestly), this is a game that's worth keeping an eye on as it continues to get updated.",1
26590,"[THE THUMBS DOWN IS ONLY FOR THE TECHNICAL BUGS, NOT THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY]

The game's UI, character design, artwork, music, action, and environments are all charming and I really want to like this game but the software itself really needs heavy working on. 

It's basically a roll of the dice what goes wrong with each time I restart the game
-Sometimes the music doesn't play at all
-Sometimes the game chugs a bunch during combat
-It never seems to remember whenever I change the inputs or audio volume, every time I either load a save or start a new game, the controls go back to default
-When I press A to show the full dialogue in the text box, it ends the voice audio. Sometimes it doesn't even advance the dialogue but it still ends the voice audio.
-The list of places that the game's stopped responding from both controller and keyboard/mouse range from in the ""skip cutscene"" confirmation box, in the change input menu, way too many times in post-battle rating screen, etc.

26591,"game 200/20
quality of life 0/20
an incredible and complete game, but with a lot of bad things in UI and keyboard play (Play with the controller!).
how can this game be so under-represented?",1
26592,"This is a neat little demo, with a nice graphical direction, two well fleshed out characters for how little of the game exists so far, and some fun combat.  The art style is pretty without being overbearing, the effects look nice even if it's hard for me to tell what kind of attack the enemy is trying to use.  The environment is needlessly large, and the very indistinguishable environmental objects make it easy to get turned around from a camera reset after battle.  The main character is given enough dialogue to make a very ""ragna the bloodedge"" kind of character, at least from the initial look at her, and the slime friend cements their role as a silent companion foil to the talkative protagonist.  The voice acting is well done, though the battle voice lines are a bit too frequent with how basic attack heavy the game seems to be.  On the topic of combat, it feels really good when you're on the offensive.  There's very little feedback when you hit something making the combat feel floaty, but the basic attack chain is satisfying.  Being able to reposition as needed during it or interrupt with special attacks gives the feeling that you should always be basic attacking, using specials and charge attacks when you feel it would help when you need to stunlock something.  Being able to dodge mid combo without interrupting but also dodge at the end of a combo to remove end lag feels really good, partially because it feels rewarding to learn when to dodge to maximize that sweet sweet DPS, but it doesn't feel excessively punishing to miss the window.  Defensive combat gets a lot more rough, unfortunately.  If you get knocked up at all, there's not really anything you can do, no dodging out of laying on your butt and no invulnerability frames when you're waiting to stand up.  For slower line AoEs, this can lead to you getting juggled across the battle arena from full to dead, which would be less of an issue if it wasn't for the needlessly complex warning system.  As of right now, enemies flash one of four colors to indicate what they're going to do, and keeping track of this while maintaining your attacks is certainly a system that's learnable, but the colors can be very difficult to see amidst all the particles from your own attacks.  While this may encourage a more reaction based playstyle, every other aspect of combat promotes extreme aggression.  

Overall, I'm excited to see how this project turns out.

The only game breaking bug I found was an issue where I paused the game and it wouldn't accept any other inputs, just after the tutorial fight but before being told our little slime friend had joined the party",1
26593,"Aside from some minor technical issues like menu names buggering up, it seems most of the bugs have been fixed, hence why I gave the game another go as of late.

First of all, I love the aesthetic and tone. Yelette is a wonderfully fun character. She absolutely reeks of early 2000s deviantArt edgy JRPG OC energy‚Äîshe's the ""Lord of Nightmares"" and has a single black wing that pops out for special attacks, for crying out loud‚Äîbut she's also keenly aware of this, even having pages in her journal dedicated to awful one-liners and phrases to say to her enemies to sound cool. They do not sound cool at all; they are too long and lack eloquence and flow, and my trained literary eye does not determine these flaws to be on purpose. However, since Yelette trying too hard to be cool is part of her character, it actually turns out to work, so props to the devs.

I like her monologues. I love her awesome clothes. I even like the brief interactions she has with others that make her seem gracious and good-natured without being an idiot that makes a fool out of herself, nice social traits that a lot of JRPG heroes of the early 2000s lacked. I especially like that she's a world-saving hero and this lil' prototype is about her on a fetch quest for the sake of her sister. Yelette takes it all in stride and it's fun. She is the sort of character that I've come to want to know more about just from reading about her journal entries. I'm captivated.

Combat's not bad but it needs an overhauled control scheme. I see the [u]Devil May Cry[/u] influences clear as day but these bloody direction-sensitive controls aren't working for me and I can't pull off the attacks I'm trying to pull off. What [b]especially[/b] doesn't work is the tutorial system. I do not care who you are; I am not going to start a game and patiently read and try to memorise [b]nine pages of basic combat mechanics[/b]. I'm especially not going to do that for six tutorials in a row! Please, tutorialise us on mechanics [i]as we are introduced to them[/i], not all at once. We also need examples, because a lot of the mechanics do not make sense upon first reading.

Sadly, I found myself losing interest rapidly after a certain point. I gathered all the ingredients, returned to camp, and was graced with a long cutscene before something happened and I was taken straight to a boss fight. I don't know why I couldn't have been made to travel there, perhaps save my game and prepare my equipment and perhaps do anything else that I wanted to do beforehand because the autosaves don't work right, because now I was up against a boss that was killing me in a single hit and I didn't know what I was doing. I'm not particularly invested in the idea of going back.

It would be nice if we could jump around the world map. There are times when I'd like to jump up and down a ledge or a slope or over a fence without having to need to run around it. This would also open up the world design a bit and make exploring more fun. That said, I think there might be a crafting system and that fills me with dread. I don't like crafting systems in general but that's not helped at all by the game's user interface, which requires me to make a few too many clicks just to navigate menus; there's an awful lot of going in and out of menus that I'd rather not do. 

Speaking of, when the game starts, you're introduced to the Options menu. It would be nice if the top left of the screen wasn't covered by a ""Start game"" button so I could see what's being obscured under there because I figure it could be important. Heck, the first time I played, I skipped it because I thought ""I'll just get to the area map and go back to the Options menu from there and figure it out"". Then I had to go through two cutscenes, a tutorial fight (complete with the nine pages mentioned above), and then TWO MORE CUTSCENES before I could finally access the Options menu again. Like I said with the boss fight above, it could've helped if I could've travelled a bit between the two cutscenes so that I had a moment to get my bearings in-game.

[u]Horizon to Crinoa[/u] has a strong foundation for its writing and tone. It's the mechanics and programming that most concern me. But I am eager all the same to see where this goes.",1
26594,"I think this game is generally pretty solid. The gameplay is great, the story is decently good so far, and the complaints I do have are mostly directed at some bugs and general 'scaling'.
As somebody who doesn't fight literally everything in my path, the Chilchek fight felt awkward, since they would constantly two-shot me. On top of that, I'm not sure if it's a bug or otherwise, but there were times in that fight where I would be stuck dashing in a single direction and starting the animation for Ragna Blade. Apart from that fight, the audio mixing is a little weird, with the magic activation noise being incredibly loud compared to just about everything else, apart from more minor things.
Overall though, I'm giving this a positive because I'd genuinely love to see where this game goes in the future, and I'll keep my eye on it for its high potential.",1
26595,"Okay so I'm going to redo the first half of this review because the more I play the more I have to say.

This game has one major problem that is less of a ""early access"" problem and more of a ""design direction"" problem. I understand wanting a complex combat system, but the combat is far too flashy and fast paced to have all the systems going on at once that it does. When I saw the combat tutorial 3 and all of the 10 pages of colored enemy flashes, types of cancels, strange parry terms that seem overly complicated when simplified terms that are more understandable would work, etc. I realized that the devs are overly bloating the combat system.

This is a problem because, even in the combat in which that tutorial appeared for me, even SEEING red flashes from an enemy would have been impossible. The enemy is a red slime with big red visual effects that would easily disguise anything like that. Between that and all of the special effects on the main character's attacks and the extremely fast pace of combat this game is borderline impossible beyond mashing buttons and hoping.

This is not helped by the fact that enemies are damage sponges and you are DEFINITELY not. I have gone from full health to 0 in a single combo against basic enemies. I'm not saying you can't have a complex combat system, but if you do it needs to be slowed down a bit, particularly on the part of the enemies, and visuals need to be cleaned up enough to be able to SEE the complex visual indicator system and tell the difference between what is a visual effect of an attack and what is a notification of an attack.

I think a good solution would be to reserve the flashy effects for big important moves. Look towards games like Sekiro, for instance. It has a pretty simple enemy indicator system, but it's easy to visually see and stands out starkly, plus the only big flashy effects are your special attacks and most enemies' attacks pause with the indicator before unleashing the move. Perhaps this is happening in this game, but if it is, it's too difficult to tell against two red slimes with red attack visuals and red indicators overlapping one another.

I do still like the concept of this game and I think this is very impressive for a new developer. The animation and effects look nice, the voice acting is surprisingly good, it looks very nice and animates well, there's just a number of more mechanical issues the game has that I think go beyond simply not being finished yet and more are problems of visual design and some of the chosen direction. I do also think perhaps narrowing down the amount of cancels in the game would be very beneficial... having four types of cancel is a bit much. It's somewhat reminiscent of DmC Devil May Cry having two dodges, which was interesting in concept but in execution it was needlessly complicated and one of them was objectively better.

This is clearly a new developer and they're getting the ropes, so I won't admonish these issues. Especially since what /is/ here is interesting, even in the current state. There is some level of it being a rather typical anime arpg, very reminiscent of the Tales series, but I think this game has a lot of potential to put its own twist on the genre as a lot more action focused.

Also, it's free, it's not like they're ripping people off for an underbaked game. 

I really, really want to see this game polished up and finished, and then see what the full version brings.

This section is for the devs, this is a list of the things I noticed in my brief play of the game that need to be addressed organized neatly for you to have as helpful feedback:

- Constrain mouse to window.

- Hide cursor during gameplay.

- The UI for the controls menu is on top of the actual keybind menu, making them overlap and making it difficult to read some things.

- I would map the escape key to be how you open the menu personally, or at least make it the pause key, since P is fairly unintuitive.

- Some audio doesn't seem to be properly linked to its slider, such as the sound when you complete an objective which blew my ears out despite me having everything turned way down, no slider seems to change it, either. Many combat sound effects and victory noises and such fall into this category.

- Mouse doesn't work with some of the menu, forcing you to use arrow keys to change categories and such.


I know some of that is KB+M specific and this game is largely designed controller first, but the cursor issue at least needs to be addressed since it means KB+M players in windowed mode or with multi-monitor setups just cannot play this game at all, which is unfortunate.

I hope to see this game polished up and see what comes of it!",1

- The audio cannot be muted or lowered for some sounds. there are SEVERAL sounds that are just really loud.

- I cheesed all my battles by turbo spamming right click and doing the despair flash ability to kill everything instantly. that is AFTER being stun locked multiple times and dying in one hit to some random ability

- I don't think the EP meter updates visually? I can do skills when its empty

- I got stuck in the results screen and I could turn in it?? 

- I got stun locked and died in a battle with a bunch of slimes after getting knocked down once..

- I came across some random sword at lv 5 and it teleported me to a VERY hard boss battle that one hits me. Why is that enemy there? Theres nothing harder than a level 5 slime around me at all times...

- I died DURING the beginning combat cutscene with that water jelly lady, It switched me to the jelly dude and he just got blown up immediately. 

- There is no autosave in the game. There needs to be one if you are just randomly throwing the player into a battle they are not prepared for.

- The game's help shows something about an adjustable difficulty setting but its simply just ""not available"" in the menu

The platforms, while erratic and seemingly random, are chosen with care, from a sword resembling the goddess sword and energy sword, gems resembling the chaos emeralds, a donut you can jump through above a nuclear power plant, it was all put together with care, if not for the player. There are plenty of atmospheric effects, like wind, the skybox changing based on your height, lots of little attention to detail things. It's charming, and fun if you have an unnecessary amount of compulsion to play every car platformer on offer and can handle some frustrating falls.",1
26632,"Pretty fun, got alot of obstacles that make you think differents ways to do the jumps, got few problems with the camera but if you enjoy the platform and hill games, give this one a chance.",1
26633,"Get it if you‚Äôre a fan of the genre, but others need to stay away.

You don‚Äôt need to look twice at the images to realize the game falls into the rage platformer genre. The goal of these games is to climb up by jumping on random objects floating in the air. There are no save spots or checkpoints, and if you drop over the edge, you will fall all the way down. 

Since it‚Äôs losing popularity because they all look the same, developers try new ways to stand out. One of them is to replace the human characters with all kinds of other, more ridiculous options.

This game decided to use karts and bikes. Both have a variety of skins, but the impact is solely visual. However, because there are just two wheels instead of four, the bike feels a little simpler to handle on narrow platforms. Controls are standard for a driving game, which means platforming is complicated.

You have the following controls: throttle, brake, jump, and turbo. Because you can't easily turn your vehicle the way you can turn human characters, you'll have to tread carefully while using reverse and forward. Physics engine is generous so you won‚Äôt fall down because of a tiny bump. 

The low-poly graphics are pretty nice and objects don‚Äôt stand out due to different art style. The bad part is the camera. While the camera may be rotated around the car, it cannot be turned down or up. This makes it impossible to see where you‚Äôre going. Most of the time, you're forced to jump blindly and hope for the best.  

You‚Äôll either give it a go for five minutes or play it for hours until you get to the top.",1

26639,"Si te gustan los arcades de ninjas, llenos de dobles saltos con tirabuz√≥n y ca√≠da en pinchos mortales, te gustar√° Stealth Blade
El en√©simo juego de ninjas de car√°cter indie llega a PC de mano de lc85, un estudio que cuenta en su haber tan s√≥lo este Stealth Blade y Endless Fireworks Simulator. Viendo la produccion de este estudio nobel y su distribuidora, 66games, se puede adivinar que se dedican a hacer peque√±os pero divertidos juegos destinados a m√≥vil y Steam. En este caso no podemos esperar mucho m√°s.

Stealth Blade Gameplay Primeros Niveles
Simple y divertido
Stealth Blade, o como se empe√±a en llamarle el men√∫ de Steam: La Cuchilla Sigilosa, est√° disponible por menos de cuatro euros y ofrece una diversi√≥n llena de acci√≥n y peligros acorde al tama√±o de su oferta. Es un t√≠tulo de factura r√°pida que nos pone a los mandos de un √°gil ninja que debe recorrer un escenario tras otro.

Cada nivel va a√±adiendo nuevas trampas y tipos de enemigos que alteran en mayor o menor medida la acci√≥n. La dificultad va aumentando a medida que completamos niveles, pero las habilidades ninja del protagonista son siempre las mismas, lo que hace que tengamos que ser cada vez m√°s diestros con el mando.

Tiene un estilo gr√°fico y unas animaciones basados en siluetas hechas con vectores que imita al teatro de marionetas y sombras tradicional de China. Te traslada directamente a los bosques de Bamb√∫ tan t√≠picos dentro de las historias de ninjas. La parte negativa de este aspecto visual es que hay veces que no se distingue el objeto que te puede matar con un simple roce, lo que en un juego tan din√°mico acarrea muchas muertes que se sienten injustas.


Poco m√°s
Stealth Blade es el mismo juego de un ninja esquivando trampas mortales y deshaci√©ndose de sus enemigos a katanazo limpio que hemos visto en muchas ocasiones. Su precio es reducido, as√≠ como sus valores de producci√≥n. Entretiene unas horas con una jugabilidad y unos gr√°ficos aceptables. Est√° disponible en Steam desde el 19 de diciembre de 2023 y ha salido directamente con precio reducido. Poco m√°s que decir.

Te gustar√° Stealth Blade si:

Te gustan los arcades cl√°sicos de ninjas.
Te sobran cuatro euros.
No te gustar√° si:

Buscas algo m√°s que saltar y matar en un juego.",1

I wasn't personally a fan of having to total the cost of all the items and looking back and forth constantly. The graphics are very pleasing, but doesn't quite make up for the lack of content overall. 

It would be interesting to have more work to do within the store as if you were the owner, like hiring employees, or even things like cleaning up if the floors were to get dirty. Small tasks like that would make it feel like draggy as you wait for customers to spawn and walk in.

I wouldn't buy it as is, but if they decided to add more features in the future, I think the game could have a lot of potential to be a really fun simulator game!",0
26642,"No, the screenshots of that game aren't from early development. That is the entire game. For $7 (on sale) this is possibly the worst paid game I have ever seen. 
You can see NPCs spawning and despawning from the shop window, and the stance they take and the way they walk shows they are either having a spasm attack, or as possessed by the devil.  
There is next to nothing to do, and each day is exactly the same, with the 'upgrades' actually making you earn less money and only filling the pathetic empty space. Some 'upgrades' don't do anything whatsoever.

26643,"Do you like watching youtube videos, but wish there was something that made you do simple mathematics every few minutes while staring at the latest cat videos?

Then look no further, as Cashier Simulator is the answer you're looking for!

Harnessing the incredible power of the Unreal Game engine, you are thrown into the dystopian nightmare of the retail industry in a world where a grocery store employee is, somehow, able to afford living on their own in an apartment without having 2 side hustles, and an and etsy shop selling homemade jewelry as you desperately try to fight off the disaster of the current global economy, and its treatment of the ""unskilled labor force"".

Is the game a job/career simulator? Not really. It is a resource management game? No (you *DO* have to stock the shelves, but that's just a simple task of walking to a shelf, pressing a single key, and the items are automatically placed perfectly). Is it a finance/investment simulator? Nope. The store will make $1 profit for every item sold as long as you add up the cost of the items correctly. The store doesn't have any expenses (so no electric bill, taxes, salary... anything...)

But oddly, if your looking for something to do while watching the best of twitch streams of games you enjoy playing... this is the answer you're looking for.

Lots of room for improvement... sadly, at this price point, I doubt we'll see any of them being implemented.",1

As you progress through the game, you can add more and more stock items for your customers to purchase. You can also add upgrade items such as a TV, which is a great feature that allows you to watch online videos or browse websites while playing the game. However, I do not recommend the chair upgrade as it gets in the way.

In my opinion, this game delivers exactly what it promises in the game description left by the developers on the product page on Steam. There are plenty of opportunities for future updates as well.

26656,"This was a decent horror game that wasn't that scary and was interesting game on finding your girlfriend who was kidnapped by the grim reaper. There isn't anything too crazy though when it comes to details and it is a simplistic horror game such as scripted chases by the main antagonist and collecting things to progress. 

Other than that it was ok and I beat it in an under an hour

26657,"Cool indie horror game that can be finished in an hour.

The plot revolves around a man who receives an e-mail from a girl who was allegedly kidnapped. The communication includes certain coordinates and a codeword, leading you to believe it is serious. 

Although you reach the location by boat, the game doesn‚Äôt take place on an island or some remote place. If you glance at your map, which is always available and displays your current location as well as the next objective, you will notice that you came across a lake. Furthermore, the playing area is restricted by a short fence that might have been easily jumped over. But you quickly forget about that because the game manages to pull you in.

Controls are standard for a walking sim. You can only walk, run, jump, and interact with things. Since the map allows some freedom, there is a good chance you will miss certain interactions. Most provide only a short description, so you won‚Äôt miss much. There are also notes to read and jumpscares or visions. 

Occasionally, you will also encounter the game‚Äôs antagonist. He usually just shows up to scare you, but some scripted events force you to run away from him. These are rare and don‚Äôt ruin the game. Saving is automatic, so you won‚Äôt lose progress even if you fail.

Now, the game isn‚Äôt open in a way that you can explore the entire map right from the start. There are gates that prevent progress until you do what needs to be done in a certain area. Luckily, a visual hint points to important objectives. A few logic puzzles are easy and items are used automatically. If you want a more immersive experience, you can download a mod from the developer‚Äôs site that removes tips. 

The text is fine and doesn‚Äôt have any awkwardness. The only issue is the voice feature. It uses AI instead of real people, so everything sounds really weird.",1

While its not a super scary horror game, it reminded me of the funny and stupid Amnesia custom stories I used to play.

If you never played Amnesia The Dark Descent, or some of its goofy custom stories, then this is probably not for you.

I still recommend this on a sale, its really not worth full price.

26661,"[h1]Graphics aren't bad, but that's it.[/h1]

I was ready to praise this as a cute first attempt at a ""game"".  It has graphics and controls, and you can click on things.  Then I realized that this is (at least) the 10th game this guy has made in the past 5 years.  In that light, it's inexcusable for this to be so random and meaningless.

In this ""game"", you wander around and look for things to click on.  Then those things disappear and you wander around looking for other things.  When you click on those, they disappear too.  You will (temporarily) befriend such allies as an exploding pig, a flying suitcase, and a talking mushroom.  Eventually you will save your girlfriend and live happily ever after, or maybe not.

I don't want my $1.59 back because the guy made an effort and this is a smooth running and bug free experience, but it's neither a good game nor a good story, and I wish I hadn't wasted my time on it.

26670,"Good, not great. Worth the price.
The game holds potential but overall it's in my oppinion still a work-in-progress... at least it should be. Since the steam page mentions nothing about early access, I would not hold my breath for major improvements though.

Liquid Space is heavily inspired by Star Fox (in my opinion mostly Star Fox 64). Instead of being a one to one recreation of those games and their mechanics it adds neat elements on top. Weapon charging is a major factor in how you play Liquid Space. Next to your basic blaster you are given three different charge shots. A precise and penetrating long distance rifle shot, a spread out short distance shotgun burst shot and a 4x missile lock-on. It is relatively easy to spontaneously swap between them and utilise each for different situations. The shotgun burst is good for downing small enemy groups that are about to fly past you, focusing on this weapon leads to quick and hectic flying action that feels very satisfying in seeing dozens of enemies being wiped out in short succession. The rifle shot is great for sniping big and bulky units from far away and occasionally comes in handy to destroy barriers. It is slower to use but ends up being a great mixup that offers a short breather from the else often chaotic flying. I used the missiles less often, but they kinda bridge the two other charge shots. It takes a bit to get them prepared so they are not super fast paced, but they act as a diverse tool that can be effective against more spread out enemy groups than the relatively compact burst shot. Combined with a very agile ship that has the option to drift - basically instantly turn around in 360¬∞ combat or shift from one end of the screen to the other in on-rails mode - this game can be super fun to get good at.

All in all the core concept is good, but the execution has issues. The first thing I have to mentions is the feedback. Coming from Star Fox 1 or 64 or Zero I am spoiled by games that have very clear and crisp feedback on what's going on. Being shot at, being hit, locking on to enemies, hitting them, hitting ground, how far away you are from obstacles, which mode you are in, how fast you are flying. Liquid Space to me often felt very muted, as if I was playing with shades, mufflers and gloves. Music was blaring and stuff happened, but I did not feel connected to it. I regret not being able to phrase this better, but this is the part where I feel like this is early access. It's missing the juice!

Other than that I feel like the levels are very hit and miss. The tutorial and first levels are very easy, bordering on bland. I would suggest to stick with it until you reach the green acid planet, here I felt like the game gets it right. Exciting level design and a good challenge. The following level ramps it up a bit and has a few tough spots that in my opinion demand a bit too much from players who were not really forced or incentivized to engage with the drift mechanic up until that point. This culminates in a boss fight that got too frustrating for me and ended my first session there.

Overall if the bulk of the game felt as engaging as these two later stages, I might be looking forward to starting this game up again. It is afterall a score hunter. But as it stands I'm not terribly excited to try those early stages again.

Still, I draw a positive conclusion. Not the least because I am very interested in the Star Fox fan scene and most competitors get not just the juice and level design wrong but often even the basics like aiming, shooting and flying. In that regard Liquid Space is very competent and deserving of attention.",1
26671,"Liquid Space is an absolute marvel, leaving me utterly blown away by its narrative prowess. Without delving into specifics, the storyline unfolds like a celestial ballet, weaving an intricate tapestry of mystery and intrigue that had me on the edge of my seat throughout.

The emotional resonance of the characters and the enigmatic universe they inhabit left me captivated, yearning for more with each passing revelation.

There is some replay value if one really likes to replay levels to get a higher score and grade.",1
26675,"Disclaimer: I recieved a copy of Liquid Space Dimension for free through my Steam Curator page.

Liquid Space is a low-poly space shooter with both on-rails and free-flight sequences that take a lot of cues from the SNES and N64-era Starfox games. It has colorful visuals and an interesting soundtrack, and the controls are mostly competent. It is however noticibly faster then Starfox, which creates some issues with the gameplay.

In addition, the game's difficulty curve is a 90 degree upwards right angle. The first five or so levels are very easy as compared to the game's inspirations, but my progress came to a screeching halt at the boss called the ""Supreme Inhibitor"", who throws a lot of geometric bullshit at you and is only vulnerable to damage for a few seconds after destroying small crystals that are blocked by said bullshit, which will also quickly shave off your health.

Overall the game feels a bit amateurish. If they give it a serious difficulty rebalance I'd be willing to give it another chance, but for now if you are looking for this kind of experience, EX-Zodiac might be more to your liking.",0
26676,"Arcade with cool music and colorful stages that don‚Äôt last long.

The game is quite retro. You play Sid, a space warrior who is fighting alone against the space tyrant. During what is supposed to be the final battle, Sid finds that the tyrant is virtually unbeatable and possesses enormous abilities capable of opening portals to other dimensions. When Sid is dragged through one and lands in an unknown world, he is greeted by a god who provides him with a new weapon to aid him in his struggle. 

The story is barebones. The prologue, which also serves as a tutorial, is where you‚Äôll get most of what you need to know. The main mode is actually pure arcade where you have a limited number of lives to get through seven stages in a linear order. There are only few bits of story in those stages and in the ending.

You take control of a fighter called Space Drifter. It plays like a standard action game. You can fly around, fire the main laser, and do a couple of acrobatic moves. The fighter will fire a burst when the laser button is held down for a second or two. The downside is that burst has a very short range. 

The other move is simply space drifting. It‚Äôs not as exciting as it sounds because it‚Äôs just a fancy mechanic to let you make faster turns. However, it also allows you to turn back, hover on the spot and take out enemies behind you. 

More advanced moves will have to be mastered in order to play the game efficiently. The roll is great while flying through narrow spaces, and it can advance into a barrel roll when you press the roll button twice. This is a crucial move because it is linked to two special weapons.

When you charge the laser and perform a barrel roll, you will either activate a precision laser beam that goes far and kills most targets with a single shot, or a swarm of torpedoes that will fly towards marked targets. The fire mode is determined by the barrel roll direction and fires only when you release the fire button.

A stage is typically divided into two sections. One is comparable to a rail shooter in that you fly forward on a predetermined course. You can still perform all of the movements, but you can't turn back. The second section is a free flight zone or an arena where you must complete a predetermined objective, such as destroy 10 enemy fighters. You can fly however you want in this zone, but you can‚Äôt leave the area.

The game is quite short. Although each stage is unique and features low-poly graphics that add a certain charm, they don't stay long. It's also very simple because there are no prerequisites to meet in order to pass a stage. There is a score system, but it is optional. Points are earned by collecting gold icons and destroying enemies, and it drops to zero when you are hit.

There are no extras unlocked after beating the game and no achievements.",1

While I do wish that more art was included (like more ingame art, maybe some more concepts), it gives some very interesting insights into how the art for the game was created, like for example showing off the 3D environments that were used for the background art. My only gripe would be that it isn't translated, but I can forgive that. I think the art speaks for itself on all accounts.",1

Pros:
- Combines a bit of all the different indie horror games you see out now
- Runs really smooth and shows understanding of how to use assets well
- The portal aspect worked so well

Cons:
- Some parts of the game the puzzle hints don't read as they should
- Some puzzles are very just brute force style which I don't love
- I felt like some of the actions were poorly executed, I know I'm not the only one who had issues with the crawl v croush vent fiasco.

26723,"I do really enjoy the game, and managed to completed the part.1
Maybe you can add subtitles for the radio and the tape so we can hear and understand clearly what they said, because the voice is kinda muffled(for me who's note an english native speaker).
And maybe add a brightness setting, because the game is wayyyy to dark.
I do enjoy the different kind of puzzle in this game that not monotone.
And the tips text on the start maybe you can make it like a pop out at the first of the game, cause when it's a running text on the loading screen it kinda a little bit fast to read.
And I don't even know that I can jump at the start of the game, which make me stuck on the 1st stage on the game kinda long.
And I really love the sound effect of this game, it really do give me the creep.

The Dev do a really good job in making this game. Especially when I compare the current gameplay with the early gameplay from other people the dev already fix a lot of bug that mentioned on other review.

Will play this game again for the part 2.

Saves don't even save properly, you get stuck in the locker sometimes. if you reload a save you just load in the same locker you were stuck in before for some reason. lots of stolen assets that don't belong to you being used and i really feel like it's not legally alright to be selling a game that uses assets that you ripped from places like cod zombies or a model marketplace. there are useless items like oil you find in the beginning but no lantern, you find batteries later on that don't lead to anything. i had to quit because teleporting was spawning me outside the map with items i had 10 playthroughs ago because the game can't even register what save file to pull data from and it all gets corrupted. it took my 3rd playthrough for me to finally be able to even take the VHS tape out the box by the tv. the controls swap up once you get past the chase sequence from a fixed camera to a floating camera and you lose all your previous loot you found. the boss fight was fun but after that you get to a hallway with a locked door that needs a keycode and i spawned with 100 rounds of 9mm but no gun so i couldn't get passed the zombie blocking the hall until i looped her and hopped on the table with the box which i opened but there was nothing inside it! the game feels like it was made by multiple people who weren't working together and did their own thing and kinda mashed it all into one game. I cannot recommend this game as i slowly started hating playing it because of how unplayable the game had become.",0
26727,"Great mechanics, the start was actually better than expected. Unfortunately once the locker mechanics appeared (which I consider great and different than usual) bugs over bugs started to appear making the game unplayable. It's useless to try making the game longer by adding a chase especially if you know that you're not able to make it correctly without wrong hitboxes. Lockers were accessible at all times and I couldn't even watch the tape since I firstly tried to enter the locker not knowing what it does, I simply thought I could be hiding in there.

26732,"In my opinion, this is a very boring janky low-budget third person indie shooter that should actually be free. Charging money for such crap is just wrong. To begin with, this game is poorly optimized with constant frame rate drops and there is only one graphic setting of low or high. You also cannot remap the controls, the fov is low and cannot be adjusted, there are no footstep sounds, shooting guns feels weak, and getting too close to some walls obstructs your view by placing your view behind these walls. The environment is also excessively dark and there is no gamma or brightness option. You can only see what's inside the small circle of light from the flashlight, which you constantly have to keep turning back on. The environments are also typical spaceship dark corridors that seem like a confusing maze that you aimlessly wonder through. There is also no single player campaign. You just go on roguelike runs in the same dull areas to collect resources. Zombies also constantly rush and corner you to where the mission ends in failure and you must then start that mission completely over. If this game was free then perhaps I could see some value as a time waster because that's precisely what this game is in my opinion... a waste of time.",0
26733,"Quite a curious game to speak on. There isn't much of a story here. You get to play as one of several operatives as ya attempt to complete objectives within deployments. The shoot-y bits could be better. The shotgun would sometimes miss even when the enemy is right in ur face lol, for example.  I had a decent time while in a mission but I didn't like the fact that i had to fight with the flashlight. The battery for it is not that great..drains too quick. I also don't like that it is attached to ur weapons and and it is a problem coz they contain a lot of sway. So the light will be all over the place as a result. Overall, not a bad game but one with a few flaws.

it looks good but it has that feel to it like you're playing a game from the year 2000 even i remember games with less rendering in the 2000.

26736,"It's alright, but it bothers me how neglected the guy's story is in comparison to the girls. His story is just as serious and impactful as hers, but is left with only 1 third of the length. The girl's story is full of details that just aren't present in the guy's story, which makes it strongly reek of bias and seems like the developer views women's issues as more severe than men. Maybe I'm taking it the wrong way, but it seriously sat wrong with me.",0
26737,"[i]Alex's Hope & Alex's Solitude[/i] is a dramatic, emotional kinetic visual novel developed and published by Violet Horizons Productions.  It narrates two different stories, both of which have the main character, Alex.  However, one Alex is male while the other Alex is female.  In the first story, [i]Alex's Hope[/i], a boy named Alex is living in bleak conditions, trying his best to attend school while working a part-time job.  However, his mother abuses him to the point of stealing his hard-earned money, so that it would make escaping that situation extremely difficult.  Alex is in so much despair that he feels like it would be best to [spoiler]end his life[/spoiler], but then a chance encounter with a cute animal changes it all.  In the other story, [i]Alex's Solitude[/i], a girl named Alex is feeling scared of attending her first day in high school.  Alex ended up spending a lonely summer, being isolated by her middle school friends, because [spoiler]Alex learned that one of her friends, Briane, brought alcohol and decided to report it to a teacher[/spoiler].  Despite that high school should have been a fresh start for Alex, the consequences of the incident I just mentioned follow Alex to the point where [spoiler]Briane spreads ugly rumors about Alex to make sure that no one would befriend her[/spoiler].  This hurts Alex to the point where she finds herself becoming friends with an upperclassman who is more on the wild side, and fascinated, Alex decides to find out what it's like.  Since both stories are linear, I'll stop here to avoid spoilers. ^^

In regards to the gameplay, both stories are linear, so you just play through the stories from beginning to end since there are no choices.  When you're in the main menu, you can choose which story to read.  A few CGs are shown although there is no CG gallery in which you can view them.  There are a few tracks present as well but no voice acting.  Also, a few Steam achievements are present although they won't count towards a user's global total until the game is out of ""Steam is learning about this game"".

Now that I've gone over the story and gameplay, I'll move onto my thoughts.  It has been quite a while since I last played a free-to-play game, so I thought it'd be a good time to highlight one that caught my interest.  With that said, I'll first talk about the stories.  I enjoyed reading both stories.  Although they both touch on dark topics like [spoiler]depression, suicide, bullying, etc.[/spoiler], I like when games focus on these topics rather than just ignore them, as though they don't exist.  Out of the two stories, I must say that [i]Alex's Solitude[/i] feels more fleshed out.  Even though I enjoyed [i]Alex's Hope[/i], especially because that hope comes in the form of a [spoiler]sweet, adorable cat[/spoiler], I felt that [i]Alex's Solitude[/i] had more story depth.  In [i]Alex's Solitude[/i], I could feel both sympathy and empathy for Alex.  On a personal note, I know what it feels like to be isolated, all just because you take a stand and make the right choice, even though others cannot clearly understand that.  The story definitely has its dark, depressing moments when Alex decides to [spoiler]go on the dangerous side.  Fortunately, Alex learns from her experiences and knows who she is as a person, even if it goes against peer pressure and whatnot[/spoiler].  Despite the topics that are addressed, both stories have hopeful endings.

As for the writing, the pacing is fine.  Both stories are short, but for a free-to-play game, I feel like this is fine, especially if you're looking for a quick read.  I didn't notice any typos or whatnot, so major kudos to the editor/proofreader. ^^  All the achievements unlocked for me as well.

In regards to the art, it is beautiful.  Both the sprites and backgrounds are drawn and colored very well.  The use of colors feels right, never being overly bright.  Especially, the CGs are done well.  I just wish that there was a CG gallery where I can view them, especially the CG of the cat. ^^  With the music, there are a few tracks and they fit well in the scenes they are placed in.  They give off an emotional feel, which is perfect since both stories are dramatic and emotionally driven.

Overall, would I recommend [i]Alex's Hope & Alex's Solitude[/i]?  If you're looking for a couple of short stories to pass a bit of time and don't mind dark, depressing topics, then I think this is worth checking out.  It's free-to-play, so really, there's no reason not to give it a try.  I enjoyed reading both stories, especially [i]Alex's Solitude[/i], and I hope that the developer will continue to create more visual novels like this one and bring them to Steam. ^^

26739,"[h3]Alex's Hope & Alex's Solitude[/h3]

The game shows us the incredible life stories of a boy and a girl named Alex. The game shares the thoughts of the characters, allowing you to feel their experiences and understand what difficult period of life they are going through.

The first character, living his life in the endless routine of working and playing on the computer, has no friends, no girlfriend, and no interests in life in general. Spending his salary on not very useful hobbies, he sinks deeper and deeper into the abyss. And one day, seeing that his mother hid all the money out of harm‚Äôs way, he decides to put an end to it. You know, there‚Äôs a phrase, You truly realize what you‚Äôve done only when you‚Äôre already flying after jumping off a cliff. But nothing can be changed anymore. [spoiler][b]Hope[/b]fully, he has understood it before he jumped.[/spoiler]

The second character, a girl, lost all her friends after an unpleasant incident. Having the opportunity to start over from scratch at a new school, Alex decides not to be a bore and starts drinking and smoking in order to fit into the company of friends. But at one moment she realizes that this is not at all the life she wanted. And all these ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are actually dragging her down. Having come to her senses in time, she again distances herself from them, but this time she does not regret anything.

The visuals in the game are amazing. Every scene, every character is beautifully drawn. Such attention to detail makes you admire every frame.
The soundtrack is also excellent, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of what is happening and get into the reading experience.

I would like to praise the developers for creating a short but very strong game in which they showed quite serious problems of young people, to which many, almost everyone, turn a blind eye. Loneliness and misunderstandings from parents often lead to sadness, which turns into depression. And if you don‚Äôt support a person in time, what will happen will happen.

The game looks good, I'm always drawn to visual novels that move away from the default anime style. It's not voiced (to be expected) but the music is decent. It's well written but the stories just aren't very interesting to me. I might have been slightly more interested if I was younger. I'm 36 now and as a teenager I could have definitely related to the story. But honestly, there are so many games that are so very similar to this. I've already played a bunch of them recently.

I wish both games could have gone more in depth, so I'm looking forward to the sequel.

I can recommend the game...
But yeah, the guy's story is kind of neglected compared to the girl's.
Awfully so. And tbh, i prefer the guy's. Shorter but better. Plus, there's a cat in it.
The girl's at points felt artificial yet powerful as well.
Both stories remind me of certain past and current aspects of my life. A lot. And, yeah. I'm an Alex too.

The background art is pretty good. The character's art too, but I'm not sure if it's too compatible with the backgrounds. The OST is okay-ish. 
Overall, I'm pretty sure your next game's going to be awesome. Keep it up.

26762,"Overall the game is alright but it basically plays out the same as the first but a few areas are just copy pasted from the first game with different things happening except in the last level before the ending you basically do the same thing as in the first game with a different girl walking around. I'll do a list of some of the negatives I found while playing the game to make things easy

The trailers for the game and the intro cinematic are deceptive because I thought there were going to be 3 demon ladies idk what to call them lol but we only got one. Even thought that maybe there would be more to the house plus  the other demon lady like in the one trailer but it doesn't exist  the only purpose of the house is to make you run and fetch things before you pass out and end up in the one area

the voice actor stops talking after getting out of the truck and never talks again then somehow nearly crashes off the cliff into the house after the fade to black with the game logo and when the game fades in again its like that? and he never mentions what happened?

The house can be confusing since you have to find small fuses with nothing telling where they are such as maybe a sparkle effect 

Objects in the game clipping through other objects and I even noticed that a bathroom had no stalls will floating door handles

The copy pasted levels such as the beginning were fine but it would of been nice to to have something different later on since we are doing the same thing as in the first game on the last level of this game

Back to the trailers I thought there would be an animation for when the 1 girl gets you but there really isn't my guy just falls down like a stone sideways after getting sliced by her knife. the trailers had more animations then the actual game

the last level is horribly glitchy (see my video at the bottom) and confusing the book puzzle where you turn three markings doesn't make sense and the hint for the safe does not work at all idk what the code is.

the last level just does a repeat of chores from the first game and plays out the same (if it worked and wasn't so glitchy lol)

I unintentionally found a bug to skip the entire last level where if you have the girl chase you she would trigger doors to open so what I did was go to the last room (when you go up the stairs and make a right) waited for the checkpoint save to show up have her kill me then when I respawned I took the saw opened the closet and beat the game. This was the worst level cause it is impossible to beat with how it is as I mentioned before and I would of given up had I not found the glitch.

This game could of been good if it was like how it is the trailers with the 3 monsters instead of 1, better animations, less copy paste from the first game, and more easy to understand puzzles, along with the other things I mentioned before but with how the trailers are for the game it seems deceptive cause I thought it would be a bit different from the first game but plays out the same as the first game

26766,No... just no. I gave this game not one... not two... but three different chances. Things weren't loading. Things needed to progress in the game just wouldn't show up in the environment.

26770,"Unlike many of the indie horror games on Steam this is quite polished and unique. The story is interesting and the gameplay is pretty fun. The vibe is very similar to RE7, with the creepy house and ghost girl. There's a few little issues here and there; some of the codes and objects can be tricky to find and there's some small environment clipping. Overall though, it's a well made game and if you're looking for something unique I would definitely recommend it.",1
26771,"Very buggy and confusing, but still an enjoyable experience.

I had a good enough time playing it and have been watching the progress on the HFPS and UHFPS Discord server. I also played the Demo when it was released back in early November. I really enjoyed the visual style and some of the unique features I saw, including things like squeezing through objects and pushing them aside.

However, there were also a LOT of issues I found. Most of the safe-related puzzles are not really solvable. There isn't enough given to the player for them to be able to figure it out. I had to rely on an old message in the discord server in order to solve the first safe puzzle with the ghost girl, and then used a video walk through for EVERY other safe puzzle. The final one, with the 2 optional codes (I think) actually require BOTH codes to be input at the same time.

Also, I was able to sequence break a few times, and also got the AI stuck twice. Along with this, some items such as the one that gives boosted stats doesn't work completely. I don't get any bonus health from it.

And finally, a lot of the hints that the player gets (like interacting with items) are given to the player AFTER they have already done it before. You get a prompt telling you that glowing items are interactable ones AFTER you already pick up the key outside and enter the house. It was super confusing for me.

If you wish to view any of the issues I've seen, I have 2 streams and an upcoming video which will include most of the issues I encountered: https://www.youtube.com/@Decager

And if this game DOES receive the necessary updates to where it is stable, I will gladly change my review.",0

26781,"[b] TL:DR- This game is if Footsies had different characters. With a quick game-play loop ""hopping on for a few matches"" will quickly turn into 50+. Buy the game, get wrecked online then start teaching people how to air parry your tech traps. [/b]

For a 2-button fighting game, Dojo Masters radiates mechanical depth and nuance that some modern fighting games fail to capture or obfuscates behind ""system mechanics"". Each ""Character"" contain so much identity that you quickly forget they are effectively an avatar for the fighting style. The beautiful pixel art and unique move set ensures no two characters play the same and yet they never feel like they are breaking the rules. From Boxer with their Roman Cancel like Spin Dash to Taekwondo's feints and movement it feels amazing both learning a single character as well as trying out the cast. 

Winning a match is simple. Get your opponents health low and knock them down. But once you add tech recovery and parry to the mix it quickly becomes a game of high speed hard reads. Even if you only want to play casually there is still ample enjoyment beating on your opponent. Dojo Masters's fluid animations and responsive controls just feels good to play.

While I can't say the game is without it's cons, my complains are relatively minor. Due to the retro aesthetic, the location and description of some menu options are not immediately clear. In addition the input buffer is pretty lenient which is generally great but not my personal preference. 

If this style of game is not for you, It's well worth giving a shot. Even if you don't love it, I'm sure you will like it!",1
26782,"Excellent combat and fun online play so far. I enjoy all the characters, specifically the boxer and Muay Thai fighter the most. Would love to see more styles of fighters in the future!",1
26783,"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THISüíØ Moves are accurate to each martial art, movement is seamless, easy to pick up but this will not hold your hand.

26784,"[h1]Amazingly well made fighting game. Strictly the basics.[/h1]

Way better that SF6 and SF5 combine. You can definitely get your old school fighting game fix with this title. 
Hope for more characters and stages in future.
Awesome Game! Thumbs Up!",1
26785,"Initially, i thought meh. But after playing some more I realised its a really fun, raw n unique fighting experience that satisfies the feel of more realistic fighting. It feels much more visceral than most AAA top graphic fighters, and the martial arts feel ace and very well represented.  Highly recommended. Dont let the pixel graphics sway your assumption of it..

I can't find anyone online to play yet.",1
26786,"A fantastic game that immediately takes me back to the days of International Karate.

26787,I'm pretty bad at fighting games the only one I was able to get okay at before this game was Smash bros. This game is very simple to get into and short matches with its game loop is very addictive you can easily rank up to 50 matches. If your looking for a fighting game that is actually easy to get into and hard to master and your into all the different types of fighting styles then get this game. BTW lets goooo boxer all the way,1
26788,Easy to play but hard to master. With only two attack buttons this game can create some of the hypest moments I've had in a fighting game in a while. If you like fighting games this is easily worth picking up.,1
26789,"Dojo Masters is sort of like a modernized Karate Champ, but there are several different martial arts represented as their own characters. There are only 2 attack buttons, but some techniques require really tight timing windows to pull off, so it's not really an ""easy execution"" game. To win you have to deplete the opponent's stamina, then get an un-teched knockdown.

The online play and matchmaking/rematching flow is smooth and there are good, detailed tutorials on the game and each character. There isn't much to do single player as the arcade/survival options are pretty bare bones, but the dev has been working hard to update and improve the game in even just the short window since launch. So I think it will improve with time.",1
26790,"holy shit this game is so fun
please get this game so the wait times for online are a little shorted (also it's WELL worth the money. i see myself playing this game far into the future and mastering every character).

26791,"Dojo Masters is pretty light on content at the moment, but it's cheap and takes up very little hard drive space so it's easy to look past that and enjoy a solid fighting game.

It only uses two buttons (three if you use the dash button,) there's no supers, there's no anti-air because there's no jumping, and there's no okizeme because there aren't even any health bars (you win when you knock your opponent to the ground.) As such, it's the rare fighting game that can be easily picked up and enjoyed by people with no experience in the genre, or possibly video games in general. Despite being so simple, it's not shallow or boring because the mechanics are refined to emphasize skill and concentration. You won't win by mashing your two buttons.",1
26792,"Easy to get into, but requires a bit more effort to master which is a good thing in my opinion. All styles has depth to them and the matches can get fun from the intensity. I'm really vibing with the kendo and taekwondo styles so far",1
26793,"o jogo segue a proposta de ser r√°pido.
√â legal, e requer um certo n√≠vel de habilidade pra ser bom nele, mas eu senti que ficou minimalista demais.

(UPDATE VVV)
 
O jogo tamb√©m te ensina combos e todos os movimentos de todas as classes no dojo, √© bem simples, mas d√° pra fazer muita coisa com isso e o gameplay fica muito melhor quando voc√™ domina o personagem. acabei de ganhar de 30 a 5 em uma partida online. Os rounds s√£o curtos e as partidas s√£o muito mais divertidas depois de pegar o jeito.

(ENGLISH)

The game fulfils its promise of being a pick up n play fighting game.
its nice, and requires a certain lvl of skill to get good at it, however, I felt its overly simplicity to be flawed.

(UPDATE VVV)

The game also teacher you every movemente with every class in the dojo, its quite simple, but with those tools you can do pretty much, and the gameplay gets so much better once you realize what ur doing. I just won a online match agains a guy, by 30-5. The rounds are short and the matches are much more fun once you get the feeling of the game",1
26794,"Easy to pick up and hard to master, Dojo Masters is a fun 2D fighting game, very much leaning more towards realism than your Street Fighters, but still very much in the video game-y territory of logic that it's in.

It takes the familiar concept of multiple fighters of differing martial art backgrounds (Street Fighter, Tekken, etc.), and paints it in a shade closer to real life combat sports, with knockdowns resetting the round and positions, and the ""health"" equivalent being basically stamina. Add to that the fact that you can tech knockdowns and parry with the right timing, alongside the simplified control scheme, and you have something very unique on your hands.

Looking forward to seeing where the game goes in the future!",1
26795,"This game is SICK, I love all the different playstyles, I love how every fighting style teaches you habits you can take to any other playstyle, like how muay thai focuses on footsies, and boxing focuses on rushing down, but learning them will help you with kendo (focused on zoning).
If you think martial arts are awesome and you like simple fighting games, this one has a lot to offer, and is definitely worth the price.",1
26796,"Edit: Have updated to positive just like I said I would 

Love the game. In fact I even made a post on Reddit recommending it to people to try and grow the community. With that said. I‚Äôm leaving a negative review so some issues can be see and addressed. Hopefully my promotion offsets any potential damage from this review. Either way I‚Äôll update it to positive in a few weeks

With everything these is to love, this game has some of the worst settings I‚Äôve ever used in the entire FGC. 

Remapping your controls for in battle also remaps your controls for menu navigation. So lets say you like your punches and kicks on your bumpers, well now you also have to use those as your ‚Äòaccept‚Äô and ‚Äòback buttons‚Äô

Also, why do I have to go all the way back to the main menu to change controls. Nothing like having 4 friends with 2 connected controllers and having to go back to the main menu after every single switch to fix peoples preferred buttons. 

Want your punch buttons above your kick buttons like pretty much every other fighting game ever? Well your going to have to use A for back and X for accept. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

The way the trials progress means that if you want to keep practicing what you‚Äôve been taught you end up missing critical information. There should also be indicators that the opponent is about to attack so you can properly learn the timing of parries and timed moves like perfect ducks. 

Finally, I wouldn‚Äôt mind an option to make grab two buttons, but that‚Äôs not a large deal. 

Still love the game and will be putting some time into getting good with friends. Just want these things to be noted as they do get in the way of the experience, especially for my more casual friends.",1
26797,"mix of footsies and 3rd strike, its the best game to play some rounds and have fun, able to lab your combos, find crazy mixups and even get crazy with the play modes, 100% recomended",1
26798,A hidden gem of a fighting game. The game is very easy to get the handle of but has many layers of mastery when you start going deeper into the mechanics. It's great fun to play with friends as regardless of your expertise in fighting games Dojo masters never makes you feel like you are ever being dominated or that you can't comeback. Even if you do lose a round the pain is brief before you can have another crack at winning once more. Highly recommend!,1
26799,"Great arcade fighter with fast pace combat with combos that keep the movement flowing. the interface is very easy to use and controls are simple as can be. Game play as stated in the trailer is easy to pick up but hard to master with movement mostly going to be A, S, D while the action buttons for P1 that I have use on boot up are K for punch, O for kick, P break grab. 

Tutorials are descriptive and even tell you how to preform true combos for those who know what they are, these are also in the trials sections which are a great way to learn each character. Online is quick to get and out of with a nice fist bump mechanic for when you or your opponent does something cool. One huge thing that they have added as well is couch co-op which is a dying thing to see, quite the welcome surprise to see in this game. 

One con is the steam workshop still needs a little work but the game is new.  

As a new game its fun and something anyone should pick up with a friend to play together in person or online.",1

26802,"[b]TLDR: Buy it.[/b]

Full review here --> https://pastebin.com/zQJzCAqU

[h1]GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW[/h1]
You have a stamina bar (represented by stocks of bamboo) at the bottom of the screen. Once they've depleted, you have to 'down' your opponent with a move that knocks down to win a game. There‚Äôs a variety of ways to knock your opponent down outside of just using a move with the knockdown property. Games can be over in a flash or take a while as both you and your opponent adjust to one another's fighting styles. Most games won‚Äôt take that long tho.

The controls are simple. No complex inputs whatsoever. You have Punch and Kick as your attack buttons, Left and Right for your movement buttons, and an optional Dash button. You cannot jump or crouch in the game which limits your movement to moving back and forth. This puts a TON of emphasis on spacing your moves properly. While the inputs and movement are simple, the gameplay still has depth and some moves in the game require STRICT timing, but are not required to have fun or play decently online. It‚Äôs easy to pick up and play, but there's a ton of room to grow if you want to learn.

[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]
The art style in the game is lowres and has really cool animations. When you hit an opponent, they shake around for a split second which makes hits feel powerful. The sfx are chunky and crunchy which fits the retro aesthetic. The music is a really good mix of drum and bass, hip-hop, and rock. The music is dynamic in some way, though I‚Äôm not sure how it works exactly. I believe it changes based on the timer, so as the timer ticks down the music gets more intense. The songs that are available are really nice and get you in the mood to fight.

There are SO many stages and the stages change if you go into overtime, making the matches feel extra tense. I cannot express to you how many cool stages there are in this game. Some are static, but some have moving parts, like the Bridge-2 stage that wiggles a little when you walk on certain parts of it, OR the Bridge-1 stage that has a wave crashing in the background when you land a parry. The Forest-1 stage has little lightning bugs flying around if you go into overtime and it‚Äôs beautiful. The polish on these stages make the game feel alive and super cool! I‚Äôd love more stages like this. I think most are static, but they‚Äôre still pleasing to look at.

Each character has two colors in their outfit that you can mix and match as you please before every match. There‚Äôs at least 20 colors you can unlock as you play the game and level up your account. There‚Äôs also 10 different skin tones that are available right away. There‚Äôs a shoe or no shoe option for characters depending on your tastes. Lastly, there‚Äôs only two hair styles, short and long. Each character has unique short and long styles of hair. For example, The Taekwondo character either has a double bun or a buzzcut, but on the Karate character you have the options of a ponytail or a bowl cut.  I kinda wish there were more options, but the styles we currently have are kinda great imo.

[h1]COMBAT[/h1]
The combat is simple in theory and in execution, but where it gets complex is the mind games. Since this entire game is basically neutral, you are constantly playing footsies with your opponent, dancing back and forth trying to get that one or two stray hits in. Every hit counts in this game. The mechanics feel well thought out. You can tech to save yourself, if you ever don‚Äôt know how to deal with a move you can parry, you can use quick jabs to knock opponents out of the air, etc. It seems like there‚Äôs an answer for nearly everything as long as you are willing to experiment.

[h1]ONLINE[/h1]
This game has rollback netcode and feels great for the most part. I'd like to see a signal strength filter implemented in the future.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
This is one of the most fun fighting games I‚Äôve ever played. I think that games like Fantasy Strike sacrificed a lot of longevity for their game in the name of simplicity, but I think Dojo Masters has struck a perfect balance. It‚Äôs beginner friendly and has depth. Each character allows for expression in playstyle while also having a distinct playstyle on their own. It‚Äôs clear to me that a lot of thought and love has been put into this game. It‚Äôs perfect for a party game or for hardcore sweats or for people who just wanna have a little game on the side away from their main title. I‚Äôve been having a blast playing it every day since it came out and I hope that the dev(s) continues to work on it because I think they made something special here.

For only $15, this game is a MUST BUY for those that are fans of the fighting game genre or for anyone looking to dip their toes in.
",1
26803,"I make gaming sessions with friends in my house once a month. We usually play some Retro games (I have quite a collection of consoles) and some common multiplayer games (stuff like Duck Game or Ultimate Chicken Horse)

Since I bought Dojo Masters, it quickly became a favourite. It's easy to pick up, controls are really simple, so anyone can quickly start playing it. The fights being so lightining quickcly are great for ""King of the Hill"" matches between a fair number of people.

As we keep playing it, you start picking up a winning strategy, which then someone will pick up and have a counter strategy, and then you will counter his counter... and I guess it's easy to understand how it goes.

The game also has a 4 player mode which is pretty fun because of the chaos ensued, but not as a strategic and deep as the normal 1x1 mode. Still a lot fun with friends, so a great addition to the game.

Single player modes are pretty meh, can't say anything about the online. But playing with friends is a blast, I recommend it a lot.",1
26804,"Picked up to play with my brother and so far had a great time. Animations are great and the option to taunt with the face-the-camera-turn is hilarious. Was fun to mash in to see interactions, but it seems like there's room to train/optimize for punishes and I'm eager to see how that will heighten the tension. Can't speak much to the matchmaking quality yet, but I'm eager to see what the modding support will provide (I think Your Only Move Is Hustle benefited from it greatly), so I think this one is an easy pick up.

Couple unstructured thoughts:
Boxer movement felt satisfying af
Krav Maga dashes + pressure were hilarious
TaeKwonDo axe kick is sick af
Kendo run feels good
Grab teching + floor teching feel like good spikes of excitement in a match once you get comfortable with the systems

26810,"This game is SO ass... 
Is what I would say if this game was actually ass.

P.S Nerf the Muay Thai Knee special, just lower the range and the game is perfect.",1
26811,"In short, Dojo Masters is an incredibly fun fighting game that's (as many have described it as) easy to learn, hard to master. Tbh, the only fighting game that I've played extensively is SSBU, so it took me a second to get used to how this game played in comparison to that, but once I got the hang of a couple martial arts the game really had me hooked. Each martial art is unique and focuses on different styles, techniques, and strategies. For only having two main buttons for attacking, this game has some great depth.
So far, everything feels pretty tight, but my main complaint isn't really about the game but rather the lack of players on it currently. Again, hopefully more people do see this game and get it so that wait times won't be too long. 

 If you do pick it up, consider leaving a review so that more are exposed to the game and also potentially pick it up as well. Hopefully later on we get more arts like wrestling or capoeira.",1

But that might be exactly what you need in your life.",1
26825,"I'm having a lot of fun with this game so far. Definitely it is a nice change of pace from most fighters. It is kind of like footsies but with different characters and a few more movement options (it is a good in between, not being too simple and not having too many mechanics). Parry ftw. Also the rollback netcode is good! The asking price of $15 is a bit much, especially since ranked mode is not out yet (says to come out in august). On sale for $12 I would recommend it, if the price drops to $10 it is definitely a buy for fighting game fans or martial arts fans.",1

Went back to see if I could do anything different this morning and idk how, game seems real linear. It's not that fun or scary either, you basically have the run of the place, then the game will give you like 15 second warning windows to go hide, which takes all the tension out after the 1st time when you realize ah the ai will know if you left a door open. then you just start closing drawers and stuff after you open them and it's boring with no threat.",0
26832,"I had fun with this game, but honestly after sittin' on it for a bit, it feels unfinished. 

There seems to be a lot of extra interactables, doors, locked-away items, and points of interest that strongly suggests a lot was cut from the final release. 

Considering the dev is the publisher, I can't imagine they were forced to hit a deadline, so I don't know what happened.

Don't get me wrong, what is here is complete, and works just fine, but given all the evidence... it really appears that the game was supposed to be much longer.

Game maybe takes about an hour to complete as is.

It's not a bad game, but I do wish it was longer. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the Granny series.",1
26833,"So, here we have a game! I mean at least it's definition is a game!
On the title bar you can only choose play or exit since the options bar is not working. There are non what so ever any kind of directions and within the time I've played it I couldn't understand what to do!
I guessed that it was a grinding game so I used macro mouse after a while but it still didn't change anything!
You give the bird some kind of money and it gives you a gift with no definition and no hint how or where to use it. 
The ""money"" count is funny since I couldn't understand it!
I don't wanna say that the graphics are bad since it's grinding game but the full and empty spaces could've been made a bit clearer!
There was no sound what so ever! etc. etc.
I really don't like giving bad reviews but this one of the fews on which I couldn't hold myself. I time waster for the moment. Might have some potential if the game is finished in production. 
Thumps down for now!

Pretty much nothing works.",0
26835,this game seems to have a lot of potential. it looks good but there is no tutorial and i understood nothing. there also is no in game music and the settings menu doesnt exist but the visuals are good!,1
26836,"I understand that this is in early access, however, MAN am I so lost. There is no tutorial, or hints on what it is you need to do. A lot of it is randomly clicking and hoping something works. 
I get the basics of the bees need to collect pollen from the flowers (which you can also click on), you make storage so they have a spot to place the nectar and pollen. But when it comes to building lets say a hatchery, it tells you it can be made on a storage but no matter what I click, it does not work. 
You can also double click an item (like nectar) to make honey, and then honey to wax, tho it DOESN'T tell you that, I had to watch the trailer 2 times to see it.
Speaking of resources; It would be nice when hovering over your items it TELLS you what it is since they all look really similar. Also I wish there was a better indicator that the hummingbird seeds work? I placed the seed on the ground but it only shows the seed is gone, while not showing a new plant growing which I thought it would do.

I do like the concept and I hope to see if/when this game updates and see it improve <3",0

Turns out I was completely wrong, as nearly nothing here works as it should:

- The game controls with WASD, only that the ""D"" key doesn't register for some reason
- If you look straight up in the sky, the camera can't control itself
- The outside garden seems like an area to roam free, instead there are invisible walls everywhere
- The audio cuts abruptly, which is a constant issue in a simulation that constantly surrounds you with different music sources
- All of the texts are incredibly superficial, simultaneously failing to explain even the most basic terms while also never going in-depth about any of the well-established classics of the era; not even fun trivia or lesser-known-details are included
- At each painting, you have to manually trigger both the music and the page of surface-level information

With more space, polish, effort and finetuning this could be a worthwile ~20 minute gallery but in its current form, ""Psyche60s"" fails as a interactive experience, doesn't work as an educational tool and certainly doesn't offer a trippy, psychdelic or worthwile journey - reading about acid and Rock'n Roll in such a dry, uninvolved and stale manner really doesn't do the subject any justice. 2.5/10",0

In the vast realm of indie gaming, ""Fittest Fire"" emerges as a true gem, weaving a unique tapestry of gameplay that sets it apart from the mainstream. The idea of having the fitness app and logging my exercises boosting my gameplay is a big motivation for me.

Graphics and Art Style (9/10):
""Fittest Fire"" may not boast the high-budget graphics of triple-A titles, but what it lacks in sheer visual fidelity, it more than compensates with its mesmerizing art style. The hand-drawn landscapes, vibrant colors, and imaginative character effects create a visual feast that captivates players from the opening scene. The game's minimalist approach is a testament to the artistry and creativity that can flourish within the indie gaming scene.

Gameplay and Mechanics (8/10):
At its core, ""Fittest Fire"" is a puzzle-platformer with a twist. The mechanics are elegantly simple, yet the challenges presented are anything but. Players navigate through stages, solving puzzles (where to jump back to back etc.) that seamlessly blend with the narrative. The controls are intuitive, and the game strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and depth, ensuring that both casual and hardcore gamers can find satisfaction in its gameplay.

I really enjoyed playing the game. It has it's own challenges and sometimes you need to solve the mechanic to get to the next stage which is entertaining.

26857,"Very fun and unique puzzle game made by a badass dev that coded the entire thing without an engine! I think it has a lot of potential for competition and should be able to find a thriving community over time :D

The base mechanics do take a moment to learn, but once you figure it out the gameplay becomes downright hypnotic. My first play lasted for over 57 minutes and I barely thought it had been 20.

The potential skill ceiling in Polymino is absolutely huge, and the addition of a vs mode with special mechanics and abilities just adds to it even more. I'd be VERY interested to see what the likes of the Tetris community could achieve on this game given the motivation to grind it.

I only had a brief chance to play the vs mode, but it's clear that the developer has and will continue to put a lot of effort into making it interesting and action-packed. With more people playing it I think it will only get better over time!

Controls feel better to me on a controller than on keyboard, but keyboard still works fine. Would suggest using a controller if you can. I believe pretty much anything with a dpad and 4 buttons will work for this game, and I would definitely suggest using the dpad over a stick because 1 click = move 1 gridsquare and that's much more accurate than smooth movement.",1

26862,"If you're looking at this thinking it is just some crummy typing game, you'd be wrong. Apart from having polished as hell visuals which make it a feast on the eyes to play, it's gameplay is also incredibly polished. There are many mechanics which make the gameplay much deeper than ""see letter, press letter"". You have PARRIES, special abilities such as slow mo and bombs, achievements, there are varied enemy types then have varied attacking patterns.

This game feels like an arcade game with modern polish, mechanics, and visuals. It's very cheap and very impressive, you should at least try it.",1
26863,"It's fun, but to be honest I put it all the way to the easiest settings and I was not able to get to the first major game mechanic (looping). I don't really know what is beyond that, but I type for a living and the thing that makes it really hard as the mechanic gets faster and faster is that I never type most of these letters with my left hand. 

None of this is really a criticism of the game, but without any progression mechanics or grindable things you can purchase if you hit a brick wall like I have you're kind of done with the game. A lot of people won't have this issue, but after a few dozen runs I've never even come close to getting past that letter orb thing and I don't think more runs will make it easier. 

I'd be interested to play this with keyboard only as I think that would be easier. I don't know that I've ever played a bullet hell game with the mouse for movement. So I'll check back in occasionally to see if that feature or other features get added to make it so I can experience the rest of the game. I still ultimately recommend it for the price. 

I'm sure a lot of people will dismiss this as someone who's just not willing to grind it out. That's fine if you think that, I almost exclusively play games like this so that's not the issue for me.",1
26864,"I had the luxury of checking out this game while it was in development and watching it get nurtured from a little alien fetus thing into a sweet little baby- A baby that Mavis Beacon's grandson Typing of the Dead had with its partner named Vampire Survivors.

Also whatever awesome score you THINK you got- I promise you in a day someone will beat that by about a million. You're gonna have to hit Q and stuff a hell of a whole lot more to beat THAT person.

Anyway, buy this now- it's worth it.",1
26865,"Unfortunately, although I love the ideas this game has, it is not executed as well as it could be. The menu is riddled with bugs, to the point where I have to click on certain options in order to adjust OTHER options. It seems as though fullscreening the game does not change where the hitboxes are for the buttons on the menu.

As for in game, while I fully admit to not being able to personally keep up with this game's level of difficulty, which is completely fine, trying to fix that by adjusting the ""enemy spawn speed"" does not, in fact, change the enemy spawn speed. And while rapidly switching between 3 keys is fine, it soon becomes 6, then 9, then 13, and I haven't even left ""Loop 1"" yet. So at some point my screen rapidly fills with enemies, and I find myself rapidly spamming QWE while just using bombs on the rest because I don't nearly have enough time to move my hand around the keyboard before being attacked. If I could re-assign the keys, so that I had better control over how far my hand has to travel across the keyboard, maybe I would have less issues with some of it.

The other issue is that the enemies, jewels dropped by enemies, as well as your ""player orb"" can traverse behind the UI, leading to many hits feeling cheap, as it was the only available place to dodge and I could not have known an enemy was hiding behind it. This causes me to naturally stick to the lower half of the screen, allowing for enemies to gang up quickly and perpetuate problem 1. Or, I will hit a few enemies and all their jewels will fly behind the UI, and I just simply ignore them because its not worth risking the hit.

Finally, I have noticed many times where I freely and fully collide with enemies and am not hit, and then times where there are no enemies in the direction I move my mouse and I take damage. I am wondering if this, too, is a disconnect caused by playing in fullscreen. 

The long and short of it is, this game gets very complex very quickly, and not in the fun way. And while I do not possess the skill set this game requires of you, I know that this game does not give me the opportunity to learn it, and increases its pace at such a rapid rate that I am never given enough time to wrap my head around the new letter keys that randomly pop up and start attacking in new patterns. Vampire Survivors has a lot going on, but the player has simple mechanics of movement. This game has just as much going on, if not more, and ALSO asks more of the player. All of this taken with the multiple bugs this game has (at least in the fullscreen experience), and I just don't feel like coming back to it, like I do with VS and other games of its style.",0
26866,"First thing's first.
It's actually easier to define this game by what it is NOT:
1. A typing game. I know what it looks like. I know there is the urge to call it one. See 2.
2, A game where you at any point type full words. That just wouldn't jive with the level of reflex decision making going on here (which is easily the most addicting part of it).
3. A game that uses the full keyboard very frequently. Your six most used keys by far will be q w e a s d. 
4. A game that will hold your hand or explain its mechanics. It doesn't need to, it's a very simple design where everything is clearly communicated and you learn what to do or your run will end.
5. An easy game. The last time I was playing something this unapologetically difficult to progress in, it was Exit the Gungeon.

Don't be put off by any of this. Persevere you will find an instant classic in this game.",1
26867,"Really good! You have to thread the movement needle with your mouse hand while managing a growing horde of chaser enemies by typing. Most typing games ask you to formulate words or sentences, but Typecast is all about the individual letters.

Will probably hop in for quick sessions during downtime in other stuff, since the game is so lightweight and sessions are pretty short.",1
26868,Super simple arcade game that has been polished into the impossible. The voice acting is just the cherry on top. Meta progression would be awesome but that's my monkey brain talking.,1
26869,"It is fun, but very limited - one game mode, kinda like tetris ramping up from easy to hard over time. I was hoping for a twist or new idea for a typing game, and its a very cool idea, but I can't really consider this a typing game since you only learn the left hand.",0
26870,"[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  Those looking for an interesting twist on the typing game, or something completely different.  [/i]

[b] Summary: [/b]  

This is one of those games that you're going to get frustrated with, but in what I think it's a good way. It's an interesting twist on the typing game formula: using the mouse in conjuction with typing, and really punishing the spamming of letters. It feels difficult: but it's more so the fact that you've got to be precise with keys and mouse movement, and if you're used to high mouse DPS, you may want to reconsider that for a game like this. I admit, normally typing games really are in my wheelhouse, but this one caused me a lot of problems: and I like that it did. It felt like a breathe of fresh air in several genres: including survivors. 

The thing is, this is one of those reviews that will probably change over time, mostly because right now? I suck at the game. Like literally, I suck. I probably haven't seen some of the craziest stuff in it. It's still good design: I like the basic of the progression of enemies and what the game throws at you, and I like the tools/health system. It feels balanced. It's just my achilles heel when it comes to the way I play mouse/keyboard games, particularly the mouse.

But the thing is, I wanted to retry it again pretty quickly after every attempt, and I do see progress happening. The music is alright, the visuals are sharp, and it's one of those games I'll play here and there. It's one of my overlooked games of 2023.

26871,"Typecast is a brutal [b]bullet hell[/b] typing game but not the usual style. The controls are unique, since you tap keys to shoot instead of typing words. It's complicated by the fact that you must move the blue ball away from enemies with the mouse. 3 hands would be useful here! I love the control you have over the ball and can get into and out of tricky situations. The game is tense.

The enemy variety should be praised here too since the game is constantly throwing new enemies at you to make it more complicated. Although they do appear in roughly the same order every time. You do need the entire keyboard and my split keyboard makes this game extra difficult.

What's great is that It's easy to jump in and play since there are settings to adjust the challenge. What isn't great is how much the game hides. I wish the scoring was explained a bit more. There's a way to play that will maximize score but I'm still trying to figure it out.

26872,"The idea of the game is great but a bit flawed. On the community Hub, a lot of people asked the possibility to change the Keybinds to kill the enemies, specially to be able to kill the most common enemies with ASD (opposed to QWE), the home row of the querty layout, but the dev really doesn't want to update the game anymore. 

It's important to notice that those reviews were from the same week when the game launched. This game was already abandoned.",0

I'm curious to see how the game will evolve too, because I think there is room for that too !",1
26874,"This is an arcade game where you move with the mouse and attack by typing with your left hand.  Enemies have corresponding letters and when they are in range, pressing that letter will automatically shoot them.  It's an interesting concept with many execution flaws.

First an foremost, it doesn't run well enough.  60 FPS is just not enough for a game like this in the year of our lord 2024.  I have been moving my mouse at 120Hz+ for more than a decade now.

The HUD covers up part of the already cramped play area.  If the play area was just smaller, that might be ok, but there's a strip at the top where enemies can spawn, you can move, and powerups can drop that is completely covered by the opaque hud.

If you press a key when an enemy is not in range, your gun will 'jam' and you will be unable to attack for several seconds, or until you mash that same wrong key a couple times.  I feel this is overly punishing and confusing.  Often, there is an enemy that [b]did[/b] have that letter, but you were just barely out of range.  The difference between being in range and running into the enemy is fairly small and the enemies do not have precise hit boxes, so it's easy to make that mistake and the punishment is too severe.  If you do press a completely wrong key, then having to press the wrong key [i]again[/i], ie repeat your mistake, is an unintuitive way to proceed.  If you press the key one too many times you'll likely jam again immediately.

There is a moment where a huge circle of enemies will spawn and crush in on large portion of the arena.  They have an unusual letter like V or R.  It doesn't show you the letter until they spawn and there just isn't enough time to react.  Plus if you react to early you'll jam because the circle of enemies starts out huge and out of range.  The combination of reaction time + position + precision timing required is just unreasonable to me.

There is a moment where a line of enemies will spawn at the top or bottom of the stage and wipe vertically, covering the whole screen.  They all have the same letter, so this is generally fine.  Except they will spawn directly on top of you with no warning, causing unavoidable damage.

When you game over, it's almost always because of a frustrating chain reaction of falling behind and getting jammed and enemies spawning on top of you or spawning in a weird way due to rng.

There's a bug with the menu where item that is highlighted is not the actual thing you are clicking on. I also ran into problems switching from fullscreen to windowed where the game ended up super zoomed in and cropped into a small window.",0

I think this game succeeds at pretty much everything it's trying to do. I want more games of this sort of scope and scale and quality.",1

26878,"very fun game! i've only played it on the deck so far, and it works really well on it. i feel like i get better every run, which is very satisfying. usually games last for only a handful of minutes, making it suitable to play on the go.
i recommend this game, wahoo",1
26879,"The one word that I'd use to describe this game is:
""Clean"".

The controls are relatively simple without compromising on depth. It is one of the most ""no bullshit"" experiences I've gotten in quite some time. Before we continue, disclaimer, I mostly play this game offline, so my actual time put into this game are a lot higher than the recorded online numbers may suggest.

With that out of the way. So why is it a uber clean game?
Simply put, everything is extremely well thought out and balanced. To put it bluntly, if I die in this game, it is objectively my fault, full stop. The game gives the player just enough mechanics to pull through in any scenario the game throws at them. So unlike some other games, there's never a point where I've ever felt I've been ""cheated"" so to speak. Because again, the game never puts me into unwinnable situations.

Continuing on this idea of ultra balance, each tool/move the game gives the player (right off the bat I might add) has their own trade offs and more importantly, have multiple usage cases. Allowing for extremely noticeable player expression. Its seriously impressive how each player can have their own way of fighting that is immediately noticeable at a glance.

As for those moves (that I'm aware of atm), they're all fairly straightforward.
* Movement: The character is tied to the mouse cursor. Moving the cursor moves the character basically 1:1 to the speed of the cursor. So movement is ultra snappy, fast, and has a immediate feeling of precision.

* Shooting: (Most) Enemies have letters that the player ""needs"" to press to kill them. However, this shooting mechanic has a relatively short range. The bullets also have a travel time. This means two things, one, this is a highly aggressive game, two, even though the shot is relatively accurate, if a enemy is moving fast, the player can still miss.

Secondly, Shooting has a extra mechanic, if you press the key multiple times, it will fire multiple shots. If one of those shots kills the designated enemy, further projectiles can kill anything else in that line even if they aren't the ""correct"" letter.
Meaning you can on paper, extend the range of the shot to hit further targets. (Assuming its timed properly)

Shooting also has a extra mechanic that is INCREDIBLE. Jamming. When the wrong key is pressed, a enemy is out of range, so on, the character will ""jam"" meaning I cannot shoot until I am unjammed. This is done either by waiting, or pressing the key that caused the jam in the first place.

For the first few (and I mean the first VERY FEW) frames of jamming, the character is temporarily invincible and the character turns yellow.
If a enemy hits the character when they're yellow, they will die, spawn more point pick ups than usual, and automatically gets rid of the jam. This is called a ""Parry"".
And no cap, CLEANEST mechanic in video game history!

Here's why, so long as a enemy hits the character when they're yellowed, they will die. There's no real limit to how MANY enemies this can take out. So if there's a bunch of enemies from one end of the screen to the next, I could hypothetically speaking if I am fast enough, clear out all of those enemies with one parry. And, it, feels, insane.

Once the player gets enough points to fill up this bar, some mana and health is recovered. Due to parry's causing enemies to drop more points, this incentives being aggressive without being reckless. Since the parry window is rather small. Btw, it happens SLIGHTLY after the jam. Not immediately at the same time as the character jamming.

As for mana, that leads us to the next two attacks.
One.
* Bombs. It costs a lot of mana to do, but it basically clears everything in the character's attack range.
One really fun application of this is combined with parries. This game is relatively new (at the time of this review) so a lot of techniques don't have names yet. So I'll call this one carpet bombing.
Basically parry into a large group of enemies, set off the bomb, and then get out of there before the invincibility expires.

Two,
* Slowing down time: This drains mana rapidly until the player stops using it, or runs out of mana. When a enemy is parried, it will for a moment, go back to full speed time. So don't use it expecting to clear the screen easily with parries with time slowed down.
It can however make that shooting mechanic where the player presses the same key repeatedly, MUCH easier.

And that's basically the, well, basics. The rest is all skill and player creativity.
For basically $5.00 USD, you get a no bullshit experience that is as skilled based as a game could get. So RNG card fuckery. Just, ""here's your moves, get good with them"".

PS: One last mechanic, when a projectile is parried, it extends the parry window and slightly slows down time. THIS STACKS.
So if there's a lot of projectiles everywhere, you really could just pull off an anime maneuver, run along multiple projectiles (and enemies), and have everything explode the moment time goes back to normal. Yeah did I mention this game is mad satisfying?

PSS: This game can do double duty of being both a excellent warm up game while also being a excellent PC gamer trainer. As it trains basically every fundamental skill imaginable. Positioning, resource management, precision, speed, technique, etc. And again, $5 bucks. From here I would say something that could be improved on but honestly, this game is precisely where it needs to be. The Dev. has a vision and executed it damn near flawlessly.

The literal only nitpick I could think of is that is there's a LOT of enemies on the screen, some of them can block the letter of other enemies if the player is going after those specific ones. But again, due to all the other mechanics in place, much like everything else in this game, skill issue.",1
26880,"Typecast is a beautiful three-axis chimera born from Nuclear Throne, Vampire Survivors, and Typing of the Dead.

It is frenetic, snappy, and enthralling.
It is one of the cleanest and most competently designed roguelikes ever made.
It is one of a scant few clever videogames to truly acknowledges the keyboard.
It is QWOP for Shmup lovers.",1
26881,"Evil and difficult, but a very good and well-executed concept.

Reminds me that I never learned touch-typing.",1
26882,"This is not really a typing game, more a game about you having a LOT of interactions that you have to contend with during fast-paced gameplay. Picture Mario but instead of one ""jump button"" you have an entire keyboard of them and you have to match the letter to the enemy during fast-paced arcade-style gameplay. 

You have to basically leave traditional typing rules behind you to play this game. So it subverted my expectations, because I was expecting a twist on a game that was going to teach me how to traditionally type faster. I'm not bothered by this but thought I'd throw that out there for anyone who may be interested in this for that reason. One thing they did do that I like is they group up the key presses especially at first via typical qwerty rules (qwe, asd, zxc, etc). This does help the onboarding experience significantly, otherwise I think folks would drop off even faster than they probably already do.

This game has huge cognitive overload problems, between the fast pace and the number of button presses that is required. You WILL lose your ""spot"" as your hand hovers over the keyboard and when you look down to see where you are, you probably get hit. It's also worth it to make sure your mouse sensitivity is ""just right."" The gameplay is so fast that sometimes you get punished because a key press is ""wrong"" because everything on the board moves so fast that it gets out of your destroyable zone before you can press the required key. I find these things really made it hard to stay in flow state while playing, which is likely working against this game's favour for many players.

Super hot take here but to me slo-mo feels like the solution to a problem I never said I had. You use a lot of your energy just to get one key press in... Once that's done you go hard into the (very fast-paced) gameplay again with no transition. It's way easier to just get used to how fast the game is and use the bombs instead. But just my opinion.

I feel like I'm being too negative here. The game is ok and Ill very likely play it more, and the price is really reasonable. Overall I'd say if you like bullet hell or super arcade-y games this is something different to play with. I do think this game is niche and I obviously wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking for something more ""chill.""",1
26883,I've always wanted a shmup that uses the mouse and this delivers. Really cleverly designed. Chasing high scores doesn't interest me much but it's fun enough for a go around every once in a while.,1
26884,"almost deceptively deep. i love difficulty/score multiplier systems, and the parry system has a really good feel to it. love to push random buttons to deflect damage and then screw up and die",1
26885,"full disclosure I was given this game for free BUT I can honestly see myself putting so many hours into this. At first I was trash but before long I made it 5+ minutes into loop 1 and felt like an absolute beast.. Give yourself a few tries to get into a flow state. 

I will be back. I need to beat loop 1 at the very least. idk if my brain is powerful enough for subsequent loops but I will try my hand at those too once I get there.",1
26886,"This game embodies the 4 dollar experience in a way that I wish was more applicable to multiple storefronts like an appstore so more people can experience it. Great soundtrack that tries its hardest not to be too repetitive so you can sink hours upon hours without a headache. Simple to learn hard to master oldschool arcade experience that my left hand has difficulty keeping up with from all the carpal tunnel jerk sessions I've had in the past. 

DEFINITELY PLAY THIS",1
26887,"I can already tell this game has legs. The runs are quick and exhilarating! I foolishly skipped the tutorial at first and then later realized I was missing half the mechanics! I gifted the game to a friend due to the sale as well, I hope this game spreads!",1
26888,"Wow, Typecast is so much fun! You move around with your mouse, and attack enemies by hitting the corresponding keys on your keyboard. It's such a fun and challenging thing to balance. Super playable!",1
26889,"This game was actually crazy. You gotta type the letters that are inside your circle. That's it. It get's pretty insane, and your body is just your cursor, so you  need to be quick on your feet. I think what really helps this game is the art style and music. Feels like a joy to play. Try it it's a cheap great roguelike!

26893,"The gameplay was not what I expected, in a bad way.
I was expecting a fully keyboard control, but not kb+mouse, especially when I need to type with only left hand, which is a suffering. I already tried to set the difficulty setting to the lowest but still the control is frustrating me.

I gave really high hope to this game so I didn't even test the game immediately when I bought this (well it's totally my fault), now I cannot refund so I guess you can take my money along with the negative review",0
26894,"If you're on the fence about Typecast, you don't need to be. It's an outstanding arcade score chaser, although the appeal is entirely dependent on enjoying typing games. It's infuriating, but in all the best ways. I've been having a great time trying to work my way up the leaderboard.

I would advise, however, not to be fooled by the aesthetic similarities to Vampire Survivors. They have nothing in common, there are no permanent upgrades and the gameplay is limited to a small arena.

One of the game's biggest weaknesses is how often you end up with crystals near the edge of the screen that can't be picked up without being taken off-guard by upcoming enemies you can't see yet. I understand not wanting to give too much of a magnet radius for balance reasons, but could you perhaps add an indicator arrow pointing in the direction of approaching enemies when you have off-screen letters within your attack radius?",1

As a touch typist who could type 90 to 100 words per minute, I thought this game would be a walk in the park for me. It wasn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt even get past the first loop.

Being an experienced typist didn‚Äôt help me much at all. Although I knew to keep my left hand on the home row (with my right hand on the mouse), I found myself inevitably shifting my left hand to WASD position during the frantic moments. It totally messed me up when I had to press the R, G, H and V keys.

But, with some perseverance, I managed to get far enough to score myself 42,517 points with 723 kills. All I had to show for 4 hours of playing is a screenshot of my game over screen with that record. I didn‚Äôt even earn an achievement for my effort.

26911,"My impressions video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk9rZ-hwjhs

What if Vampire Survivors, but also a typing game?

OK, that's somewhat reductive, but while TYPECAST's inspiration is clear, this is not just another Vampire Survivors clone to add to the sea of those we're seeing from indie devs lately. You will be fending off endless waves of...creatures(?) but you do so by moving your gem around the screen with the mouse and pressing the keys that are on the various enemies. Anything within the circle dies and your score goes up. If you mistype, you have to mash the wrong key to unjam your weapon. You can also build up combos and collect the letters in FEVER to start a score doubling mode.

It's a simple, but very addictive premise. Sessions will often be quick and get quite hard quite fast, but you'll get ""one more run syndrome"" very quickly here because it's so quick to restart a game. While there are no replays, there are online leaderboards, which adds a great competitive element.

TYPECAST is simple, but focused at its core and I think it takes what the industry is quickly turning into a worn out idea and doing something cool with it. Great value for the money.",1

26914,Super fun and scary. I love horror games and it's nice that it's challenging.  Can't beat the price for a game like this.,1
26915,"I'm surprised this game didn't get noticed by many. It's got that Cruelty Squad vibe. I had a hard time beating the first level on  my first play through, but by the second day I beat the first level with zero deaths and even went through the secret area where the ak47 was. I beat all the levels and I am wanting more. I hope the dev doesn't abandon this game, it deserves more levels. The only thing I don't really like is the fact ammo doesn't transfer over to other weapons so you have to backtrack or stick to a certain weapon till you run out of ammo. Also the platforming can be frustrating, wish there was a ability for a double jump or dash. Found the secret skeeves but I don't know what they do.",1

üåü [h1]Overview:[/h1]
[code]""Butterfly Again"" plunges players into a dark fantasy world where magic exists alongside evil entities known as Alluring Demons. Players engage in a gritty narrative where defeating these demons is crucial for survival, not just through combat but through the accumulation of SP to partake in prostitution‚Äîa controversial yet integral part of the game‚Äôs mechanics. This RPG challenges players to navigate morally complex scenarios in a world where only the magically endowed can see the true horrors that lurk.[/code]

üéÆ[h1]Synopsis and Gameplay:[/h1]
[code]In the game, players control two main characters, Butterfly and Mellie, each with their own tragic backstories and diverging paths in the world of prostitution. The gameplay revolves around defeating Alluring Demons to earn SP, which is used to engage in various prostitution activities essential for survival. The combat system is straightforward but requires strategic thinking to maximize the use of SP for both personal advancement and survival strategies.

Throughout the game, players explore diverse settings and interact with different characters. The RPG mechanics are interwoven with a narrative that explores deep themes of exploitation, survival, and personal redemption.[/code]

üìñ[h1]Story and Depth:[/h1]
[code]The story of ""Butterfly Again"" is rich with dark themes and moral complexities. Butterfly, a seasoned prostitute, decides to escape the brothel with Mellie, a newcomer sold by her own parents. Together, they navigate a perilous world, using their wits and bodies to survive and possibly thrive outside the confines of their previous lives in the brothel. The game does not shy away from the harsh realities of their professions, instead using these elements to fuel character development and plot progression.

As they venture through the game's world, Butterfly and Mellie encounter various characters who offer help, hindrance, or temptation, affecting their journey and moral compasses. The narrative delves into themes of freedom, betrayal, and the search for identity in a world that often sees the characters as mere objects.

The bond between Butterfly and Mellie deepens as they face challenges together, leading to a complex dynamic where loyalty and necessity blur the lines of their relationship. The game intricately explores the consequences of their actions, highlighting the complex interplay between survival, and morality in their quest for liberation. [/code]

üèÜ[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
[code]""Butterfly Again"" offers an intense, immersive experience that is not for the faint of heart. It combines traditional RPG elements with a story that challenges the player's ethics and emotional resilience. The game's mature content, involving themes of prostitution and survival, is handled with a narrative depth that respects the seriousness of the subject while providing a compelling gameplay experience.

The combat system, while simple, supports the game's darker themes by linking survival directly to the characters' ability to engage in prostitution, a stark commentary on the dire situations they face. This setup provides a unique gameplay mechanic that intertwines with the story, enhancing the overall depth and impact of the game.

For players seeking a game that pushes boundaries and explores dark, mature themes with sensitivity and complexity, ""Butterfly Again"" is a must-play. It offers not just a game, but a narrative journey that questions the limits of what one is willing to do for survival. The replay value is high, with different choices leading to new revelations and outcomes, encouraging players to explore all facets of this richly crafted world.[/code]

""Butterfly again"" is a dystopian story-rich JRPG. The primary focus is the story as it is a narrative-driven game but great thought has been put into the battle system (even if it isn't overly complex). You play as Butterfly and Mellie on their way to go back to Mellie's village and to her father that sold her off. Their journey has many unexpected turns and twists that will surprise you and, as the story unfolds, it will become darker and darker..

Seemingly filled with innocence, our girls and the world are far from it.. And that's what makes it so sinister and deep. There is a twist that you won't see coming, despite the hints throughout the game. Are you sure it's all over?.. ^^

In this world not everyone can use magic. Only those that can use magic can see the Alluring Demons and realize the Insect Demon's infestation that's been plaguing the kingdom. It's up to you to figure out what's going on and survive. The girls will need to adapt and grow in order to reach their journey's destination. Meanwhile, Butterfly starts remembering..

Hidden behind the innocence facade, lies a sinister and twisted world filled with magic. Delusions and illusions run rampant until paranoia strikes the final nail on the coffin of this immoral world. But, not everything is what it seems and sometimes the victim can be the perpetrator, even if it appears to be the opposite. Desire can be created and manipulated; it is a seed that you can plant..
Apathy, lies, secrets, manipulation, abuse, taking advantage of, love, desire, lust, innocence, naivety, being oblivious and blind to the facts are only the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface an abundance of social, psychological, patriarchal and feminist issues arise, that, if you indeed think about them deeply, will make your head spin.
A briliantly crafted story that will upset your stomach in a subtle and calm way all while being filled with raw and lustful sexual acts.

[b]Warning: The game is twisted. I loved the bottom line and the way it is expressed. It's very powerful but, I must stress out that if you can't stand hard scenes with below 18 girls, then this game isn't for you. Abuse, humiliation, torture and degradation come in many forms and shapes; not everything is about raw power and brutal violence. While this isn't overly aggresive, the psychological aspect of it might leave many at unease.[/b]

The combat is turn based. The difference here is that there Œ±œÅŒµ no armors or weapons. You only get to chose 2 willstones out of a big selection that you either earn or buy. There needs to be synergy between the 2 characters in order to win the tough fights. Oh! And there miiiigt be some costumes for you to find ^^
It seems simple and for the most part it is but, some willstone powers are very technically complex and I'm glad to see them used (the complexity of the [spoiler]desire-purple willstone[/spoiler] took me aback - don't forget the game engine). There are a couple of consumables but, you have to plan for them, as you can only use them prior to a battle. You need SP to unlock the prostitution events that are crucial for your survival!

You can replay all the unlocked scenes in the memory room (gallery) but, contrary to past games, you can't unlock them at will. The artwork is very good, detailed and fully uncensored! It really helps with understanding the mindset of the characters and how they feel.

I'm glad to see that the translation is good and[b]a lot[/b] better than the previous games of the developer! Only some few grammatical errors and misspellings. Like in the other games, the same problem with some text being cut off at the edges of the dialogue boxes exists. Here it isn't as bad and, generally, it won't break the immersion or make you miss something. The most annoying thing is probably the willstones' descriptions, as for some you might need to experiment to fully understand what they do, due to the bottom text being cut off. It has good flow and the dialogues are natural, like someone would actually speak in real life and not like a machine or direct word to word translation that makes little to no sense.

The game runs perfectly. All the mechanics and features work without any issue or bugs.

26933,"The game is too text heavy, and when skipping most of the text, the story becomes void and the even the  skipping is slow. The ""interesting"" part is not more interesting than what som AI can draw. I think there is 13 scenes, that are very vanilla. The escort part of the gameplay is really nothing, just a way to unlock some still images.
I fell asleep two times while trying to give this game a chance.",0
26934,"Wow... i did not expect all this from this game.
It is... phenomenal. So let's start from the little things - and i do not mean the girls starring in the main roles ToT
The music might all be public domain but it is very well selected and high quality. Fans of Black Souls will recognize a few tunes... fans of Black Souls will also like this game in general and not only for the cunny.
The combat isn't hard but it has its twists to the usual rpgmaker formula. Combat is all about magic and your MP(not to be confused with Mana) is limited to 10. It recovers each turn a little bit but your attacks and skills can cost anywhere from 1 to 9. It also doesn't return to max between battles nor after leveling up so you need to use it well - MP recovery items are rare and a bit expensive. [spoiler]There is also a reason why they are not called mana potions but ""flu medicine""[/spoiler]
After each battle you get SP and EXP. Exp is self-explantatory. SP meanwhile... calling it ""sex points"" wouldn't be wrong but by the end of the game you will know that it actually stands for [spoiler]Spread Parasite[/spoiler]
Battles don't earn you gold - sex does. To have sex you need to have enough SP and find a client. Then you can use the gold either to buy regular items or a thing called ""Willstones""... which you will learn the true nature of later. But for now, think of them as equippable skills. Most of them teach you a new spell and raise some attribute. Some only raise attributes. You only have 5 slots at a time though so you have to swap them around.
Now... to the story. On the surface, you are a little loli mesugaki who escaped from the brothel together with an oppai loli on a whim. The loli mesugaki's name is ""Butterfly"" and said butterflies are a common symbol in the game. She slowly remembers various things during her travels... or maybe, she knew them all along and is just sharing them with us? Either way... none of those things are good.
I decided to stop myself short from spoiling everything in a big spoiler section. Find that for yourself by playing. I finished the game in 5 hours but a certain optional boss would require a bit more grinding than that. Still, the story is really amazing and it will stay with me for a while.
...the cunny is pretty good too ;3
As for problems - there is a bit of text wrapping problems and a few text boxes that aren't translated or have a bit wonky grammar. But it is better than many other chinese games i've seen translated on steam.
Now, the only single spoiler i will leave you with is that there is a happy ending - because even loli prostitutes deserve respect and happiness.
10/10 would uooohhh for Butterfly again ToT",1
26935,"A rather shorter side of the rpgmaker eroge, this game took me about 6-7 hours to both beat and 100% this game have a really good story- infact, I think it's the main selling point, with the plot twist sprinkled through the story itself, I didn't expect it at all, it made whole lot of sense and conceptually, it's very cool. I really like the world building that leads the plot to the twist. The game have 2 Endings(?) Good and Bad ending apart from your generic ""game over"".

Now for what I don't quite like about the game, The art itself is great, its well drawn, however the creative choice behind it are.. questionable at best, out of very little CGs it had, there's only 2 H-scene that I like, with only 17 H-scene in total. There's option to ""do it"" with other NPC but there's no actual changes to the scene itself, but only the dialogue- which I don't really read. Lastly, the battle system, I understand why they make it like how they make it, but it is really unintuitive and not fun, making most of the passive skill useless, hell, I still don't understand the MP mechanic with the character having 30++ MP but ended up only capping at 10 while in combat, difficulty itself are quite easy and there's not much to talk about.

Overall 6/10 - Maybe wait for discount or when you got alot of money to spare
TLDR;

Pros:
Nice art
Good story, character, and worldbuilding

Cons:
Very little CG & Repetitive
Unintuitive battle system
Some translation error",1
26936,"I haven't finished this game yet, and I have to say... This isn't what I expected at all.

First of all, gameplay is fun, meaningful, and challenging (unlike many games of the same kind). Sexual content is mandatory for gameplay, not a side stuff you can skip since this game features prostitution as a main theme, and you literally have to do it for survival (don't forget to apply R18 patch on their official website).

What makes this game beautiful though, is the story, the characters, and its thematic narrative.

The game tackles the morality of being a prostitute, not just the normal kind of prostitute also, ch**d prostitution.

You will get to play as a couple of children having to do stuff in order to survive on this harsh world, where you need money to be independent, to procure food and place to sleep, to survive, and not everyone will see you in a good light as it is considered a dirty job for many.

This is just one of the main theme though. The game is much more than that.

It is a world where magic exists... for some.

Suddenly, monsters appear on places throughout the country. Most people couldn't see them at first, but some do, and the ones seeing them are prone to be attacked by them. These monsters only attack people capable to see them. They aren't as helpless though, since if you can see monsters, you will be capable of using magic to fight as well.

There are mystery to explore regarding this stuff, and you'll get to explore it while traveling the world selling your body here and there in order to stay alive.

This game is awesome. If you can handle this kind of stuff, you won't regret buying it.",1

[b]Butterfly Again[/b] is a game that's not for everyone due to the characters' designs and the subject matter, but it's a surprisingly engaging JRPG once you get past that. It features a decent story about the journey of Butterfly and Melly as they search for the latter's father and entertaining game mechanics that take some inspiration from FFVII while giving it a unique touch. So yeah, give it a shot if you're looking for an entertaining JRPG and you don't mind the err... ""cute and funny"" characters.",1
26938,"Okay, I've had some time to think and have started my first replay, academics can wait. I should preface this by saying that my initial thoughts are below, marked with the date and play time. I also feel the need to state that I am not a picky reader at all and enjoy almost everything, with my average VNDB rating being ~8.5.

I should start with what I consider more superficial but still impactful aspects of a visual novel. I had no problems with the visuals and found them to be quite nice, although I admit they are far from the best I've seen (particularly I noticed during the ending credits, the compression was usually high). 
The audio was quite pleasant, although nothing sticks out in particular to me. I hope this changes once I listen to the soundtrack a bit more and identify my favorite tracks.
And finally, I found the UI and controls to be a bit confusing at first since they mostly utilize the function keys, but maybe an hour in I found it to be non-intrusive and easy to learn, so I wouldn't mind seeing this UI and keyboard layout in the future. 

As for the characters, I realize they are not as well developed as, say, those of Little Busters!, but given the run time I think this VN does a good job. I admittedly can't really relate to Ryusei in any way, as I'm a rather boring person, but I found him to be a fun character that I could find myself getting along with, which made it easy for me to get absorbed in his story and feel the weight of its events. Ginka is absolutely adorable and I should stop myself from spoiling anything. I also enjoyed the rest of the cast; although they fit rather neatly into their stereotypes, I personally find no problem with that. It's an easy way to accelerate their characterization, so if anything I think it works in GINKA's favor. 

And finally, the story. Once again, the individual components aren't really that unique. If you've read any significant number of visual novels, you've seen all these troupes before. But personally, I really enjoyed how they interwove these story components, and how it all came together. 
The foreshadowing and flashbacks set up the story really well in my opinion; the VN will tell you the full story if you just want to turn your brain off and enjoy it, but if you enjoy theorizing the story as it happens, I think GINKA both sets you up for those predictions, as well as throws some unexpected curve balls. It's was very enjoyable for me, as you might be able to tell. 
And of course, can't have a romance story without romance. I think this is rather subjective so I'll just give my impression, I thought Ryusei and Ginka were very cute together, and I love a good childhood romance. Nakige is my favorite genre, so I enjoy all aspects of these games. The romance, drama, humor, all come together to make a beautiful story, and the cheesy, cliche, and even slightly cringe moments are just the cherry on top. 
I still am processing what the story means to me, as I found a lot of points touched on in the story to be very thought provoking, so I'll mostly skip that for now. Suffice to say, I think this resonates with me in a way that the To The Moon series does, which I referenced in my earlier reaction. 
Overall, I greatly enjoyed the story and think it is very well put together. 

Finally, to address the elephant in the room, yes this is basically Summer Pockets Lite with sprinkles of other nakige. I find no problem with that, although I'm also the type of person to reread a story over and over again and enjoy just as much every single time. If you, for some reason, despise seeing the same story and troupes over and over and haven't read Summer Pockets Reflection Blue, I'd point you in that direction instead of GINKA. That's not to say GINKA isn't good, in fact if you've made it to this point you surely can tell I love it, but Summer Pockets RB is unquestionably one of my favorite narratives of all time. 

If you've made it through this word-vomit of a review, then I need not tell you that I heavily recommend this game. All its aspects come together to make a wonderful experience with a captivating story and lovable characters. I hope this visual novel becomes popular (well, as popular as a visual novel can get outside of Asia) because I think it's a very approachable and well written story considering its length of only ~10 hours. I hope you enjoy this visual novel as much as I have!


(2023.10.27; 7.9 hours)

Despite the looming threat of two midterms and two design reviews, I tore through this game. Although it's past 3 AM, I need to get my thoughts down.

First and foremost, what an amazing story. GINKA nailed literally every point for me. The music, graphics, drama, humor, and even the cheesy and cliche moments, GINKA did not miss a beat. There is not doubt in my mind that GINKA has quickly become one of my favorite visual novels of all time. 

As I'm writing this, I feel the same soul-lifting joy that I felt after finishing Little Busters!, Summer Pockets, and ATRI. It hard to explain but it's an incredibly freeing feeling, the pure joy I feel for Ginka and Ryusei, as well as all the other characters. Despite the relatively short length, all the characters grew on me and I got completely absorbed by the story. From the depths of despair to the hard fought moments of hope, happiness, and triumph, this is nakige at its finest. 

On that note, the story. Absolutely incredible. I stand by the fact that its individual aspects are not particularly unique, but the storytelling and overall composition are masterful. The foreshadowing and flashbacks were engaging, and made for an enjoyable active reading experience. Whether I was completely blind sided or nailed a prediction, I couldn't get enough of the story. I absolutely need to read this game again soon, as I'm sure I missed many details and foreshadowing, and I have yet to collect my thoughts on GINKA's overall message, and what it means to me. I shouldn't spoil anything, but at least for me, the story had me deeply contemplating at times. In a way, it reminds me of the To The Moon series (another one of my favorites) for those who have played that.

Wrapping this up, in the simplest words, reading GINKA has brought me incredible joy. As you can probably tell by my rambling, this game has deeply impacted me in a way that few stories have. What a beautiful visual novel; I wait in great anticipation for future releases. 



(2023.10.26; 2.7 hours)

I really shouldn't be playing this now because of midterms and other projects I have to work on, but I couldn't help myself. Just a few hours in and I can confidently say the experience so far has been amazing and I can't imagine that I won't continue to enjoy this story.

To be honest I don't think the story is particularly novel, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. Without spoiling anything [spoiler]I imagine most people could predict the first plot twist; at least I saw it from a mile away, although that's also a compliment since I've enjoyed their foreshadowing and doing some of my own brainstorming and prediction as the game went on. [/spoiler]

At the moment it feels very much like Summer Pockets Lite, which is by no means a complaint since I am a huge fan of Summer Pockets and Key in general.

If you've played ATRI or Summer Pockets, I imagine you will enjoy this visual novel as I have so far. Wish my grades good luck because they're taking a back seat until I finish GINKA.",1
26939,"First hour of playing
Apart from feeling a bit disappointed with the UI, it seems to be pretty good.
Transitions and animation are looking a bit cheap, though they are not bad. 

First impression
It is hard to express into words but, at the moment, I do not regret purchasing it.

-planning to edit after finish the whole thing 
",1
26940,"It took me 14 hours to get through the whole story but it felt longer since I felt like nothing new was really happening until the very end. I felt like this game would have played with the heart strings a little but in the end there wasn't a scene that left an impact on me.

Now the music was good but it doesn't have the effect like the music from other visual novel's where I'd remember a specific moment in the game whenever the song comes on. I do love the character designs as well as their personality, lots of fun and cute moments which kept me reading. The ability to have JP and ENG text at the same time was a nice surprise. 

Overall I just wouldn't recommend it at the current price, definitely would on a sale though.",0
26941,"It was a great story overall. I personally found the ending a little disappointing. I'm not even totally sure why. Probably something to do with the ""[spoiler]it was all a dream[/spoiler]"" trope even though I realize that isn't entirely what happened.",1
26942,"I have mixed feelings about this one. I can't really say that it's bad and not recommend it but I wouldn't go in expecting a kamige out of it, ATRI is way too good and it'll be hard to come up with something similar. It was a fine read imo. The characters, CG's and music were all magnificent and it would be alot better if it had animation given that it's a modern 2023 VN but I had problems with some portion of the stories especially near the end. 

[spoiler] 
There was a kami Deux Ex Machina that solved all the problems and gave the characters the best possible ending in an alternate universe where there were no misunderstanding.

The chuunibyo portion of the VN was totally unnecesary. I really wish VN's would stop doing this, it changes the atmosphere and ridicules the whole thing. Same thing i've seen happen in other VN's where the tone is mysterious and then all of a sudden we're witnessing a cringe version of Jujutsu Kaisen.

Sometimes it felt like the only part worth reading was when the background OST was ""magic hour"". [/spoiler] 

For me, this is a 6/10",1
26943,"Nothing exceptional but a good read regardless 

Story pretty straight forward with some twists other than that it is pretty predicable .
Could have add more activity to the whole summer + island theme instead of 1-2 and then summary.
Decent characters, pretty nice to see some development for side characters.
Decent soundtracks but only 1-2 stick out for me.

Overall, its worth the money. 
8/10 for me
",1
26944,"Initially, I expected Ginka to provide a similar experience to Atri, one of my favorite visual novels, but the story turned out very different and surprised me in various ways. 
Ginka, despite having ‚ÄúLove‚Äù as the driving force of the story, isn‚Äôt romantic-centric like Atri; it‚Äôs more of a mystery, intriguing, action type of story with romance as an afterthought.
Foreshadows are provided throughout the story that all come together at the end, bringing a satisfactory conclusion. All remaining questions were answered in the after-story which is rather nice despite taking more than half a year since the release day to do so.
The CGs are terrific, the OST is good but not remarkable. I wish the writer expressed the romantic aspect of the relationship between the main couple more colorful since the ‚Äúpureness‚Äù of their love was established too early and remained unchanged even when the story ended, to be honest, it was frustrating that the couple didn‚Äôt express more affection despite so much hardship they went through together. 
Overall, Ginka is a truly engaging story that can keep your eyes glued to the screen till the curtain falls. Definitely check it out if you‚Äôre a fan of mystery, devoted love, and mythology stories.

26945,"Finally finished it after 13 hours of reading
I thought it will be like ATRI or Summer Pockets but I'm wrong, they only have a few things in common.

26946,"Great art, music and voice acting, the story is a roller coaster in a very good way but I didn't expect less when I saw the same people who did ATRI also had a hand in it. 

The story consists of two main parts, the first half is a bit predictable but it estabilishes all the characters well. 

The second half really starts throwing out some good twists. Still, it's not overly dramatic or angsty which felt pretty fresh to me as a lot visual novels go hard on the tearjerking bits usually. 

I really liked the ending, everything was concluded beautifully. Hoping this one also gets the anime treatment one day.

26947,"Just finish read this takes 10 hours+
I gotta say ( this still can't beat ATRI ) but it is still good read and unique in it's own way. 
The plot twist is good tho or maybe like too many twist? Sometimes idk like where are we again? 

The artwork amazing!

Ended up buying this vn because it was similar to ATRI. I can't say which one is objectively better, but if you liked ATRI, this is definitely worth a try.

I'm so glad there are extra & afterstory, completed the whole vn in two sessions. Be prepared for heartbreak and shock, even if [spoiler]the ending is happy[/spoiler] this story hurts and touches my heart deeply. 

It's projects like this that make me love visual novels. Loved the OST and BGs

But this vn also has its downsides, unfortunately the maximum resolution of the game without pixelation is 720p, which is why you have to play in a window and all the most interesting things start to happen towards the end and in the extra (next), but this problem now extends to many novells.

IMO this novel is very beginner friendly, so if you have little experience with this genre, it's worth giving it a try!
Must read&play, 9/10. Looking forward to the adaptation, if there is one (I hope)!",1
26958,"A masterpiece of a VN. A lot of seemingly confusing mysteries, but it all comes together by the end. Absolutely stunning art, music, and voice acting. Did not think it could live up to the post-Atri hype, but it did! Play GINKA!!!",1

26964,"OK, this was a really good VN, probably a solid 8/10. I will have to say it's not perfect though. It took me about 15 hours to get a full playthrough. This is one of the few VNs I actually wanted to take my time and read all of the text. Don't expect any adult content, this is a childhood longing that carries into being grownups, and that is absolutely fine.

The art is fantastic, the music is ... ok. There is a lot of supernatural things that happen, and plenty of twists even after the ""main twist."" There's a lot to unpack in the story. 

There is one ""true route,"" 2 bad ends, and 1 end that's bittersweet, and probably should have been the true ending.  The ""after story"" is surprisingly long, and is where the bulk of the story really is. I think it was a bit convoluted and could have been trimmed down a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's a good story, but it kind of runs out of steam towards the end. 

If you get the true end, [spoiler] make sure you click ""extra"" again to get the true, true end [/spoiler]

One real gripe I have is the CG library only has the absolute minimum number of characters in it. I know Ginka is the story, but where's the pictures of Rin, Sensei, and the others??

If you are trying to learn Japanese, you can have both English and Japanese subtitles on the screen at the same time. Also, the interface is top notch, with plenty of save slots and customization options. No flow chart though, so save at the choices.

Thankfully I managed to read before the JP Ginka Package arrives and reading it definitely made me more motivated to actually get the package (Special Edition with Dakimakura Cover)

Now for GINKA itself, I don't have heart issues but I definitely relate to Ryuusei's heart issues whenever things happen. I liked the story's overall direction from start to end -- if you could call it that since in the end its like connecting two dots together but you go do a lot of detours before finally connecting them. That is how I ended up thinking of how the flow went but that isn't a bad thing. I almost cried while reading certain parts but once the credits rolled out I was just tearing up.",1

26968,"I liked the game, nice music, art, and characters. The story was good, but I think I liked Atri My Dear Moment‚Äôs story better. When I finished Atri I felt a more satisfied. It might be due to me not liking the supernatural element of the game and it‚Äôs implication on the story. Having magic allows the story to (major spoilers)[spoiler] magically solve problems and they all live happily ever after because the powers of god[/spoiler] it is still a good story and a decent ending though.

Note: the above is my original thoughts from a few months back. Now after playing the new After story, I will say the after story made me like the ending A LOT better since the original ending felt way too abrupt.

In case anyone is wondering, I keep mentioning Atri My Dear Moments because they are made by pretty much same staff development wise except VAs. Highly rec both games. Also this game reminded me of Summer Pockets as well, another favorite. There's an expanded version called Summer Pockets Reflection Blue that should get an official translation soon. Or, you can buy and download on Dlsite, then look up Alka Translations who did a really good fan translation on it.",1
26969,"By the end I was very conflicted on how I feel about my time with this one. Overall, I appreciate the experience but at the same time I feel annoyed because I expected and wanted something else out of it.

I wanted a blossoming relationship between two childhood friends but I never got that. Instead, I was left as frustrated as the MC at some points with the weird meandering directions the story was taking.
The big overarching story surrounding the island and its inhabitants plays a very big role and keeps being  highlighted as such to the point where the VN is all about that, but I ended up not caring as much about it because it treated the two characters I cared about the most like garbage and by the end they were nothing but passengers. The story made the main heroine behave in ways that frustrated me even though it made sense, and everything else just felt like it was getting more and more absurd the longer it went with all the new problems the MC was faced with. 

I probably would've enjoyed it a lot more if I didn't want a romance so badly. Because of that, I'm left peeved. Regardless of what I want however, I would say that this VN is still fairly solid. Good artwork along with characters I enjoyed reading about. The story outside the two main characters is fine despite it not being aligned with my interests and desires for the VN. If you can go into this wanting to know more about the whole picture rather than hyper focusing on the main pair like I did, you'll probably like it.

26988,"[b][i]Open-world RPG with spells in the form of a deck of cards and hardcore turn-based combat in the form of a button-mashing mini-game.[/i][/b]
Gameplay:
https://youtu.be/AUWluBXbKlg

Everspell is reminiscent of the ROBLOX Game ""Arcane Lineage"". You explore the world around you in real time, trade and communicate with NPCs, complete quests and fight monsters in hardcore turn-based battles.

The character has an inventory with items and equipment. You can use weapons and armor.
There is a special inventory for spells. Spells are like cards, you build your deck before battle.

As soon as the battle begins, the game moves you to an arena divided into a grid layout. You can move your character across the cells of the field and attack the enemy with spells.
To cast a spell, you must have time to press a sequence of buttons that the game will show you.

[u]You can read other reviews and subscribe to our curators. Welcome![/u]

26989,"Everspell is a simple tactical RPG that uses vector graphics. It's very likely from a solo developer, though I can't confirm this for certain. 

You choose a character class and begin wandering around a semi-open-world engaging in turn based combat. The game incorporates some light platforming elements. 

Unfortunately, the game suffers from balance issues and various UI choices that make it a chore to play. A general list of these: 

 A. When casting spells and using abilities, you have to play very small mini games which involving tapping keys in a sequence. If you fail these games, your spell will fail. This mechanic is clunky and overtuned. 
B. Several UI elements are text only, and placed directly over things you do not want to click. This can result in dropping abilities. 
C. Stat bars and other elements lack texturing and polish. This isn't particularly an over sight, it's just hard to look at sometimes. 
D. Enemy life bars are fairly chunky. This can result in combats which are a foregone conclusion continuing for many turns longer than they need to. 


It's quite likely the mechanics of the game need some revisiting. The developer would likely find better results hyper focusing on specific game mechanics and fleshing them out. Currently the card choose mechanic for abilities isn't complex enough or interesting, and the mini-games-for-spells mechanic just gets in the way. It's hard to say who the target audience is here... Some parts of the game suggest a nice entry level tactical game for children, but the punishing nature would put off most adults. 

Hopefully it's developer Bublik's first attempts at running out a unity engine game, and they can take some of this on board and produce some better games in future. Compiling a functioning game is always an achievement. 

No specific game breaking bugs encountered.",0
26990,"From the little I've played what's easy to tell, is that the dialogues with NPC's and the cutscenes have been interesting so far.

Regarding the combat I've been able to unlock quite a few spells although I've just started the game. The game encourages experimentation as the player can switch around a variety of spells to see how each of them works for thier playstyle, combining them is also another factor that adds even further dept to the game. 

One final thing I'd like to note is that the music is great, hope the full soundtrack is released at some point. Going to be putting more hours into this game as time goes on and I recommed you pick it up too.",1
26991,One of the best indie strategy games to come out this year. I love the simplicity of combat and the exploration that comes along with it to enhance my experience. Definetely give this a try!,1
26992,"""Everspell"" is an RPG masterpiece that swept me away into a world of enchantment and adventure from the very first moment I stepped foot into its immersive realm. As an avid gamer, I've traversed countless virtual landscapes, but none have captured my imagination quite like Everspell.

One of the most captivating aspects of Everspell is its vast and meticulously crafted world. From sprawling forests teeming with mythical creatures to towering castles shrouded in mystery, every corner of the game is begging to be explored. Each area is brimming with detail and lore, making every journey a new and exciting experience.

But Everspell isn't just about exploration; it's about the journey you take and the characters you meet along the way. The diverse cast of characters you encounter throughout your adventure are richly developed, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. Whether you're teaming up with allies to vanquish powerful foes or engaging in heartfelt conversations with NPCs, every interaction feels meaningful and memorable.

Beyond its stunning visuals and engaging gameplay, Everspell also boasts a captivating storyline that kept me hooked from start to finish. From epic battles against ancient evils to heartwarming moments of camaraderie, the narrative unfolds in a way that is both gripping and emotionally resonant.

In conclusion, Everspell is a true gem of the RPG genre, offering a captivating world to explore, memorable characters to meet, and thrilling gameplay to experience. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent in its enchanting universe, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to fellow adventurers seeking their next epic quest.",1

27001,"Great collectathon platformer full of little details and flourishes in the animations, texture work, and level design that give it a tonne of charm and character. The game is split up into dense open-ended stages with collectibles scattered all over the place (some obvious and some fiendishly tucked away) with the mandatory ones unlocking additional levels, and the secret ones unlocking cosmetics, concept videos, and even new levels. It's a fun little throwback that wears its influences (Sly Cooper, mostly) on its sleeve, and I really [i]really[/i] had a lot of fun with it. I sincerely hope we get a sequel in the future.

The main hero is a mouse, which is cool. Worth it.",1
27003,"The developer sent me a copy of this game for review, and I really enjoyed it. Very much in the vein of 2000's collect-a-thons with its animal protagonist and open level design. I've always loved the ""exploring human spaces as a very small character"" aspect of it, and it even felt a little Tome and Jerry-ish, which is a good thing. There were only a couple things I would change: 1) add a little more music so it isn't quite so repetitive, and 2) make the forks easier to land on (maybe I'm the only one who's bad at it). Regardless, this is a solid game which I enjoyed a lot.",1
27004,"It's pretty small of a game and a little rough around the edges, but boy, this is one heck of a Sly Cooper clone, and an incredibly great one at that! Platforming is very reminiscent of that, the atmosphere works so well in the levels which are all incredibly engaging to traverse in, and the extra content is definitely something I'll be sure to come back to for more fun! All helped by the overall presentation of the game with its cell shaded art style, sound design for collecting cheese, jumping, attacking and such, as well as the great musical score provided by the accompanying soundtrack. 

Me only real complaint with the game is that there's only one save slot, meaning if I want to come back and do a fresh new play-through of the game, I have to delete progress from me last save which...was never something that aged well between the 7th and 8th generation of gaming and for good reason. And considering that time trials are a thing in this game, with time records to beat, yeah, I'd much rather avoid deleting me old save if it means I can keep that record saved for meself.

But that's really it as far as criticisms goes. Other than that, game's still pretty great! Can't wait to see how much more gets added to this game as time goes on!",1

[i]a futuristic Ukrainian detective Story[/i]

Have you ever made a video game? Maybe yes.
Have you ever made a video game in a warzone? Probably not.
[i]Brenntkopf Studio Kharkiv[/i] from Ukraine have.
[b]Son of Perun Kharkiv[/b] is the fifth (!) game the studio released since the full-scale invasion. I bought their first game out of curiosity, then I got all in into this niche. I really like indie games. I really like indie games with voice-over in various languages. I like first-person-shooters. Son of Perun Kharkiv is all three.
It comes with a energetic soundtrack straight from the city. I will link the full soundtrack below. The game has four well-placed achievements. You will be able to earn all achievements during one play-through. 
Play the game to get into the story. It‚Äôs about a badass war veteran cop who‚Äôs on a mission in a rough city with lack of morals but surplus of caffeine.
The humor is fantastisch, fighting is well-balanced and all the characters speak Ukrainian Language. For a indie shooter there is surprisingly much voice-acting! Mission text and npc-dialogues all have voice-over. Huge respect.

See you in Kharkiv!

Firstly i want to say this game has huge potential, talking as a professional game quality assurance tester. 

Unfortunately, it is not currently close to being up to par in my unbiased opinion. There are so many aspects that not only need to be improved but also completely reworked. 
I hope the dev reads this whole thing attentively, for the same reason i did not refund this game. I think you can improve, and i think you can learn a lot. I really really want this game to be good, and i think it could be insanely fun with enough work put into it.

Im going to list off the things that popped to mind as i played casually without trying to search for bugs or break the game : 

[list]

    [*]The farming system needs an overhaul. It is way too long and tedious to water and ferment every plant one by one, to an extent where it is much easier to completely ignore this aspect of the game to get wood, rock and buy stuff from the merchant.

    [*]Speaking of the merchant, i understand he is called the wandering merchant, however he wanders way too far and wastes a lot of your time just to find and get to him, even by using the map. 

    [*]We desperately need a clock, watch, timer, anything to indicate what point in the day we are. Exploration is clearly encouraged, however, you nearly cannot explore at all before night comes and you are too far to get back in time. Additionally, days need to be longer to make the resource gathering, exploring, and crafting viable in any way. 

    [*]The sprint speed is satisfying considering the lack of time, and the enormity of the map. However, Cave exploration is rendered unremarkable as you can simply run past every enemy, press e on the chest, and leave. I recommend adding a ""Kill all enemies"" restriction to these chests, as well as better rewards in them. 

    [*]There are lots of unfortunate glitches that need to be worked out, such as pressing escape in any menu such as inventory or the shop will softlock your game and lose your save without exception. Sometimes the audio does not play at all, which is a shame because i think your audio is one of the strongest points of this game currently.

    [*]The inventory would also need to be reworked, as it currently feels very clunky. I wish when i bought or crafted items, they went straight into the empty spaces of my hotbar. Id love if the hotbar had more slots as well. The click and drag, is tedious as you need to click, stop clicking, move to the hotbar, then click again which can be severely annoying in normal times, and infinitely more so during combat.

    [*]The game could benefit from a short tutorial explaining crafting, resource gathering, farming and combat. I understand games that don't hold hands and i respect that, but even dark souls has a short explanation of its main features.

    [*]There needs to be more tower defence aspects, i think you could take inspiration from games such as Plants VS Zombies to merge your farming and defence to an extent as there are so many enemies.

    [*]The map is pretty and big, however it feels empty as there are not many places to actually explore, or they are all very far apart. I think you could add some more simple cabins, camp grounds, roads, fences and etc just to give it a bit of life.

    [*]I think detailed damage and HP could be added as descriptions to items and weapons, perhaps also to enemies.

    [*]I don't know if there is a repair tool or not, i could not find it if so. I really wanted to repair everything. 

    [*]I don't understand why you put so much emphasis on the game being an FPS when there is no shooting, only melee weapons. Perhaps you could lean into the fantastical such as the monsters and make magic related weapons?

    [*]This game would benefit a flood-worth from 4 player co-op multiplayer in all aspects. It would be several times more manageable, more fun and overall a better experience. Even if the game remained exactly as it currently is, but with multiplayer, it would be much more worth putting in some hours with friends to survive more than 3 days.

Finally, i apologize profusely that i wrote such a long amount of text. I am so incredibly frustrated that i did not have fun playing this game, when the concept was so interesting to me. I know you are a solo dev or small team, and i know its easy to say all these things, when they would takes months of work to pull off. My sincere hope is that you do pull it off, because i think you can. 

Don't hesitate to add me if you want to talk about it, im sorry again i was so insanely critical.",0
27055,"As of right now I cannot recommend this game. There is clearly potential, but with no news for any planned update and the current state of the game I would say don't buy this.

Negatives:
Currently it is incredibly difficult to survive the first night. It took me probably three tries or so. The pacing of this game is rushed, the direction is lacking, the hitboxes have a lot of play in them (for enemies and for things like watering your crops), the balancing of resources you obtain versus the amount you need is not quite there (it's not the worst but the jankiness scales with how rushed you are to get turrets and fences down just so you can survive), the farming takes too much time and after a single yield of tomatoes and one yield of three plot's worth of potatoes I just stopped farming, and the information of items and objects is severely lacking. There's no numbers anywhere on cost, sell price, damage, health, nothing. It's all a guessing game. I really cannot stress enough that in a game that advertises itself as a farming game, farming is completely pointless. It's the only means to heal yourself, but the starting tomato yield will be plenty for days on end, and it is impossible to know what the yields will get you or how much money the crops make you, so don't even bother.

Positives:
The monster design is really cool. Incredibly varied and though they're not monsters you haven't seen before it's really fun. The premise is good, though executed with a sloppy hand, and the mix of FPS and tower defense is really great. The dev is clearly creative, and exploring and fighting are the highlights of this game by far.

Summary:
The negatives I've listed are easy fixes, if the dev cares to. The game is PLAYABLE, it just currently sucks to do so. So first and foremost I would do this if I was the dev: quality of life and ease of play (at least early on in new games), including things like: increasing the day time, giving more resources for chest finds, decreasing resource cost for bulk objects such as fences and plots, removing the resource cost for repairing your placed objects, SLOW DOWN your enemies, and reduce the initial spawn count/frequency the first few nights, give us numbers for quantifying HP, damage, and sell costs so we can figure out selling and buying, and fix the hit boxes. Literally just do that and you'll fix this game.",0
27056,I like the concept a lot. The game itself is fun though a little buggy here and there. Honestly could turn into a really awesome solo developed game with a bit more love and time.,1
27057,"In it's current state I really can't recommend buying the game for the cost.
For the first hour or so it's a good time but it just gets repetitive.
The crafting is limited and the hordes seem to be a bit...off. It's not necessarily buggy but the next wave doesn't start until the one before has been completely destroyed and sometimes the monsters seem to get caught in places..which means you get one wave of monsters then..nothing.

After a couple fixes and maybe expanding on some of the basic ideas I think this game could be great-especially as a multiplayer game. Currently...it needs work.",0
27058,"Currently in its state I cannot give it a positive review. the reasons why is the achievements are not working, the first night is pretty hard (but doable), after the third day the merchant has nothing new to sell. Also, I was able 2 defeat the game in 14 days. I won't go into details, but I have to say there is a lot of potential in this game. The only main problem now is the developer needs to get into gear and continue with some updates. It‚Äôs been a while since the game has gotten a update. We shall see if they do.",0
27059,"This action/crafting game gives you a real purpose to your activities ‚Äì you need to build up your defenses (fences, automatic turrets, food to heal you) during the peaceful daytime so that you can survive the alien attacks at night time. You can also swing your ax during the nighttime to try and protect your farm, but the aliens are pretty tough, so it's much more survivable if you have good defenses. 

Note that there's almost no hand-holding so expect to die a lot at first while you figure out what you can do, and what actually helps you survive the onslot at night. A nice change of course from the games that constantly tell you want to do every 10 seconds! There also seems to be a fairly large map to explore, 1 hour in I've only seen a small part of it, and there's definitely loot hidden out there. The game kind of reminds me of a simpler, single player Ark Survival Evolved, but with considerably more utility to crafting structures than in ark, and no boring downtime at night. I do wish the controller support was a bit more robust though. The game is definitely playable without mouse and keyboard, but I did have to do some button remapping (and use steam input to invert Y) before all features were accessible.",1
27060,"-this game has potential
-need co-op mode so i can play with my friends help
-the first night is so hard cuz i don't have anything in the first but enemy is already so much
-need arachnophobia mode (the main reason i don't wanna continue this game)",1
27061,"Okay, so... getting into the game there is no real instructions to follow. I tried to look up instructions on how to play the game didn't really find anything. I can cut trees but no way to mine stones so I couldn't really build anything, and the first night so many monsters came I just kept dying and having to start over. 

Maybe it will improve, but... 
",0
27062,"its a fun little game that i got my money worths out of. its alittle empty, its glitchy, achievments don't work and can get repetitive, but for under $10 (i got it on sale for $4) I got my moneys worth for sure! It does have a great concept, and can be pretty rewarding, but what it's really missing is multiplayer so you can have friends join you. at its current state its a 6.5/10 game but if there was multiplayer it'd be an easy 8",1
27063,"Not recommended in its current state.
The game has potential, sure, but no part of it is fleshed out in any way.

The farming part is bare-bone at best. And there are annoying bugs like targeting farm plots to water if you build them "" too close"" to each other.
Harvesting resources is just tedious.

And the night-time defense sequence isn't working right either. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or progression to the attacks.
It should be easy first nights and then gradually become harder. As far as I can tell, it's the same monsters every night.

The day is too short. You have barely time to chop some wood, and maybe tend to your farm before the night attacks start.

Also, the achievements don't seem to work.",0
27064,I have been waiting for over a month for something as simple as inverting the controls on the mouse.  Can't play the game as it is but now its too late to refund.  Enjoy my money scab.,0
27065,"During the day, you'll find yourself managing and growing your farm, which is a staple of farming sim games. This entails cultivating crops and other aspects like resource management and building. The farming aspects offer a peaceful and relaxing gaming experience, allowing players to create and customize their farms.

However, the twist comes when night falls. As the sun sets, you're thrust into a survival scenario where you must defend your farm and yourself from terrifying creatures. This switch from a laid-back farming simulation to an intense FPS experience as they need to fortify their defenses, upgrade their weapons, and fight off waves of menacing foes.",1
27066,"I have definitely never known the developer or played other of his games, but I got to say this one has been worth the purchase price for me even though I'm on my 1st run through. I generally like base building, tower defense type games like 7DTD, Empyrion, Space Engineers, SmallLand, Conan Exiles, etc.  While this game of course doesn't rise to the level of those, it is better than hundreds of other similar ones in my library.

At first, it's hard to get used to the extremely quick day/night cycle. I don't think its adjustable and really flies by. But I think that is for balance since you could probably gather and craft so much during the day that the mob attacks at night would be too easy otherwise.

The art style of the enemies vary. Probably asset placeholders to be replaced if he continues to enhance the game into the future. 

There are some UI bugs that are easily worked around.

There are a few biomes and a large enough map.

Run speed is very fast, which is nice, so I didn't think there would be fall damage but found out the hard way that there is.

I wish the dev well and will check back soon to see if his design choices and continued efforts can make a real gem.",1
27067,"I love it. The mechanics, game sounds, feelings are all absolutely perfect. It makes a difference with its open world and fine details. I definitely recommend it.",1
27068,Another great game by Applebomb. A mix of farming Sim & fps Survival where you farm and gather resources at the morning and at night you have to survive the monsters attack. THe character and the monsters design are awesome.,1
27069,"It seems fine so far, nothing to special. Like the concept, was 7 bucks. 

However after an hour or two I stopped because pressing esc pauses and instead of exiting the menu, as small as this is it really hinders my flow.",0
27070,"[h1] Awful[/h1]
The day night cycle is too short, with no way to change it. 
Just a game of speed.
No substance.
A money grab.
Stay away.
Nothing else to say.",0
27071,"So I have t played long, just 4 nights in, but there is ONE fatal flaw I can already see: daytime length. At first your biggest priority would be getting a weapon/sentry turret, and then you can focus more on farming and gathering resources; however, and this is especially true as nights progress, daytime is so incredibly short that you will oftentimes be unable to even gather enough resources to craft new defenses or maintain the ones you have. This is compounded by monsters getting exponentially tougher as nights go on. It basically puts a hard cap to how far you can survive because eventually you'll hit a resource deficit if you slip up on your progress even slightly. 

The game itself is fun for what it's worth, it's a decent little defensive survival craft. I would definitely continue playing it, it's pretty fun mechanically and combat wise - and the laid back theme is pretty relaxing. That crippling daytime length though is the biggest, most blatant issue with the game thus far.",1
27072,"03/12/2024 - Update! Game is abandoned. Unfinished, unpolished, imbalanced, and no word from the developers in eons. Very sad.

Original review below:


This is a VERY RELUCTANT recommend.

Things about this game that genuinely angered me:

1: Hitting ESC to open the menu CANNOT be used to close the menu. You have to use your mouse to click on resume.

2: Pinpoint precision. Hitting trees, hitting rocks, if you hit the button to swing even 1 inch off of it, and 99% of the animation hits the rock, or tree, it results in an empty swing. Very annoying.

3: Watering plants is annoying. Not because it's a chore, but it's also a PINPOINT accuracy type of thing. You can sit there staring at the plant with your water draining out, and not give the plant a single ounce of liquid unless you are precisely on the right spot, which can take a couple tries to even find.

4: Turrets. They're awesome, but they steal your kills. Normally, killing an enemy with your weapon gives you money, but your turret kills do not give you a dime.

5: PACING - I had to replay the first day about 9 times till it felt like I was mastering a speed run because of how short the days are before the nightly wave.

My speedrun tactic for surviving THE FIRST DAY is as follows:

SPRINT to the box in front of the barn, SPRINT behind the barn for the chest, then SPRINT to the nearest clump of trees, and chop down as many as humanly possible in the shortest amount of time so you can afford the pickaxe, if you can find the trader in time, sell ALL of your wood to buy the pickaxe, and start over with SPRINTING to trees and rocks till you have enough for about three turrets. 

6: Merchant. Having money isn't enough. You need to harvest resources ALONG with having money in order to buy most things. This is really annoying because you don't go to Ace Hardware with clumps of iron ore and logs in order to buy tools. It just doesn't make any sense considering the merchant is just aimlessly wandering around, and has no way to actually use these items to make the things that are being sold, which would make sense.

7: ... Actually, I'll just cut it off at 7. This game is clearly a labor of love, and hopefully these tip of the iceberg issues get solved someday.

Things about this game I genuinely enjoyed:

1: Building! It's fun to put fences around, fun to place crops, and it's fun to place turrets, and not to focus on the negatives, but beware when building too close to your barn, as there are no hit detection for the walls. Enemies can go inside the barn and absolutely devastate anything built too close on the other side.

2: Exploration. Despite not really being given more than a couple minutes of daylight to RUSH to grab resources like it's a speedrun on day 1, it is kinda fun to go into a cave and find some rare minerals to sell.

3: The concept is genuinely fun. You're a farmer, you've got a farm, and you're trying to grow stuff, but enemies come at night. It's a cool idea, a cool concept, but the quality of life just isn't there yet.

I genuinely think this game could someday develop into a really cool game, but as it stands now, it's just not there. I want this game to succeed, and I want updates to get them there, thus the positive review, but again, it comes very reluctantly.",0
27073,"Getting lost in the open world of the game. A large, lively and beautiful game. successful in style. I liked it very much",1
27074,"Relaxing and intense with some nice graphics and world! My favorite is fishing, I haven't played a game with FPS fishing mechanics before and this was fun!!",1
27075,"You want a farming sim game? we got you!
You also want some fps survival? we got you!
You also want some tower def mechanic? we got you!!!",1
27076,"All of the positive reviews are fake, don't believe their lies.

Some of the reviewers are friends with each other and some of them only review games from this 1 developer, 1 of the reviewers names is even Keaton which is the name of the developer and all 4 of his reviews are for his own games.

The developer edited his response, here is the original: https://i.imgur.com/vz74SeH.png

Also he removed his name from his account that he reviews his own games with.",0
27077,"I like exploring the world and going in different caves to see what I can find. There seems to be a good amount of content in the world here, and I like how it's sort of casual and not hard to play since I am not a hardcore gamer.",1
27078,"Another amazing game by AppleBomb Games. You can farm fruits & vegtibles, go fishing, explore huge map with many caves,  build turrets for defense against monsters who will hunt you down during the night time.
I already enjoyed their last game Animalistic which was crazy as well!",1

27089,"This game is still in early access so its incomplete with many mechanics obviously lacking content that will later be added, and will hopefully get better. 

For now though, I'd say this game is pretty good

Pros:
The character models are nice looking and pretty sexy looking. the fact that every female character also has large tits is very appreciated.
The animation is also very good. seeing a characters assets swing about as they move is a lovely detail.
Can be played with one hand
Story is promising. an adopted son building a drug empire to avenge his adoptive father and protect his family, whilst darker forces move in, is very promising.
Characters are mostly one note but still nice to be around. there's no point in the game where i've been forced to interact with a character i didn't like.
I encountered no major bugs in my first play through.

Cons: 
levelling up is boring. you do get exp from doing missions but the bulk of your levelling comes from doing the same shooing range mini game over and over again, and if you want to get to max level your going to have to shoot a lot of targets.
The mechanical difficulty isn't difficult. the character creator makes it sound like the different choices will make your run easier or harder, but really it only makes the game longer or shorter. despite technically being at war with all the surrounding cartels, they never actually attack your home so you can just sit at home selling weed till you can steamroll the first city. from there its just grinding levels.
Lack of choices, maybe more will be added over time but at the moment there are very few choices your character can make, meaning most of the time you're just watching events play out with no influence on those events.

I hope development will be kind to this game since there is a lot of potential. so here's what i would like to see.
One, add some fluff choices. the choices that do exist seem to have actual meaning (or at least they eventually will as development progresses) which is good, but having some extra fluff choices to allow a player to personalise their play through, even if those choices have no wider effect on the story would be nice.
Secondly some more cartel management content. maybe other cities unlock further in the game, but at this point, having taken over, fully upgraded, fully garrisoned the first city I can't attack the second city. so I'm just sitting around banking millions of dollars and stockpiling guns just in case.
so either more things to attack, or even random events. like ""oh hey your base in under attack by a rival cartel. do you have 50 spare guns or 20 spare men to fend them off, or else you'll lose a lot of money.""
or
""one of our men betrayed us! are we gonna gun him down or are we gonna spend some cash to reward the loyal ones?""

Two, their needs to be more risk. you're in a war with cartels and yet i feel like I'm playing against the easy mode AI in an RTS, they kind of just sit there and let me attack them piece by piece, and i can replace my garrisons way faster then the enemy can deplete them. if there was an auto garrison button, i'd hardly notice the attacks on my businesses. I think if you had to keep some men sitting around home to defend against enemy attacks or your family members might be kidnapped or you get killed, that would be good. Implement mechanics that if managed poorly kill me, but if managed well, reward me. that would be nice

Third, more stuff to do with your money would be nice, as this game gets developed more stuff will be added of course, but being able to bribe officers to look the other way, or bribe the mayor to harass other cartels preventing them from attacking me, or hand out loans to businesses for future profit, would be nice.

Four, and I know this has nothing to do with the game itself, but as the game gets developed in early access, slowly increase the price of the game as it gets more content. that way people can't just buy the game before it comes out, wait a month or two, then get the full game for a fraction of the price.",1
27090,"This game is being released in Early Access. That means that the game may, or may not, change from its current state.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Cartel Simulator is a RenPy visual novel with a heavy management lean.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Your adoptive mother, Sophia Hernandez, was the leader of a cartel. She adopted you because she didn't have a male heir. Sophia has stepped back from the running the cartel, and your family moved. However, news has reached Sophia that your lives are in danger from the other cartels. You decide it is time for you to get involved in the family business.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
There is a short introduction to the game and then you set your first name. Your last name is Hernandez and cannot be changed. Next you pick your difficulty level. Each has its pros and cons. Next you pick the flag for your Cartel and set the name of the Cartel. Next you select your best friend, one of the four female main characters.

The first year introduces you to the backstory of the game and takes a half hour to 45 minutes to get through. After that the game is very much grindy. There are quests, but you need to make a lot of money to complete most of them, $1,000,000. Once you get the club you're making $25K a day, so that is 40 days to make the money. Then you can sell weed, but that is less than $15K a day. It wasn't until late in the game I found how to access the other cities, the map button in the upper left of the map, so this could probably be sped up by taking over businesses in another city. That's the funny thing, some things are blocked until you start taking over businesses in another city and the map starts on your starting city of Teruca. I only found the other cities by accident.

You can go to the shooting range to gain experience. It costs $150 to go to the shooting range. As far as I could see, as long as you have more than that you can use the shooting range, but the money isn't deducted. Targets pop up and shoot at you approximately every two seconds that they are up. Once your health is gone the session is over. I spent a lot of time trying to actually shoot the targets as they pop, then I found out that you only have to press the mouse button and you will hit the target. So, place your cursor on the line under the bullets, to the left of the word bullets and click when a target pops up. Then when you are out of bullets you are on top of the reload button.

I can't tell you how leveling works exactly. You click on the gun in your hide out to access the leveling screen. Your main way to gain experience, at least early on, is the shooting range. However, you can't gain multiple levels at a time. So, there is no point getting a massive score at the shooting range. However, I was level 14 and the stat screen showed that I needed 1000 XP, that works out to 4,000 points at the range. So, I got my 4,000 points, but no level up message. So, I went dancing to get some XP, I got 4 whole points. Now the stat bar is showing 1004 / 1000, but still no level up message. Bottom line, the status bar is not an accurate indicator of the experience you need for the next level.

The developer has released one update since release. Since the game has only been out for a month it isn't clear if that is the continue plan. Some of the story lines have ""End of current content"" messages, others do not. The developer has stated that they plan on updates approximately every two months.

Most of the achievements depend on your choices, in certain situations. Theoretically, you could get all of the achievements on one playthrough, using save slots and selecting all of the options after reloading.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery. Some of the scenes are easily repeatable, others are a one-time thing. So you can use save slots to replay the scenes you like.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A decent game, with okay art. There is a lot of room for improvement. As this is Early Access those improvements may, or may not, arrive. Updates are planned every other month.

27091,"This game still needs a lot more time to cook.

While certain routes are complete for the most part. There is still a large amount of content missing.

The scenes are stil fixed animations that you cannot interact with but just choose which one you want.

Also no gallery is in the game for the scenes, so you manually have to save them or hope they're still repeatable through interactions. Some scenes are one and done so it sucks.

Additionally, if I have to compare the story/plot of this game to their last game they made. I would say ""Never Meet Your Heroes"" had a better plot because it was more wild and fun. The plot in Cartel Simulator feels like discounted John Wick, if John Wick was a short man.

I hope this Dev and his team at ITK keep improving. I can see their work is slowly becoming more optimized. However, right now it still needs a lot of work.",0
27092,I Had a Thumbs up but had to change it do to the developer starting a new game before finishing this one first. Its not like ITK can handle two games so they should not have started the 2nd one! I hope others change their thumbs up to a thumbs down for this too!,0

The story really pulls you in and I think that its an excellent starting point. I personally feel like the dev should push the morality envelope a little more. Some of the choices seem similar. The combat is a cool add-on and there is definitely a lot of room to expand on it. For what it is right now I want to say it is a solid contender for adult gaming in general. I really hope you get some momentum on this game because it has something special. I look forward to updating this review as the updates come out.",1
27095,"Game had potential but looks like devs have abandoned it, unfinished, promised a new chapter but never delivered. I don't recommend buying the game what a shame really wtf are you guys doing? At least wrap this up with an end or i'll never buy from you guys again.",0
27096,"‚úÖThe Good:
+ The Quality is Good | 7.5/10
+ The Women look Good | 7.5/10
+ Sex Scenes are Good | 7/10
+ For a Visual Novel it has nice rpg elements althow some seem not to be working
+ It has nice videos with Voice Acting
+ It has Good looking interface and theme
+ It has decent soundtrack

‚ùåThe Bad:
- No Auto forward text feature
- Few Sex Scenes so far
- It does not have gallery
- The Story is goodish
- One thing that needs to be fixed in my opinion is when adding ""soldiers"", weapons and vehicles, we should be able to add more than one per click.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3100586154 

Scoreüíô: 6.9/10

In respect to rpg elements and having a good rpg game it has a lot to improve, as a visual novel i think it is in a good path, women are hot, sex scenes are good but few story is goodish.

This is just some pictures and text.... .click click click!!! thats it.
There is no REAL game....  in fact

I can find games on google like this that are FREE and look even better.
I am not one that is normally so negative about a game like this but; HOW DARE YOU ask money for this.
I can make something better then this and even opt in more animations, quality and more and more realistic adult RP.
Seriously.... 

DO NOT  BUY THIS!!! its a WASTE of your money

27098,I want to say that this game is not bad for visual but well idk really why you guys should start a new game while this one is incomplete. For that reason I will give it a dislike.Maybe if it get updated I will change my mind.,0

27102,Had potential...some visual were good some are not so good. It played well...and then the dev went incommunicado after promising a new update in May...that promise came in April and this guy has been radio silent ever since. Hard pass this one,0
27103,"Pros: 
-interesting story
-sometimes the graphics are good
-Developers are still working on the game 
-Lilas last story line was peak (hopefully more to her story)
-High Table adds depth to the story 
 
Cons
-there is no character voices all the time so you have to read unless you use text to speech
-you there are some points where the story does not match with what was said
-there is not a lot of decisions the MC can make, you take a passive role as the story progresses 
-when you pass certain checkpoints with certain characters there is rarely interactions with them (no clue why i need to build up so much trust) 
-Sometimes very grind focused, partially my fault because i picked commander so vehicles are 100k a pop, i played an allied with italians but i havent seen any benefit as to choose them (i think the devs are working on that) and chose weed instead of cocaine or meth or soldier camp. I have not ran the game back choosing a different best friend or alliance or warehouse so i don't know if the story changes from best friends and if i can make more money from a different warehouse or alliance.

Character info:
-Level 30 (Max Level) (You need 1000 xp a level but i think thats glitched cause sometimes i need like 3000 at around level 25)
-Best friend: Lila (if you play the game its obvious) (i dont know what the best friend does to the story though
-Soldiers: 3200 (it gets to a point where i pay $3+ mil a week in salary)
-vehicles: 970
-Weapons: 3200 
*i can increase these numbers in soldiers vehicles and weapons but the soldiers are a weekly pay (vehicles and weapons are a one time payment) so there will be a point where i will have to grind the warehouse constantly to maintain soldiers salary (90 secs = $5 mil=1 day in game)

Thoughts: 
I believe people are deterred from this game because of the nudity and scenes but i think if you can get past that you can enjoy this game for what it is, a good story and concept i think more developers and game creators should make good games that also have that element. This game is only $10 and i do not regret buying it. If you read this post all the way through from the date i posted buy the game if you read it months later and the devs have increased the story buy it. We gotta support game creators that are adding and paving a way to different styles of games. You can also give ideas to the dev to improve the game.",1
27104,"Excellent game with tons of potential, I love the writing in general. The dialogue between the family members should be as a normal family would, with some morality, but as we know it changes eventually. But solid. Amazing work, can't wait to see more, excited for the devs.",1

27107,"As the game is in the early stage this is a great starting.. let's start with the render quality first, it's... GREAT, I was amazed to know that the renders are made on the VAM, not Daz or anything. The skin tones and lighting are overall good...I don't like Sophia's smile though. Now, it comes to the animation well tbh it's good I would say, yup there are some improvements needed especially on body parts jiggling during lewd scenes. But it's overall very fluid. Ooh, one thing I loved most, is the small details like the timeline transaction animations, those cars moving to another city before the battle. Next, is the Story which is very crucial for all games, and tbh its overall good, you will get the vibe like some vintage feelings, I love it. Coming to the UI, it looks great, especially the menu icons I love it most. Before conclusion, i wanna say that as the game is a sandbox game so there will be grinding.

27108,"The game is clearly in early access. There are obviously several stories and features lacking at the moment, and some minor bugs here and there to iron out. That being said, what has been present so far is well written, and both the still frames and animations look great. It's clear that much effort was dedicated to making those work - there are no graphical glitches, and the only thing that might bug some people is that the movements don't perfectly loop indefinitely. You will notice a stutter before things reposition to start the animation cycle again. The game cycle for some tasks is repetitive, but once more features are added, the greater variety of ways to do things should help reduce the monotony of something like going to the shooting range to level up because it's the only reliable way of large amounts of exp. Overall, a pretty solid game that just needs more content to be added.",1

27116,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW

Compared to the first release of this developer (Never Meet Your Heroes), this one is an improvement in every aspect, especially the scenes which are way better, but also longer (Not always a 3-second loop animation). It's easy enough to understand and not grindy when you need money. I applaud the developers for not making a copy-paste like others often do.

Now for the negative... I usually read everything, but I felt the story in this one was just dragging on and on (Which I felt the same for Never Meet Your Heroes). Too much text with barely any scenes. I'm pretty sure I did everything that was offered in this version, and I only got like 5 scenes. Now, like I said this is still early access, but I felt there was something missing.

Again, this might change with future updates but right now, the game is worth it, and I'm looking forward for what's next !",1

27127,"It's ok. The topic and approach is innovative and interesting; especially for a game using the Ren'Py visual novel engine.

I wouldn't say you ""navigate"" the drug trade though. There's really only one main path the protagonist is obliged to follow. As you'd expect, there's lot of indiscriminate murder and mayhem. More problematic is the railroaded plot - as you can't spare some people (such as the schoolgirl you are obliged to murder) whilst you are forced to intervene and spare others (a certain highschool crush) despite the implied risk.

There's some content and obviously a lot of potential; but when the Early Access content runs out, there's no indication in the game that this has happened - so you'll be spinning your wheels for a couple of weeks of in-game turns before realising you've actually run out of road.

Tentative recommend for people that don't mind a janky user interface overhaul of Ren'Py and playing as a bad guy (not a ""good"" bad-guy; an actual bad bad-guy).",1

27140,"Being a fan of David's work (particularly Chop Goblins), I decided to buy this game!

It's a cool little title where you navigate through a dark factory, killing mutated unicorn/human hybrids with your pistol.

The pistol shoots faster the longer you hold the trigger, which is a satisfying mechanic that I can't recall seeing in any other games. That being said, this is (obviously) not a high-speed boomer shooter where you're constantly fragging enemies and hopping around like Gordon Freeman. It's slower, and has a stronger focus on presentation/atmosphere than gameplay. No running, and no jumping. Just shooting and a small story told by pages found throughout.

It must be stated that this game is [i]extremely[/i] short, clocking in at about 33 minutes. The asking price is pretty inoffensive (especially for an indie), but it should definitely be considered before purchase. There are also a few modes to help with replayability, though I think you'd have to be a specific type to run through the game multiple times as it's very linear.

If you're okay with spending a few dollars for a half-hour experience w/ optional replay modes for challenge (with the added bonus of supporting an indie dev), then, [b]yes, I recommend this game[/b]. Ideally, a title this short would be free, but I understand game development is *not* free.",1
27141,"I don't know how David Szymanski keeps managing to make games based exactly on whatever genre or niche I thought ""Wow, I wish someone would make something like this again."" about.
I play Quake and Blood, he makes DUSK. I play Doom 3, he makes The Pony Factory, I play Manhunt & Condemned, he's making that now. It's getting weird. Stop looking at my Recently Played for inspiration.

Anyways, this is a short half hour long horror game where you can't have a flashlight and your gun out at the same time. No duct tape mod to be found. You need to scan your surroundings quickly to check what's out there, then fire at where it might be. Muzzle flash also lights things up, but ammo is a limited resource. I had good fun with it, and I'll probably play it again on one of the challenge modes in the future. This release also includes some goodies and the soundtrack in the files. Lovely little treat.",1
27142,"David Szymanski is my favorite solo game dev, his games have a simple charm and he often takes really simple but clever concepts and turns them into surprisingly fantastic games.

However I don't think this game should have gotten it's own standalone release, it's simply not that great compared to his other works. It was originally part of Dread X and made in only 7 days, and even with the remaster this version honestly still feels like that. It just doesn't do anything that other games don't do better, even some of David's own games.

If this game looks interesting to you, I'd honestly recommend just buying Dusk instead, by the same developer. It's a very similar concept but much more fleshed out and fun. 

I still won't be refunding it because I love David and want to support his future works, but I don't think I can recommend this game for any other reasons than that.",0
27143,"""A rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice

27144,A brilliant and striking narrative about how corporate greed will twist and rend any wholesome dream into a hellish nightmare... I think...,1
27145,"Another great one from this dev. Frankly juggling between being able to See and being able to Shoot is probably some of the most fun I've had in a while with a shooter. It makes the game so much more tense and it forces you to think more about how you're using the tools given to you. Do I take out my flashlight to get a better look, and risk getting myself killed in the second it takes to switch back to the gun? Or, do I use the gun as my light, and risk wasting bullets, in the hopes that I might hit something that I can't see yet?

The atmosphere is great. The crisp black shadows make it difficult to parse things, but not in a fuzzy, annoying way. The noises, especially the ponies, are horrifying in the best way, not to mention those noises being another way of keeping yourself safe: Even if you can't see them, you can still Hear them.

The story itself is so silly it wraps back around to being genius, IMO. I feel like with a lot of horror you get a lot of ultra serious stuff, and a lot of stuff that's Trying to be serious but falls flat. This is not that. This is a game where you can pick up a note and read that Fred Flintstone is a canonical character in this universe and is, indirectly, partially culpable for the forced physical transformations of an entire town into gross, flayed, magical ponies. I like that a lot.

Obviously its a short game, and the AI wasn't the best (I got a lot of cheap kills that I probably shouldn't have gotten, LOL), but even despite that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I'll likely play it again to show my friends. My only critique is I wish you got an achievement for jumping in The Precarious Death Pit, but hey, you can't win em all.",1
27146,"This game is amazing, it really brings out the human instinct of fear of the undead four legged creatures commonly found on planet Earth. This game puts you in a really immersive mindset of something like a Chicago police officer handling violent animals by calmly diffusing the situation with an entire mag to their body. My only critique of the game is there is not nearly enough precarious death pits to make the game feel well rounded and realistic to the world within the game. Overall this game is a 10/10 experience and I would recommend it to those who enjoy brutally murdering animals with advanced killing machines.",1
27147,"Better than what the trailer presents, and I love that cheesy music score. It's perfect.
Great game. Exceeded expectations.

Also it made me yell out loud once.",1
27148,"Typically love these types of PSX indie horror games and David Szymanski has a pretty good library, but this isn't great. Story was going for silly and it fell flat; music was nothing but a theremin making alien noises; enemy variety was lacking; and the gameplay was walking down a hallway and then back again. 

Not great. Not even really worth the small price.",0
27149,"This is what I imagined a kidnapper's basement looked like when I was a child, and the trials and tribulations I'd have to go through to escape. If you're off-put by the idea of killing magic ponies, don't worry, they're not very nice. In fact, I'd go as far as to call them mean.

Buy this game for the atmosphere, not the combat; it doesn't excel in PvE. Enemies can get stuck on walls, which isn't great for immersion or tension. Being forced to hold either your weapon or flashlight was effective in making me feel the littlest bit more vulnerable than the dark closed-in setting already did. It's a simple gimmick that works as intended, but isn't fleshed out by any notable design. I personally loved the grim, noir lighting and sparse glowing windows and lights. Keep in mind that the main game can be completed in around 30 minutes.",1
27150,Only Szymanski could come up with a game in which you have to shoot your way through a factory for My Little Ponys from hell. Genuinely spooky as well and can be beaten in one session,1
27151,"Even though the limitations are visible that this was made for the 7DFPS game jam with the limited enemy variety, repeating backgrounds, and storytelling relegated to mainly documents, it's the pacing, gameplay, and scares that are still effective. Having to walk around with a flashlight because the environments are nearly pitch dark black-and-white, but if you spot an enemy, you have to switch to your bolt gun to put down these magical hellish ponies and you're basically spraying and praying. The bipedal ponies that hit you with a mage-like attack make it easier to spot them in the dark but you'll have only that millisecond to aim at them. The shooting feels good, and the enemies gib well as expected for a David Szymanski game. It's quite an inspired setting, mixing religious horror with a meat plant and turning humans into ponies so they sin less to the point where sinning is calculated. The saves are for each level, so if you die, you have to repeat the whole level which are usually a few minutes long but because it's so effectively scary (got jump scared a handful of times), I would be relieved after each level. You can shine a light on a pony, and they won't notice you, so you can strategise when to move and shoot in the dark. Once you complete the main objective, you're escaping all the way back those levels, and even on normal difficulty, you will definitely want to use all the health kits and ammo pickups. Colour gets introduced in this latter half to moody effect, and the story has a great final twist about your character. For less than 2 hours long, finally using the Doom 3 gimmick to good effect, and this price point, it's an easy recommend.",1
27152,"Short, sweet, simplistic and to the point! The Pony Factory, by the devs that brought us ""Dusk"", comes this cool Horror FPS. A full playthrough will take about 25-35 minutes. It reminds me just a bit of the first-half of RE7, and I love that kind of vibe. Recommended!",1

27156,"Dude, what if Doom 3 was a real game? Played for about 30 minutes, breezed through a standard playthrough and got halfway through Iron Horse before I decided I'd had enough. It should be the default mode, if I'm being honest.

Extremely light on plot, but very good at setting an atmosphere. Never really felt like I was being screwed by an enemy where I couldn't believably be expected to find them.

Very fun way to end the game as well. Only flaw I could say is that the game is far too easy, especially for a standard playthrough. I suspect that this is because the game was made in under a week, which probably also doubles as a reason for the short length of the game. Regardless, someone could probably turn this into a real, full-fledged game.

As it stands right now, it's a fun game for 30 minutes, and then it's done.",1

27158,"I'm frustrated.

David Szymanski was my favorite author -- because each of his games was packed with deep story, neat idea, interesting approach, vivid and original gameplay design -- except DUSK, which was just a dynamic shooter and I enjoyed playing it (don't know anything about Gloomworld, didn't have a chance). I was perplexed during the release of ‚ÄúChop Goblins‚Äù, because it looked like a sale of unused maps from DUSK, absurdly crammed into one game (thanks to time and space travel, that game has a modern city, Rome, Dracula's castle, and even another universe), but I didn't judge it harshly, even when David confessed that he releases games for the sake of making money, not for the sake of the idea.

However, having gone through this one it's impossible to keep silent anymore: this game is made for the sales. It has no idea, no interesting gameplay (excluding black-and-white darkness & flashlight/weapon-modes combo), or exciting gamedesign. You just walk along the same type of corridors and shoot at the same type of nuns. Periodically you pick up health kits and ammo, or try not to step on electricity. 

Don't get me wrong: the game is done very well, and it's quite enjoyable to play. But I was expecting what David had always done: a mind-blowing pearl; this is just basic storyless slightly creepy indie-shooter. To lengthen the process of the game (after all, the game can be completed in 40 minutes without rushing), the whole second half of it is made of the same maps you already gone through, but in reverse (you ""get into the factory and get out of the factory""). 

And I probably wouldn't even leave a negative review if the game was two-three times cheaper, but 5$ (Finland) for unreasonable expectations for 40 minutes -- that's too much. :(

I'm frustrated. I know David can do much better. Hopefully, he'll show up brighter in the next games -- just like he did in the ""Iron lung"", ""The music machine"", ""The moon silver"", ""A wolf in autumn"" and ""Fingerbones"".",0
27159,"I love Szymanski, but there is pretty much zero story and zero build-up or variety. It would be pretty good if it was free but it's not. It seemed like all the effort went into the level design which was really good. I love the atmosphere except for one music track which is pretty goofy but its only scary for the first 5 seconds. And when text pops up on the screen telling the player how to do stuff instead of the game design showing you in subtle ways take me out of the immersion. I love all of David's other stuff tho, very talented game developer.",0

27161,"This is definitely NOT an episode of your dad's My Little Pony! This is a dark, nightmare fueled pony corral and I love it! I am a big fan of fun, quirky horror games and this game is very much that! The action is fun, the story is goofy and interesting and the enemies are fun. The jumpscares are good and not overly done imo. Just enough to keep you on edge and keep it fun! Overall I really enjoyed my playthrough! Definitely worth the $4 price tag!",1

[b]...but magic is heresy[/b]
Bearing a title hinting at the right kind of dark humour, The Pony Factory has hit the Steam‚Äôs proverbial shelves at the beginning of 2024. Created by David Szymanski, the mind behind Dusk and Iron Lung, follows the trend of more recent, short entries by the developer. The game is a bite-sized piece of survival horror, meant to be finished within a single sitting as it takes under an hour to complete. To give credit where it is due, dimly-lit corridors of the factory carry a spark of ingenious design which made David Szymanski a household name among indie fans. However, The Pony Factory is not what you might expect it to be and for multiple reasons, we will get to these.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3320219700[/url]
[b]Long-range tactical husbandry needs[/b]
As a toothy grin of an equine skull peering at the player from the main menu may indicate, the titular Ponies are less than wholesome creatures. Similarly welcoming is the industrial interior of the factory, both desolate and shrouded in monochromatic darkness. Despite a sardonic spin on the horror genre, the game efficiently establishes oppressive atmosphere, once tormented wailing of [i]a pony[/i] begins to echo throughout the narrow corridors.

To stave off the encroaching darkness, the player is provided with an Automatic Bolt Gun, capable of delivering 40 rounds of industrial-grade pony-processing firepower. Neatly showcasing simple yet smart design ‚Äì muzzle flash of the weapon is the primary source of illumination during the early levels of the game.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3320219957[/url]
Another aspect of the game more than worthy of a separate mention is how The Pony Factory utilizes its ever-present notes. Admittedly, random pieces of paper plastered all around the place, are something of an indie horror staple of narrative exposition. What elevates the notes in this title is the corporate language they are filled with. Full to the brim with absurd euphemisms, they add a distinct humouristic quality to what often is utterly underwhelming part of the game.

[b]The other side of the coin[/b]
Truth be told, while there is a couple of fun details I‚Äôve left uncovered, delving any further into a 40-odd minute title would approach writing its novelization. Instead, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room, as I would imagine even David Szymanski fans (who I believe to be the only target audience of this obscure game) may end up disappointed upon approaching The Pony Factory blindly.

To begin with, this isn‚Äôt the first time this game was made available for distribution. Original version was created as a part of the first Dread X Collection. More importantly, Dread X entries are created in a game jam format. In this particular case, the game was supposed to be completed within a week. While impressive [i]given the circumstances[/i], understandably concessions in terms of quality and complexity had to be made.

[b]Toss a coin to your dev[/b]
All things considered, The Pony Factory is a mixed bag in my book. To be fair, it does deliver a fun and intense experience, however only once the circumstances of the game‚Äôs conception are known, does it become any impressive. Should you happen to come across this game blindly, it is likely to end bafflingly quick. Furthermore, while the price tag is symbolic, Chop Goblins ‚Äì the actual newest game by David Szymanski at the time of writing, offers a lot more content and polish. Ultimately, purchase of The Pony Factory boils down to whether you would like to toss a coin in direction of your favourite indie dev or not. I will leave the matter at your discretion, but should you lean towards ‚Äúno‚Äù you are probably better off giving The Dread X Collection a go instead.",1
27167,It's great! A definitive and worthy improvement over the previous Dread X Collection version. The gameplay is intense and dramatic thanks to the hard-hitting enemies and the flashlight mechanic.,1
27168,"in the factpry. straight up ""makeing it"". and by ""it"", haha, well. let's just say. My ponies",1
27169,"An ok game that I originally played on the Dread X Collection and now as a standalone but the one thing I didn't like was not being able to see what I am shooting at since you need to constantly switch between flashlight and your gun to see where the magical ponies are. Other than that its an ok game that looks good but it is short and I beat in under an hour

27170,"Truthfully for such a simplistic game I really think it does horror very well! Which at this point you can just always expect from David Szymanski! The sound and monster design are amazing, even something as simple as the lighting effects really compliment how creepy the whole game is, despite the plot being used to very hilarious effect. For being such a short game it is very effective to everything it set out to do.",1
27171,"I feel a bit disappointed as it feel like one of the weaker games of David Szymanski, the level design and the visuals are pretty nice but the rest feel a bit lackluster. It's probably me but I was probably expecting something more that I could feel on other productions such as Chop Goblins or Squirrel Stapler. Clearly not a bad experience but I would recommend checking the other games out before taking this one",0
27172,"Very short game, but I did enjoy the style and gameplay. Interesting having to decide between being able to see and being able to protect yourself. 

Very much what Doom 3 was trying and failing to do. 

I did get into the routine of clearing areas carefully as health pick-ups are uncommon. The ranged attacks are annoying as you need something in between otherwise they are so fast that you won't be able to dodge. 

The story is told through A4 bits of paper scattered throughout the levels.

27173,"terrible working conditions terrible pay and a 9/5 what could possibly be any worse 
oh yeah the demonic pony's how could i forget",1
27174,"Great game. I love the use of darkness, plus the shoot/flashlight switching mechanic. It's a very creative story and monster(s). My only complaint is the extremely high look sensitivity but I'm glad you can change it in settings. Another great entry by one of my favorite indie developers.",1
27175,"One of my favorites of Szymanski's short games. I consider myself fairly desensitized to horror these days, but this one really gets under my skin. It makes you feel like an urban explorer, walking down the decrepit factory halls full of rusty machines and sharp turns. It features a b&w aesthetic with some great use of baked lighting, has a basic combat system with some light resource management, and lots of terrifying encounters. There's a beauty in it's simplicity.",1
27176,"Really cool game with a neat premise. It's obviously limited in length and scope, but a great experience nonetheless. Despite some corniness and really silly references in the notes (like Fred Flintstone being a character), the atmosphere and pacing is spot on. It is legitimately tense walking around not knowing when monsters will appear, and it's startling when they do most of the time. It takes the original concept of Doom 3's flashlight, where you have to balance shooting and being able to see, and it makes a lot of encounters really interesting, despite only fighting the same two enemies over and over.

 To me the length is perfect, and there are extra modes to shake up the gameplay if you feel like going through it again. The only real criticism I have is the final boss is incredibly simple and not very interesting design-wise, but that hardly detracts from the overall experience. All in all a great short experience.",1
27177,"I completed this in under an hour, and I thought it was pretty fun! It starts off fairly tense in dark areas, but actually turns into a very fun dungeon crawler as the uncolorful hell light opens up these arenas to shoot hellspawn in. 

0/10 made me a brony.",1
27178,"If you like David Szymanski's other games, you will probably like this too. Even though it was quite short (38 minutes), I still think it is worth the money, because it is a fun little horror game that managed to scare me quite a couple times and had a pretty good atmosphere. Another thing this game did great is limit your weapon and flashlight usage, you can only have one out at a time. Music is pretty good too as expected.

My only real complaint is that the sensitivity slider is not very good if you play on lower sensitivies, not that it is a big deal considering the length of the game.",1
27179,"Looking at this from a design perspective is fun. Designing levels that are playable from both ends, experimenting with lighting in interesting ways and taking elements from older Dooms (mostly the third one), implementing them into this killer atmosphere and adding a freaky story to the equation must've been fun creatively. But the end product doesn't offer the same element of fun from that process. For example, after finishing the game I really didn't want to check out the remaning difficulties and modes because I simply guessed that it wouldn't be too fun. However, like I mentioned, this has a killer atmosphere and delightful enemy designs (as expected from the person who also made Squirrel Stapler). I genuinely felt scared at certain segments and not many games can do that, for that and because of the reasonable price point I give this a recommendation. Just don't expect much.",1
27180,"Love this game. The 50's aesthetic is great, gives a unique feeling. It has a few extra difficulty modes which gives more replayability.",1
27181,A highly polished and interesting horror shooter. As expected by legendary indie developer David Szymanski. Short but sweet.,1
27182,"This is "" Umm actually you not being able to hold a flashlight and a gun at the same time in Doom 3 was a good mechanic and enhanced the horror""- the game. So much so that the all of the core mechanics of the game are centered around this idea. You switch between your flashlight and the only gun you have in this game with your right click, so you can try to shoot down skeleton pony that is running toward in complete darkness as fast as possible. 
It's incredible how much this one simple mechanic has enhanced the horror. You can use flashlight to light up the area and see the enemies, but you can't shoot them. If you switch to your gun, you can only see the enemies through either A) the ambient light of the level B) the light of the enemies's projectiles as it being hurled at you or C) the flash muzzle of your gun as you frantically shoot at them. It gets to the point that you would see a well lit area and you start to get scared because you know this going to be the place where flashlight is of no use. 
Speaking of gun, you basically have this wacky SMG/Nail gun as your only weapon in this game. That's right, there is no shotgun, no pistol, no BFG, only this weird as SMG that has a lot of recoil. This gun also increases the horror element due to its inaccuracy. So if the enemy is sniping you from far or is behind a cover, your gun might not be able to get it. You have to let the enemy get close to you, so all your bullets can hit him, but in that case, your chances of getting hit increases. 
The game is dead simple. The levels are you going from one door to another door while navigating a bunch of hallways, corridors, and big rooms. All the while, these enemies that are basically the Wendigos from David Szymanski's other joint, Dusk, and their hybrid with Dusk's other enemies, mages, will try to kill you. The level design is straightforward and linear so much so it kinda reminded me of Half Life. One of my friends always hated FPS games for how linear they are, and this game reminded me of that friend. However, this game uses its linearity to its advantage (and later on when you have to backtrack those levels). Because the goal of the game is to create a simple mood piece and atmosphere, not to create the next big thing. You go from one room to another hallway, killing zombie ponies, and hoping to god that you have enough ammo and health left behind in the previous rooms to survive this level.
Speaking of god, I kinda didn't care for the story of this game. I don't want to spoil anything. However, you going to have lot of fun if you consider this game as a criticism on the brony fandom (I'm not saying this as a joke, there is some truly sick and twisted individuals in that fandom). Otherwise, this is yet another ""Religion is Bad"" video game. I am an atheist and even I am getting tired of these types of stories. I personally love Dusk and its story, which is another this type of story trope that I mentioned. However, Dusk was very minimalist in its approach. Meanwhile, in this game there is a lot wacky of letters left behind explaining why has everything gone to hell (pun intended) that were just so annoying. All in all, this aspect of the game was not my cup of tea, but it didn't diminish the over all quality. 
In conclusion, this is another great joint from the uncanny valley man himself. This is the ""Sin City""-fication of Chop Goblins.",1
27183,I like this game. It has a very cheesy horror feel going for it as well as its scary yet goofy as hell soundtrack. My only complaint would be the boss at the very end because its a bullet sponge plus there's barely an indication for when its gonna shoot a projectile. But good game none the less,1
27184,"I had almost forgotten this little gem! I played the original release of Pony Factory as part of the very first DreadX Collection, and I remember I was truly impressed by the sheer amount of pure HORROR that exuded from this short Doom3-inspired first person shooter. So I decided to try out this new standalone release, and I was not disappointed. Brand new lore (that creates a surprisingly deep story), a brand new gameplay mechanic, and even a brand new section are here for you to enjoy! If you have already played this game, I tell you this new version is definitely worth your time and money. If you haven't played it yet, I recommend you do it now, you'll discover a surprisingly scary and atmospheric experience that will keep you on your toes until the very last moments. And possibly will give you nightmares for a few nights ahead. Like all David's games, after all!
Cheers guys!",1
27185,"A nice little homage to Doom 3 and it's flashlight mechanic that a lot of people didn't like back then. As said on the storepage, it's short but there's bonus modes if you're looking for some replay value, an extra challenge or two, or just simply want to get the most of what the improvements offer.",1
27186,"Love the real passion driven development, fueled from inspirations of the past that I have also experienced. Have never had a bad time playing any of these devs games.

What David Szymanski does in regards to games is the exact same thing I want to do. Seriously admirable. Would recommend every single game he's put out.",1
27187,It's a sort scary game which is pretty fun 8/10 I don't like the scary ponies and I think I'm going to be sick :(,1
27188,"Completed this game this morning. I have some good notes and some bad notes. I will start with the bad:

 I do have some issues with it though. I know the darkness is part of the gameplay, and switching between the flashlight and gun is part of the challenge, but even with the flashlight it's genuinely hard to see enemies sometimes. The runner ponies are simple enough to kill, as they just run straight for you, but the mage ponies that shoot projectiles at you are can cause unneeded headaches. The projectiles feel a bit too fast for me to adequately dodge on occasion, and their thin profile and frantic running speed make it genuinely hard to hit them sometimes, especially at a distance. If they're in a bigger room, or at a lower elevation, you sometimes have to deliberately expose yourself from cover to get close enough to hit the buggers, putting yourself in their line of fire in the process. I've experienced multiple instances of running out of ammo in a room due to missing too many shots on the mage ponies as they flitted around at high speed, blending into the background textures. If they're already close to you, sometimes they even walk past/behind you, so you have to turn around and back away from them to get a clear shot, only to see that they're already charging a projectile in the 1.5 seconds you took to do so. Similar problems apply to the boss unfortunately. The boss room is genuinely too dark to see it in certain places, so you either have to get him into one of the colored light sources, or lead him into the dark with nothing but your flashlight to tell you where he is, and at that point he's close enough to pelt you a few times while you shoot him. I genuinely feel like better lighting would alleviate it at bit, allowing you to actually see the targets you're shooting at before they can hit you back. A faster movement speed or at least a limited sprint option would also help imo. Though maybe that's just my noob ass accustomed to the faster and more open combat of boomer shooters like Dusk and Amid Evil that's talking. Another issue I found involved the in-game collision. Occasionally I'd get backed into a corner by a runner pony, or turn a corner too tightly on some stairs, and get stuck in the level geometry. Once that happens there's basically nothing you can do but reload a checkpoint, because there's no action you can do to shimmy your way back out.

That being said, even after all those complaints, I still don't hate this game. I understand that all of the jank and glitches I experienced is due to this being a 10-20 minute long micro-game made by two people for a game-jam. I can't really hold too much against it for that. It still has a lot of sincere charm to it. It's relatively short and straightforward, never overstaying its welcome. It's atmosphere is well done, balancing bleak and gritty horror with cartoonish absurdity. The sense of absurd dark humor in the lore notes, and even in the overarching premise is pretty great, exactly what I would expect from the guy that made Iron Lung, Chop Goblins, Squirrel Stapler, and Dusk. I definitely recommend this game, as long as you have more shooter/horror game skills than my dumb ass, and can get past the janky bits better than I could, and also enjoy these kinds of schlock horror b-movie vibes in your games. I also wish David best of luck on the development of Butcher's Creek. I hope it turns out well. Peace.",1
27189,"I had tons of fun playing this game with my friends, recommend it 100%.",1
27190,"I bought this game on release date for a reason:

I've always enjoyed formidable obstacle courses that take brain power and extreme hand eye coordination to pass (Mainly for bragging rights)

I was astounded when I found out the precision needed to make every jump, the accuracy is bonkers and it really makes you squint your eyes. Sort of like turning the radio down to find a parking spot. You will be punished if you make a bad decision, which to me adds to the suspense of beating it. I get lost in the appealing art style and shadowy effect the game offers. The chill music is also very catchy.

You cant beat the price for what this game offers. Highly recommend. 9.99/10",1
27191,"I recently had the opportunity to try out ""At Light Speed,"" and my experience left me with mixed feelings. This ambitious project has some noteworthy aspects, but it also has some areas where it falls short.


The graphics and visuals in ""At Light Speed"" are impressive, to say the least. The attention to detail in the starships, planets, and celestial objects is commendable. The vastness of space is beautifully rendered, immersing players in a visually captivating universe that's a treat for the eyes.

The game's music is exceptional. It is perfect for the setting of the game and makes you feel calm in a somewhat frustrating game. 

However, ""At Light Speed"" does have some issues. The controls can be somewhat complex, which may pose a steep learning curve for some players. However, the game is designed to be difficult so it isn't really a problem. What is a problem though is that you cannot change keybinds. This can make playing the game tiresome as your fingers are uncomfortable after a certain time of playing the game. 

The performance in this game is very smooth. I didn't drop any/many frames when i was playing, which led to me having a smooth experience playing this game. 


In conclusion, ""At Light Speed"" is a game with potential and grand aspirations. Its stunning visuals and great music make it a game worth playing, but the controls could be better for a game like this where your moves need to be so precise and hopefully they add customisable controls in the future.",1
27192,"What a blast!

This is a frustrating precision puzzle platformer similar in concept to the likes of Only Up, ALTF4 and many others. What I really like about this game compared to those is the skill element. The controls are crisp and precise allowing for a satisfying feel in the air and on ground. It swaps the randomness and frustration of some other platformers and allows you to focus on getting better and streamlining your runs. I love getting better at the wall running mechanic to shave that extra second off my run and it feels great when you pull it off perfectly.

It is deceptively addictive. I find myself constantly saying ""one more run"" and finding justification for why my previous run ""didn't count"". 10/10 recommend.",1

27203,"For me SokPop adventure games have been the highlight of their catalog, even though they are not as popular, I feel like there is more warmth and thought put into how they are made. This game is a bit similar to Pocket Watch and Sokfest, with a small world to explore that has various puzzles and creative mechanics, such as using multiple characters for their special abilities like swimming or jumping. It's a bit strange, I find that these games don't do as well as their sim games, but the reason I prefer these is because they are just so chill and wholesome, full of creativity, and I think this is one of the better games they made, with very little frustration compared to Pocket Watch.

The hand-drawn style was a nice touch, I think a lot of SokPoP games have a tendency to look very similar, but this game felt very different in terms of aesthetic. The game was extremely playful with the interactions, something that SokPoP has been doing very well recently but I don't want to take it for granted, I think making a wholesome game where you enjoy interacting with characters is not easy. You can complete the game in under 2 hours, but be careful because if you complete it, you won't be able to return to collect all of the coins.

For the most part it plays just like any adventure game, although I wish I had the option to just click instead of holding the mouse. Most of the puzzles were easy, the only frustration was finding some items in the grass, so you kinda have to check everything just in case. I thought the character mechanics added a nice flavor to the puzzles, you can use other characters to swim or jump. Very lighthearted story so there is not a ton to talk about, but I thought it ended in a satisfying way, without overlapping previous ideas.

I like that you brought the day/night mechanics similar to Pocket Watch, sometimes you have to use the cycle change to enter stores when the characters are sleeping, so the puzzles can make you think outside the box.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Very playful in terms of character interactions and limited narrative, I thought it was occasionally funny and just overall charming.

(+) I like that puzzles were not very hard, it's a very chill playthrough for the most part, with a few creative ideas like using other characters for their special abilities, as well as the day/night cycle.

(+) The change in the aesthetic was really nice, visually the game was very enjoyable to navigate. Music as well, I like the nice OST change when you swim. For a lighthearted game I thought it was very immersive. 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Just some thoughts: [/u]

- It would be nice if you could add a checkpoint right before the ending so you could return to it
- Add a screenshot feature, which helps to share your game
- The last song puzzle was a bit confusing with the matching 

[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 [/b]

From start to finish I thought this short game was extremely charming, and unlike Pocket Watch or Sokfest, it had less frustration with the puzzles, very chill experience overall. The puzzles were fun, the world was fun, and overall it was very creative. The art style and the music choices complement the story very well, and with that said, it was just really good for a tiny game, love to see it.

27204,"Great hand drawn art style. Short and sweet, took me about an hour and half to finish the whole game. 100% recommend if you're looking for a lovely game that can be finished in one sitting.",1
27205,"Bad things:
1. The final puzzle is unfair. It took me about 50 tries, then i watched community center and saw that it was actually purposely unfair and almost all players had this problem.
2. There is a place where you can just stuck riding a duck under the bottle, and you will be unable to reset, cause you can't pause while you riding a duck. I got to use cte+alt+del. Luckily after resetting you start from a different place on screen.
Good things:
1. Art. Nothing to say, art is very lovely and creates all atmosphere.
2. Metroidvania elements. You finding new abilities to get in new places.
3. You can't stuck using some object in a wrong place, there will be enough worms or seeds or money.
4. Crown achievement. It is like best ending aside of normal ending, and it is not that hard.
5. It is short and easy enough to beat just exploring the area and trying different things (except final puzzle)

So, there is much more good things about this game than bad ones, i reccomend it.",1
27206,"Sokpop does it again, for a genre I am not a fan of they take out all the pain points I usually have and let me enjoy a point and click adventure! Short and simple, careful to respect your time by putting in enough hints and trying to make sure the player can find their way towards the next objective such as putting a road block on a zone once you're finished even with text that says ""you're done here so I'm just helping out by blocking it off"" very nice to enjoy a game like this =)",1
27207,"Beautiful and cozy game. Perfect game after a hard day's work. The music is beautiful, the characters are simple but lovingly designed and the story is entertaining. I liked it very much.",1
27208,"How to make perfect exposition in less than 10 seconds: magical fairy gives ordinary frog ability to think (the worst possible curse as we know). Et voil√†, you're golden! That's it! Cute little hand drawn adventure can begin. World opens up, other creatures and puzzles emerge. Nice few hours on the road back to sweet oblivion pass fast, but the smile remains.",1
27209,"a pretty short but cute point & click adventure, another great Sokpop game!

that speedrunning achievement was a bit stressful however lmao. would still recommend though",1
27210,"This is a pretty fun game, I loved every part of it, there was so much back and forth and I was happy that the snail block the area for me :) overall, it is cute and fun, my only problem was to play the notes based on the listening. I am have some problems differentiating the notes and failed miserably and I had to ask someone to solve it for me. Maybe add an option for that part as I was stuck for 30 mins trying to play the notes. The other thing moving between lily pads sometimes annoys me as I need to move my mouse back to press on the arrow itself and doesn't use the direction to jump. It would be amazing if that is possible too as it will reduce a lot of headache of moving the mouse back and forth. Overall really fun game and easy to play.",1
27211,"I really loved this game! I think we can all relate to the story ‚Äì isn't everyone tired of having a brain and thoughts sometimes?
The art style is absolutely adorable, the story was interesting and the puzzles were actually way more challenging than I expected. I originally just downloaded the game because I thought it looked cute but ended up having a really nice evening thinking about all the possible solutions together with my partner. Highly recommend the game, especially for the price :)",1
27212,"I received this as a gift. I grew up playing a decent number of point-and-click adventure games and always had a soft spot for them. And during the pandemic, we got into Stardew Valley, as did many others. This was our gateway into the modern 'cozy game.' Frog's Adventure is a nice little diversion that scratches both itches, while not requiring much from you. It's a good game to play after a stressful or tiring day. It's not super complicated, but has you tracking what's going on enough that you're not really thinking about anything else, and yet not thinking too hard about the game itself either. It's a nice sweet spot to be in to wind down your day or just have a cute lazy afternoon. I will probably play this again at some point to see if I can get the last couple achievements, but my first playthrough, without looking things up, took me just under 2 hours. I'd recommend this to people of any age as long as they can read, from kids up to adults who just want to relax. $5 is a good price for 2 hours of cute, wholesome, artsy entertainment. Become Frog, have a little adventure, help out some other animals, and solve the overall plot for an ending that takes you right back to where you should be.",1
27213,"Beautiful and sweet adventure. The art and sound are super lovely. I enjoyed it a lot, even tho the puzzles are simple they are rewarding and meaningful.",1
27214,"Very cute and cozy game, I enjoyed it a lot. As long as you use a mouse or trackpad you can play it on the steam deck without problems. :)",1
27215,"Super cutesty, great story, and super fun gameplay dynamics",1
27216,"There was a lot more to it than I expected! Loved the dialogue, sound effects, and cute art style <3",1
27217,"This game is pure bliss and so relaxing.

As you can see from the screenshots ""Frog's Adventure"" is a game with no age restrictions. You coulkd give this to your youngest ones, as long as they can read, and provide them with a good time.

The controls are very simplistic with mouse + left-click only, the given story has no stress or urgency to it, and there is lots to discover. Gradually new gameplay aspects are introduced to keep the short lifespan of the game fresh.

I absolutely loved the music, especially when [spoiler] riding the duck on the ponds[/spoiler].

Frog's Adventure is a great relaxing game especially for young kids. This could be their first adventure. After that, please introduce them to Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle to keep a similar style of fun going!",1
27218,"I could probably just write ""hey, look at his lovely game heehee 10/10"", because the cute art style is what drew me in in the first place while I went looking for games that have frogs in them. But then it turned out, it was also a delight to play. A great mix of having to use a bit of brain power along with a sense of exploration, and a good balance between gameplay, puzzles, progression and well-spirited silliness. I really enjoyed it, so hey just look at this lovely game, heehee 10/10.",1
27219,"Amazing, cute and relaxing game. The only problem i found was the lost connection between Steam and the game (I read it was because I am running it on a Mac). I totally recommend it.",1
27220,"A simple point-and-click with pretty hand-drawn-like art. Very pleasing to look at, and fairly relaxing to play. There are a few puzzles here and there that are a little bit more challenging, but for the most part it's quite simple.

Usually not a big fan of the genre because of how convoluted the puzzles are, but this one did it for me.",1
27221,"A cozy and charming little adventure. I love the level of puzzles and exploration in this; enough to keep me challenged, but never stressful. Also the sound effects are super cute. 

If you want a spark of joy to keep you company on a grey wintry day, help this lil frog out.",1
27222,"So cute and charming! It has a couple of visual bugs, but nothing that takes away from the story or gameplay. The puzzles are a perfect amount of challenging, they make you think, but not too hard that you get frustrated and want to quit. The story is adorable and the visuals are incredibly unique. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to spend just a couple hours with a cute, cozy game!",1
27223,"Fun little game with some difficulty solving the puzzles but only because I'm not smart enough for them. 
The character voices are super fun to listen to and the art is also fun to look at. Would recommend if you want to spend 1 ~ 1.5 hours on a cute little game",1
27224,"I ADORE THIS GAME. It's very quick but there's so much love in it. There was a spot where I almost got stuck, but since it's a point-and-click style puzzle, that's a good thing. It's a delightful little piece of art with a surprise twist! I want more. If you like simple games that are more a piece of art than a game that's got hours and hours of content, this is a good one. 

There was a tiny bug where some text was in the wrong place but it didn't take away from the experience at all.

Frog has brain.",1
27225,This game is such cozy fun and the art style feels nostalgic from doodling as a kid. Very cool idea for a puzzle like game.,1
27226,"Very sweet! Lovely little riddles, cool art, nice story! All around good times! 
I think my total play time was 2-3 hours from start to finish. Buy this if you want a cup of sweet, calming tea for your mind.",1
27227,"This game is honestly just a delight, the story is simple but the hidden object puzzles add a bit of challenge. Get it on sale because it is short, but I do think the challenges the achievements set up add replay value :^)",1
27228,"I got this game in a bundle with some other neat little games.

This game is short and cute. I love that I can play it with just my mouse.

The story is silly and cute, the characters are silly and cute, the game play is silly and cute.

I completed it in about 2 hours, but may come back for a second playthrough.",1
27229,"The characters are charming and all have their little personalities !
The hand drawn graphics are lovely and tickles your curiosity !
The game is relaxing, with small fun puzzles and interactions with the environment.
The music is really nice and have an animal crossing feel ! 
Also the nature ambiant sounds are absolutely cool for immersion !

Definitely a small gem !",1
27230,"I loooved this game!! the puzzles were really fun, the graphics are sooo good and the sounds are so satisfying. the world was so immersive and charming and I will never get over the hand-drawn style! the only downside was my hand got sore from click to move lolll but other than that this was such a delightful experience.

agree with the message too, brains bad üëç",1
27231,"Nice game, makes you use a brain, cute story, innocent looking crimes.",1
27232,"My girlfriend got me this game as a gift today and I knew instantly that this was gonna be a total home run! It was short, sweet, and it's puzzles were not too terribly complicated. It's writing is fantastic and will give you some laughs! The art style of this game nothing short of adorable and really lures out some nostalgia from your inner-kid. If you are reading this, no matter who you are or however old you may be, please consider giving this one a shot cause there really aren't many games that get it so right quite like this one.",1
27233,"Love cute little games like this, very wholesome. I enjoyed it overall, but I don't recommend playing on steam deck. It worked but the controls used the trackpad which felt very uncomfortable.

27234,"This is a delightful little game with some replayability, focusing on a frog who has been made sentient. You have to remove that sentience. It's very fun and pleasant, with lovely graphics.

27241,"A short but sweet game about the horros of having thoughts.

The levels aren't big, but packed with little things to find and places to reach once you find out how - a bit metroidvenia like.",1
27242,"This is a very relaxing and charming point and click adventure game, with a very cute art style and simple but rewarding puzzles, enjoyable for all ages, best part about it is being a frog :)",1
27243,"It has its issues--playing in full screen mode made the frog's walk speed almost unbearably slow (this might just be my PC, though), sometimes the text floats out of their designated boxes, and there are a few bugs (my friend who also played the game somehow managed to swim on the ground, and couldn't progress until he restarted). Getting stuck on a puzzle may make you feel really dumb, because Frog's Adventure's whimsical coloring-book art style may make you underestimate it (this might also just be a Me problem). The frog can only be controlled with the mouse/trackpad, which can make your fingers sore if you play for too long; being able to move with the directional or WASD keys would've been nice. 

But it has its charms. The aforementioned art style is wonderful, a treat for the eyes. The story, while nothing breathtaking, is fun to read. The game isn't very long, either; even if you take your time, it's unlikely for one run to go beyond 2 hours, so whatever frustrations come from getting stuck with a puzzle probably won't last long. (There's an achievement for doing a run in under 20 minutes.) 

Though I have my gripes, it's hard to hate. If you're looking for a short and sweet all-ages game, you can't go wrong with Frog's Adventure. 


*As of writing, the only negative review this game has is about getting stuck on a puzzle because they ""did it in the wrong order"", which isn't actually possible. The solution to the puzzle is always just somewhere. There's always a way to keep going. ...But it's not impossible to feel stuck, since sometimes the items needed to progress are hard to spot.",1
27244,"Short, funny and charming point & click adventure game. Recommended for all Frog lovers.",1
27245,"A very charming, peaceful and surprisingly meaningful experience - and I'm not just saying that because I love frogs!",1
27246,"A pleasant little adventure with fun puzzles. Similar vibes to A Short Hike, but point and click.",1
27247,Fun casual point and click adventure. Great if you like small woodland animals.,1
27248,"Wonderful little 2 hour experience. Some of the best execution on ""hand drawn""  aesthetics I've seen, especially at this small scale. Really enjoyed it.",1
27249,"I got this game cause it looked cute but unfortunately, there are some MAJOR BUGS to this game which makes me don't want to continue.
For example the worms in chapter 2, it requires you to get 1 worm for the fish to get the key which is important to progress in the story, but it also asks you to give 3 worms to the duck to enter its house. The problem is there were ONLY 3 worms that you can find in the map. If you didn't give that 1 worm to the frog, instead you gave it to the duck (because how am i supposed to know whom to give first???) then you wouldn't be able to proceed the story. 
Also in chapter 5 where it requires you to get lily pad seeds in different spots and there aren't sufficient seeds you can get in the map(some seeds you have to FIRST get the seed to get to it)

However, you could start over and follow the steps in its correct order but it totally destroys the experience. NOT ENJOYABLE! I wish this game was designed better, if it wasn't for the flaws I would totally recommend it.

27256,"Well, took me 4 hours but I completely finished the game, I normally don't say this but read the tips and trick section of this review, it will save you hours of grinding, it will be after the review itself and I might put it in a guide since there are only 2 guide for the game currently.

The game was fun, especially when I found a trick that saved me time otherwise I was thinking of stopping after finishing most of the quests and not completing everything.

Gameplay: There are 2 main things to do in the game, do quests which are mostly fetch quests and material gathering which is hell, it takes like 4 hits to break a stone/tree and only get 1-2 materials from them, and it is so slow too, it is awful, I can't imagine how long it will take to finish everything doing it normally. As for the quests, they are okay, just a lot of running around, when you get the wand (Item that let's you ride animals) always be on an animal, it will save so much time.

Story: There isn't too much, but there is some story, mostly about the character, but even that isn't too much, still, I had fun reading the dialog, although there were a few times were the dialog wasn't translated.

Sex: I have mixed feeling about it, it wasn't bad but also wasn't amazing, it was sometimes okay and sometime good, I'm talking about art to animation, the art looked good at time and at other had me go ""Okay"" since I could see a few mistakes, though not big ones, the animation, you could see missing limbs or how some of the body dislocates from the rest for the movement, overall I wouldn't say it is bad, but it isn't amazing. On the plus side, there are a lot of animations, each character has 2 (With one character having 3 and another having a few and letting you control it which is different from the rest) and 2 pixel animations (I think that's what it's called or maybe 2dlive animation, anyway, it is the character having sex in the background instead of big art and animation) it is mostly the same with a bit of a different look but at least 1 was different from the big animation.

Sound: Now this is where I had to scratch my head while letting out a chuckle, I recognized some of the moans in the game from 2 other games I played, now, I checked and this is a different dev from the one that made the other 2 games, so when there was a reappearance of the moans in the second game I played from the other dev, I was ""Okay, same dev"" but now I'm wondering if there is some Chinese moaning site or something where you can buy moaning sounds (I assume there is) anyway, it was funny to me, sorry for going off track. other than that, it was okay, the moaning wasn't anything special, it is just moaning and the music is nice.

Overall, for the price I would recommend the game, it is a fun game and has a lot of animations with a good art (Okay sometimes), if you want a game where you can kind of mindlessly do quests and get sex as a reward, I would recommend this game, now to tips and tricks. Those that leave now have a great day.

Now, I will start with something I found near the end of the game and could have saved me so much trouble, I will tell a bit of a story, I was planning on putting in the review a warning about selling gold, because gold is important, you need so much and it costs a lot, but after finding this trick it doesn't matter, the trick needs the magic wand, which I don't know how to get since it just appeared in my inventory out of nowhere.

The magic wand allows you to ride an animal and if you click the wand it stores the animal in your inventory, now, money is a pain to get in this game and so is all other materials, that is until you get this wand, it is beyond broken, a stored animal sells for 200 (pigs) and 250 (cows) and now is the broken part, if you go beyond the bridge at the starting island, it is cow heaven, everytime you go into that zone like 10 cows spawn, so if you go in, catch all and out, and repeat, you can in 2 minutes get a few 10k money, and with that you can buy everything you need, it is an absolute game changer that saves hours of grind materials slowly.

As for how to get, like I said, I don't know when I got it, but it might be either from a main island npc or the one on harmony island (The one with the merchant). That's it, check your inventory and if you have the wand you are sorted.

Second tip, when you go into the pyramid, take 30 gold and bandages from the merchant, the pyramid is a maze so it is annoying to go back and forth, this way you have everything with you. As for the maze, I don't remember it completely, but at the start go left once and then up until you reach near the top and try going right, it is like in the middle right of the pyramid where the npc is.

Third, there is a slave in the desert, you can buy her when you max your house.

That's kind of it I think, I had more but they became useless when I found the wand trick, I guess a bit of a quest help, grow 20 carrots (10 seeds), the harmony island carrots don't work for quests, also, remember to go get those carrots and the watermelons in the desert, great energy source.

Oh! I almost forgot, after finishing Susu's quest line, there is a dialog without translation, but after that you get a magic stone, I didn't even know I had it, I only found out when I went to the portal on the left of starter island after that quest, so I'm pretty sure it is from her. The stone is for the portal.

Well, I think that's it, the wand trick should let you have an easy time, just go to where the cows spawn, put the wand on the 1 button or another easy one and then just go around, when you see a cow press 1 (Assuming you are on a mount) which will put the current mount in the inventory and click on the other and repeat until you only have the cow you are riding and go up to the next area and back down to respawn the cows and repeat, you get tens of thousands of money easily like that.

I came back to add, build at least one sprinkler, the range is huge and it will save you a lot of work watering everything which is extremely slow, sprinklers are easy to make too, you buy the blueprint from the carpenter.

Anyway, I hope this helps, if you read to here thank you and I hope you have a great day,",1

Final Decision :
- There are many shortcomings and many inconsistencies in the story. It's more like a trial game. There are much better games in the same genre.

NOTE:
- In the Graphics (Art) section, I decide based on the type of game and the game engine it uses.
- I'm not a game editor. That's why I won't rate it.
- Playing time may vary from person to person. I base it on the time I play.
- Not every error may occur on every computer.
- Continuity (Grind) may have different meanings depending on the game type. While action role-playing and similar games require constant continuity, open world and adventure games are only required to progress.
- I will not be writing for PC Requirements. If you are reading comments about the game, I think your system meets the requirements.",0
27259,"Game is either incredibly bugged or bad.

27260,"It's a really good Stardew Valley/Village Rhapsody game! I love the animation, all these characters and the gameplay itself. The only downside i can think of about the game is it's so SLOW, but at least in like mid game we can tame animals to move faster and doing some exploits lol. 

There are also some untraslated parts which are annoying, but with the help of google translate it's okay, there's also the fact that the scenes do get boring which there are only 2 scenes, and i just wish they will get more creative with it like add us an option to zoom in and zoom out maybe, more costumes like in Village Rhapsody and let us i guess pick where to have H. The only one that enables this is The slave girl which is okay at most tbh. 

Overall really good H Game especially for the PRICE!! I just hope the devs fix those untranslated parts and also add a GALLARY!! for us to view those scenes again cause it's really missing it here. 8/10 game and would beat my meat to it!",1

The tutorial is a bit wonky but nothing too troublesome, there are some parts where the translation did not take effect, not too troublesome, so far no disruptive bugs, overall it is pretty good. There are certain contents that are not ready yet but I believe it will come in due time. [strike]Not many H scenes at the moment but it is suffice to make you stand hard and burst.[/strike]. Plenty of H scenes, hoard up your napkins and prepare for the flood gates to open.

I personally like this game because it reminds me of a certain Village*****, though many may consider this to be a copy-paste but I would beg to differ. Hooligan Crusoe definitely will grow as time progresses, I mean, the ladies art are terrific and mouthwatering! Recommended.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Hooligan Crusoe is a Unity based farming game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You awaken on an unknown island. The local chief comes to greet you on the beach and offers you a tent. You stay on the island, and your adventures continue as you explore other nearby islands.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game starts off with the language defaulted to Chinese. Language is the third option from the top.  When you start a new game, the first thing you do is to set your character name. There is no default name.

Each woman has three quests for you to complete to unlock their content. Some of the quests are simple, others, not so much. There are six different islands to explore. Each island offers different women to assist. If the women don't live on your island, you can build a house for them and they will move to the island to make it easier for the two of you to get together.

There are at least 19 different women. After you have done their quests and unlock their content they have two scenes that you can switch between.

The English in general is fine, there are some things that are not translated, the first Neko on your island being the one that is the most notable. The developer is still updating the game, the last update was last month.

There are a lot of improvements that could be made: increasing the passage of time (like one second real time equals one minute game time) and improved resource collection items (faster collection times), for example. The time is a big one, you can use all of your stamina in the first half hour of the day and things you plant require days to go by in order to grow. You can easily restore your stamina with food, the problem is that you can do a whole lot before you have to go to sleep.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery. You can visit the women again, after you have unlocked their content and replay it. This can be made easier by building them a house on your island.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
The game isn't great, but it is an amazing value for the price. There are a ton of quality of life improvements that could be made, but you can't beat the value.

[h1]System Specs[/h1]
CPU: AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ 9 7950X3D
Motherboard: Gigabyte X670E AORUS EXTREME (rev. 1x)
RAM: G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo Series (AMD Expo) DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB)

27296,"This game is just ""fine"" and im gonna explain my reasons.
-First of all, i have to be honest: the art is amazing. The only exception are the eyes animations when they narrow and expand, but the rest of the art is amazing, so congratulations!
-The soundtrack is also really good. I liked all the tracks.
The core of the plot is fine, surpassing the bad times and fighting against yourself, but here are the bad things:
-The game is too short, really short. I had no time to feel anything with the main character, nor Hina or Rei.
-The endings are really dissapointing. I won¬¥t spoil anything, but in the end, you won¬¥t see anything. Its a bad conclusion
-There a lack of different choices. The decisions you make just change some dialogues, but those decisions won¬¥t affect the story.
Just as conclusion: you have potential. Your art is amazing. You should have to improve your writing or you could hire some good screenwriter and you¬¥d work just in the art, but i recommend you to follow the path you want.
Congratulations for your game! I¬¥ll take a look in your future works n.n",1
27297,"[h1] A hidden gem held back by it's length [/h1] 

I should start off by saying that i was very pleasantly surprised with Last Resort, so much so that it has earned a spot among my favorite VN experiences of all time (with emphasis on ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù, I‚Äôll go into more detail about this later on) and exceeded my expectations that were set from other reviews.

[h2]The Good[/h2]

The biggest praise i could give to this game would have to go towards it's excellent writing, that, despite it's short length, managed to convey the exact emotions it aimed for with such accuracy that it made me sob a few times, and even made me take a break to recollect my thoughts, despite not being the kind of person that‚Äôs usually affected by games to such a degree. It‚Äôs a shame too, because I feel that a lot of people might‚Äôve misunderstood the developer‚Äôs intentions and attributed that to the writing being ‚Äúbad‚Äù. It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain stuff like that without making them feel like a ‚Äúto be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty‚Äù type of situation, but bear with me. At the end of the game, you receive a note by the developer stating, among other things, that ‚Äú[spoiler] Every one of us wants to run away from our problems from time to time [/spoiler]. That‚Äôs [b] the feeling [/b] I‚Äôve tried to put into the ‚ÄúLast Resort‚Äù.‚Äù And, knowing the vast thematic scope that the game went for and it‚Äôs incredibly limited runtime, it couldn‚Äôt really be any different. The point wasn‚Äôt for the player to emotionally connect with the characters themselves per se, but for the characters to act as a reflection of the player‚Äôs own life struggles. The emotional resonation is meant to happen through the incredibly accurate representation of the thoughts and feelings that the protagonist goes through during the events of the game. Or at least that was my personal interpretation that allowed me to enjoy the game as much as I did. Aside from the writing, the artwork is also very pretty, the animations were better than I expected them to be and the soundtrack was nice too.

[h2]The Not-So-Good[/h2]

Considering the game‚Äôs main theme is escapism due to disappointment in our everyday lives, it‚Äôd be nice to see a bit more of the protagonist‚Äôs everyday routine and actively experience his thoughts during it instead of being quickly filled in on his background before going straight to the main plotline. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean it went on for too long. On the contrary, the main issue lies in the game‚Äôs incredibly limited length which didn‚Äôt allow it to deviate from the main plot. In that sense, the execution couldn‚Äôt have been much better, but at it‚Äôs current state it almost feels more like a proof of concept and the developer‚Äôs talent in writing rather that the full-fledged visual novel it could have been. It‚Äôs not an incomplete visual novel by all means, but based on it‚Äôs scope it doesn‚Äôt feel fully realized. However, it still does offer a worthwhile experience at a fair price. Aside from that, there‚Äôs a violin track that plays around the beginning and the end of the game that has a weird 360 effect where you hear the violin constantly rotating around your head if you wear headphones. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs intentional or not, but I found it incredibly distracting. I‚Äôll also agree with other reviews that the bouncing in the eyes‚Äô irises was a bit excessive, and in my opinion so were the bouncing question/exclamation marks and multiple hearts. It would maybe make sense in an H game to signify progression, but in a normal vn they were a bit too much, and a simple face expression or at least fewer popup symbols could‚Äôve done the job. Lastly, while I wouldn‚Äôt outright categorize it as a negative, the voice acting unfortunately ended up breaking my immersion more than anything so I opted to disable it. I personally didn‚Äôt find the deeper voices and the Russian language to fit the characters that, unless I‚Äôm missing out something, weren‚Äôt supposed to be Russian. But again, it‚Äôs not really a negative. The voice acting is more of an added bonus from the developer, and the lack of voice acting is just as serviceable.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Hidden Resort is an emotionally engaging, worthwhile experience that unfortunately doesn‚Äôt deliver as much as it could due to it‚Äôs short length. Despite it‚Äôs shortcomings, it delivers what it promises at a fair price.
[b]Final Score:[/b] 8/10

27298,"this game feels incomplete but doesn't show much to make you want to see it further. the concept of going back in time to fix our past is nothing new and there's nothing here that makes it fresh. the characterization feels loose, the motive feels loose, everything about the writing is empty. i like the idea of some of the intent the author writes out in the ending but it's not here in the game itself.",0
27299,"Disclaimer: I received a review key for free.

Last Resort is a very short, but solid game. It tells a very succinct story with very ambient music, good Russian voice acting, and Live2D models that really make it pop! Even at full price it's a nice little game that I'd recommend.

PROS:
+Clean and detailed setpiece art
+Well rigged Live2D heroines
+Good voice acting! At this price point that was VERY surprising!

CONS:
-Very short. It tells multiple tales in a very short amount of time.
+/- Has auto advancing dialogue as an option, but it cannot be adjusted.


It's $4 at the time of this writing. Go check it out for a short morally driven story that wastes no time doing exactly what it claims to do.",1
27300,"Game's pretty fine, but too short (1-1.5 hour maybe). Also, the plot is VERY dynamic, so... the ending was unexpected.",1
27301,"Even though this game took me only twenty minutes to finish, I really liked the story a lot, it really resonated with me and is super relatable, amazing art and pleasant music.  The voice acting was good but I turned it off because I'm not a Russian speaker but I could tell it was good voice acting. 

Pros: 
Beautiful 
Fun
No Wasted Words
Satisfying Game and Great Achievements
Cons
Short
No English Voice Acting (for me)

9/10! If it was a little longer with more fleshed out endings, this would be perfect!  But in and of itself, it's a wonderful game!",1
27302,"While short, this story was very sweet and touching. I was hooked from the moment I started reading, and didn't stop until I had all the endings and achievements. Also, the art. WOW is all I can say! I absolutely loved every picture and character art. Several times I stopped to just admire the backgrounds. While I did get this game in a giveaway, I would gladly have paid the small price to experience this sweet story. While it is apparent English wasn't the first language for the game, the translation was very well done, and I didn't notice any real big mistakes when reading thru myself, aside from just some odd wording in a couple places. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the main character just being labeled as ""Him"", but that is such a small thing it barely needs mentioning. Maybe in a future update a name could be given to him or just change the label to ""Me"" or something, as I was confused for a minute about who ""Him"" might be. I highly recommend this visual novel for those looking for a quick read that has a very sweet story!",1

27308,"Too little, too late.

This game actually released in October 2022; what you're looking at is a second ""duplicate"" listing that only includes the battle royale mode, Eternal Battle. The original game [i]should[/i] have released for free with optional paid DLCs for the other modes (like how Tetris 99 is free on Switch but you can pay for single-player modes), but since they didn't release it that way, the next best thing would have been to change the original listing to work like that. Instead, they made a completely different listing for the free version.

You may think it doesn't matter that they made a duplicate store listing, but 1) if you switch, you need to redownload the entire game (thankfully it's not that large), and 2) your playtime and achievement progress will [i]not[/i] transfer from the F2P version to the paid version. (Only leaderboards will transfer, since those are stored server-side.) Unlike what the F2P store description implies, you cannot purchase the other modes individually and continue playing this version; if you want the other modes, you need to switch to the original, paid version of the game.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717270/Arkanoid__Eternal_Battle/]The original listing goes on sale for $2 pretty often.[/url] What I would recommend doing is trying the F2P version to see if you like how Eternal Battle plays (you will end up playing with AIs because the online is dead) and then picking up the paid version for the full experience.",0
27309,"Not sure what to think about it.
Great gameplay, visual style and vibe, but sadly nobody plays it.
With release date being 21 Dec, 2023, I have my doubts it will get any better with time.
Game is good but it only offers online mode without people, so you are stuck with bots.

",0
27310,"Actually Fun! Sure the online might be dead, but that's only cause its just released free. all it takes is a little push to bring more players in.

Its basically your childhood brick breaker game against 24 other players! You basically just try to keep the highest score to win!",1
27311,"This version of ARKANOID is just to sell you on the FULL VERSION and it's DLCs. This game has ONLY one terrible mode, all other options lead you to BUY, BUY, and yes you guessed it, MORE BUYING! This version would not be so bad if you could play alone, choose the amount of opponents (AI) when you wanted, turned off the stupid and un-necessary graphics that flash across your gameplay endlessly, and of course not be forced to BUY, BUY, BUY!!!

If the Developer/Publisher want players (as there are none in game ever, just AI) then they will need to make some changes fast, as this FREE to PLAY game is perfectly fit for the PIT!

Some suggestions:
- Extend ""waiting for other players"" time, or make it customizable.
- Add the option to invite and challenge friends.
- Add more rewards (other than custom backgrounds) or achievements to keep players coming back.
- Let human players join an already started game.
- Give names to AI players.",1
27315,"I like the visuals and how much fun playing the game is. However, as many have said, it was released way too late. You won't be able to fill the whole game with real players, but luckily you can still play with bots. As you can guess, it gets boring very fast if you only play with AI.

What I don't like is that, especially at the beginning of the game, other people's screens are flying left and right in the background. It's too distracting and, at least for the old me, I lose track of my own ball(s) all the time. There's also no support for keyboard and you can only move your paddle craft using mouse.

I had hoped it would be much more popular - it's not Tetris, of course, but it's still disappointing to see so few people playing it. But, as much as it pains me to say it, it might be the developer/publisher's fault for deciding to release the free version so late. We can only imagine that it would attract a much larger player base, and those players could end up buying the full game. But that's just me playing a little guess game.

I recommend everyone to give it a try. If you remember the original Arkanoid, you'll be surprised by this one, and the ""end phase"" of the battle royale matches is something interesting that I never expected to see. For that alone, it's worth downloading and playing through, even with bots.",1
27316,"The release is a bit way too late but better late then never. I get it, if this was released the same time as the full version no one would of got it, so instead you release it when the full version of the game is pretty much dead. The full version price should of just been adjusted then releasing a free version over a year later.

This is a fun game and the battle royale makes it great but unfortunately you will be mostly be playing with bots as the full version didn't attract enough people because of the price. Maybe with the release of the F2P version more people will return to this game. If you love this game I strongly encourage you to get your friends to play along and help populate the servers. Graphics are good and also so is the music. Make Arkanoid Great Again!",1

27326,"Listen, I'm not here to make any excuses. Squirrel Stapler is batshit insane, and I loved every moment of it. My only regret is not visiting the Shady Shack on day 1, but there's always next run! If you love weird, surreal, totally absurdist indie horror, you can't go wrong with Squirrel Stapler. It'll be the best time you've ever had stapling dead squirrels to rotting carcasses, and you can quote me on that!

27329,"As someone who has played through Squirrel Stapler through the Dread X Collection II, I can't say that I was too impressed with the additions that the stand alone release provides. I wouldn't be surprised if it took Szymanski a day to implement all of the changes of the stand alone release. Considering the asking price of the game is only 2 dollars less than the dread x collection 2, which contains an extremely similar version of squirrel stapler along with 11 other games, I would have to recommend the dread x collection instead as its just a way better value for your money",0
27330,"Squirrel Stapler, as the store page puts it, is a game where you hunt squirrels, staple them to a corpse, and meet god. This game is not simple. Appearances in this game are often deceptive. Likewise, I assume that anyone reading this review will have the intellectual engagement to read its contents, rather than expect it to run like an answer key to a multiple-choice quiz.

Since Squirrel Stapler is such an open-ended game, no single understanding of the events of the game can be regarded as ""correct"" above other understandings. The purpose of the discussion in this review is not to establish a final authority on the events of Squirrel Stapler, but to provide one unified grasp of the game that answers the majority of the questions presented within the game. 

As I have played and studied the game, I have concluded that the plot of Squirrel Stapler exists on four different levels of narrative reality. These four levels of narrative reality are:  the Cosmic level; the Political level; the Individual level; and the Squirrel level. All of these narrative levels progress at the same time, and they interweave through each other. In the interest of keeping my explanation unconvoluted, I will describe the flow of each of the four narrative levels, insofar as they operate independent of each other. 

The Cosmic Level of the narrative is the easiest to describe. However, I should clarify up front that there are three different entities known as ""Stapler"" in this game. They look alike and speak alike; they are related to each other; however, they are distinct from each other. I will describe each of them, as they relate to their respective levels of narrative. The ""Stapler"" on the Cosmic Level of narrative is the character who I refer to as ""Germanic Stapler,"" or G. S. I name him ""Germanic Stapler"" because his manner of living suggests that he belongs to a spiritual tradition related to Western religious heritage, which is dominated by religious traditions that find their roots in Germanic history.

G. S. is described as ""the squirrel stapler."" His rival is the Squirrel, who is described as storing and preserving ""the Nuts of God."" G. S. represents Western culture and civilization: Europe and the Americas. The Squirrel represents Eastern culture and civilization: the Asian continental nations and Japan. During the first day of the game, we see that G. S. uses energy drinks (in the Squirrel Stapler group) as transportation. He and the Squirrel have a long history of friendship, though they seem to regard each other with professional (rather than personal) affection. They reflect upon their competitive relationship as experienced via chess games; most of the time, G. S. wins.

David Szymanski (the visionary developer of the game) has been quoted as remarking that G. S. and the Squirrel represent ""the futility of war."" This seems most keenly expressed in the game's final epilogue, which occurs 5 days after the game begins in the forest. I do not disagree with David Szymanski's comment; I would add, also, that it seems to represent the inevitability of war and the eternal irresolution of differences between East and West, so long as one attempts to aggress upon the other. 

At the end of the first day, G. S. fires a tank-piercing bullet at the Squirrel, who dies and is attached to G. S.'s wife after having been killed by its impact. This moment signifies the beginning of the ""chess game"" that occurs in the forest, through the course of the game's events. The only time G. S. appears is when he is in the company of the Squirrel. 

Squirrel Stapler is a post-modern story, and (as such) leaves many holes for the gamer to fill with his or her personal explanations. If I wrote this review with the intention of wresting those holes from the reader and filling them with my own explanations, then I would have betrayed the vision of the creative team.",1

It talks about [b]greedy women[/b] that chase the beauty no matter what, even if it's gonna cost a dozen squires their lives. It teaches you to [b]respect the woods[/b], to not disrupt the natural order of things and most importantly, [b]don't camp at supposedly cursed land[/b]. It teaches you the basics of hunting: [b]be sneaky, be patient, use your ears and special tools[/b] to make prey give away it's own position. [u]It's simply a masterpiece.[/u]

Main protagonist is one cold son of a b!tch. Every day he commits destructive acts against nature to gain personal benefits, and you gain points for that.

27344,"Squirrel Stapler is not new. It is also playable in Dread X 2, which released on Steam 3 years ago. Dread X 2 contains a whopping 12 games like this one, but for almost the exact same price.

I played Squirrel Stapler in Dread X 2 and enjoyed it, so i was very excited to replay this standalone release after reading about it on the store page and seeing that it has ""a more alive forest"", ""quality of life"" and ""new goodies"". I completed the entire game, and discovered all the content. I very much stand by the opinion that despite what its store page says, this game does Not contain any noteworthy new gameplay-related content that increases its value.

The game is much easier in this release, which i actually see as a downside, because i thought Squirrel Stapler in Dread X 2 had a nice difficulty curve. The new Energy drinks makes the enemies much too easy to not interact with.

The game's forest is not more alive in any noticable way. There is one new building that doesn't change how the game is played, and a new squirrel that behaves the same but gives two points.

I like Squirrel Stapler. It is very stylistic and charming. But i cannot recommend this version whatsoever. It is very overpriced and changes nothing noteworthy! Buy Dread X 2 for the same amount of money and enjoy Squirrel Stapler there.",0
27345,If you ever wanted to add some dark religious undertones to killing vermin for an hour then this is the game for you.,1
27346,"Suspense game hidden in a ""poorly designed"" hunting simulator. Nothing to hate about this game except that I wish there was a night mode and more creepy things to kill me. 

In the game, you have 5 days until god comes.
Right now, you have 5 seconds to buy this game if you haven't already.

27347,"And you may find yourself, living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the stock of a varmint rifle
and you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife without skin and there are Squirrel's you must staple to meet god...
And you may ask yourself, ""Well, how did I get here?""",1
27348,"Amazing as always. No one creates uncomfortable atmosphere like Szymanski.

I want Brad Pitt for the movie.",1
27349,"[h1]Squirrel Stapler[/h1]
[h2]Putting a drunken idea to work[/h2]
David Szymanski is known as Dusk developer first. ""My favorite boomer shooter youtuber made a video on his game once"", and this is where the story ends. But over the years David accumulated a sizable library of good games. For example - Iron Lung, which not too long ago Reddit review bombed after OceanGate disaster. ""Repeating the joke 20 times makes it 20 times better""; The Music Machine is a hidden gem for any autist obsessed with art directions in games, such as myself; and Gloomwood is taking forever to just come out. And today's star: Squirrel Stapler, which originally started as one of the games in Dread X Collection 2.

[h2]Stapling the squirrels[/h2]
This game is dumb, utterly retarded even. It's a cocktail of absurdity and horror. It shouldn't work, but it does. I don't know how else to describe this anomaly of a game.
The forest is an open map with half a dozen points of interest. It could be notes, which tell two separate stories every day, shady shack or just consumables. The best thing to do here is hunting for squirrels. The second best thing is enjoying the atmosphere. Sounds of animal life, the wind howling, and rustling of leaves - I wouldn't normally care about that, but Squirrel Stapler is an exception. It's the matter of contrast. What this game goes for works because there is a contrast between normal and absurd. David Szymanski got away with making a borderline shitpost, and I applaud him for that.
I have nothing else to say. This is one of those games that you should play for yourself. Don't watch anyone play it - jump right into it blind. Play Szymanski's other games too, while you are at it.
",1
27350,"Now THAT'S a game for me.  A game that knows its a game, a game that respects my time, a game that has that sprinkling of fun Szymanski detail. 

I want more.  I cannot wait to get my hands on David's next game, the Condemned-inspired Butcher's Creek, but I'd also love some Squirrel Stapler XL in the future.",1
27351,"I committed sins at the shack, drank some energy drinks, hunted double-headed squirrels to staple onto my wife, read some nice poetry, met God once again and learned that the wise man stores his nuts for the proper time.                                    
             10/10 re-release would commit sins and meet God again.",1
27352,"The Good:
I enjoyed the horror-comedy of the game. It was entertaining and fun, It was serious and unserious and did not feel like a gimmick. The pixelated grungy look appealed to me. The squirrels are scary... I actually jumped really good at one moment in the game. My B*tch wife isnt beautiful enough. She need more of God's beauty. 

The Bad:
Cant critique it that bad tbh, short and sweet game. Wish there was a bit more content. Like maybe more gimmicky modes like the large squirrels, maybe a nightmare night when the hunter sleeps going after the ghost squirrels.

The Ugly:
I did not get too witness more of the rodents beauty.",1

27354,"Outrageously overpriced for what it has to offer, just like most of the Szymanski's games, except few.

It's very hard to rate this game because the concept is definitively there. It's dark, twisted and menacing, but at the same time the realization is [b]so[/b] cheap it just makes it a total cringe fest / interactive meme-product and while playing you can't stop thinking what did I just really pay for. Something like this should literally be [b]free[/b], just like his early [i]""Fingerbones""[/i].

Anyways, if you dig this perplexing weird vibe, look into the old VHS tape called [i]""Exploding Varmints""[/i] from the bootleg [i]""Ensuring your place in hell: Volume 1""[/i]. I'm sure some inspirations were taken from there.",0

27356,"Ok listen, I didn't know this game was a horror game when I first got it, and that's my own fault for not heeding the warning of steam telling me that this game was similar to Iron Lung. I about shit myself when I encountered my first squirrel-bear when out hunting, and ran in pointless circles with it until I finally shot it and it EXPLODED. Which scared me even more since I had no idea what the hell I got myself into. Despite not researching it enough and kind of just getting it cause it seemed silly while on sale, I did actually really enjoy this game. It was challenging but not so hard that I just wanted to quit, and I was able to get 100% achievements! Which is always nice. overall 10/10, God comes weirdly fast on day 5.",1
27357,"I still love this game! It was the reason why I bought Dread X Collection II to begin with. If you're new to the game, its one hell of a ride haha. A short but sweet ride. Unique concept with some strange stories to unravel as you trot through the forest looking for those damn squirrels! No spoilers. You've got to play it!

For returning players such as myself, there isn't too much extra to bite into unfortunately. There are some extra items to look out for, a new unlockable Big Squirrel Mode, and achievements to unlock. It was worth it to me as a big fan of this game, but I really wish there was an additional map to explore and engage in squirrel genocide. I also don't mind giving Dave Szymanski my money as he has produced some outstanding games over the years. 

I love it. Unique, fun, and squirrely. Highly recommended for new players, but i will leave it up to the previous Dread X Collection II players to decide if its worth paying for it again",1

My issue is that I don't know what direction I'm facing. Maybe changing it to an arrow that points to what direction I'm facing would help.

27362,"Finally freed from the shackles of the iconic Dread X series, the standalone version of Squirrel Stapler is just everything but more. On the surface it is just a simple remaster of an already great game, but it adds some welcome finishing touches that enhance the horror and comedic aspects of the game greatly.

So the game itself is a slow-paced hunting sim, although the brevity and clarity of the game helps it avoid the tedium that usually plagues the genre. It's more focused on creating an enjoyable experience than it is on anything akin to realism or challenge, and you just have to love it for that. The horror aspect is surprisingly well done for how often it mixes in overt jokes, although considering the dev's legacy, that's no surprise. There's not much replay value, but it's not designed with that in mind, and honestly it's no issue. It's uncomfortable, weird, but undeniably a great experience. It's Dave Szymanski. It's stapling squirrels to your wife's corpse. It's exactly what you think it is, and a little more. Absolutely recommend.",1

The energy drinks i found especially nice for achievement hunting altough i did feel it removed the small bit of challenge the game originally had i feel it would have been better if you unlocked energy drinks after finishing the game once. The sin shack was fun altough i dont get the point of getting more score, is there maybe a secret ending if you get enough score? I dont believe so but ill try it. The double squirrel was a nice addition for when they show up and the other improvements where nice. I do wish there was some third mode though which included a lot more new stuff(primarily squirrel types) but i do understand the dev for not wanting too add more then nessecary although i really wish he did.",1

Squirrel Stapler, much like David Szymanski's other shorter games like Iron Lung and Chop Goblins, is an incredible experience that is unique, fascinating, and just plain crazy. It's the type of experience that you can only get from a David Szymanski game. Squirrel Stapler puts you in the shoes of a hunter who goes out to hunt squirrels to staple onto his wife. Yup, that's the plot of this game. As you go about your days though more obstacles are thrown your way which change the way you approach the game. It's very well done and keeps the repetitive tasks fun and engaging. You can also do a little bit of exploring to uncover a pretty insane story. The map was surprisingly bigger than I was expecting and you quickly learn how to use the landmarks to help you navigate and know where you can run to in order to resupply on ammo and health. This is definitely an experience worth playing and I think the price tag is justified despite being very short due to the very high quality and memorable experience you get here.

27374,"""Laruaville 5"" is a great match-3 game with unique mechanics and minigames (Mahjong, spot the difference and hidden object games). It runs flawlessly and it will stimulate your brain! A very tricky match-3 with power-ups and unique ways to solve the puzzles. Help the cute ghosts survive and build a boat to go back to the mainland after their ship sunk!

The levels themselves are hard but leave an impression and above all they are fun. So you will be glad it wasn't a piece of cake that required no thinking and ended in 10 minutes. The visual effects, animations and music will help a lot in keeping you calm and focused on the task at hand.
If you are stuck, you can use the hint system, which I find very good, comprehensive and helpful. On top of that, they have added a beautifully crafted grimoire as help.

It will keep you busy for hours but without overstaying its welcome and you can always replay it due to its nature. Featuring different modes, minigames and building your town!

One of the most fun and intriguing match-3 puzzle games out there.

27379,"Not a bad game by any means, though there are a lot of caveats to that.

So first off, League TD is extremely oldschool style tower defence. Like we're talking Starcraft 1 era maps or earlier, not even Warcraft III era. It's good for what it is in that regard, and if you like those old tower defence style games, it's totally fine for what it is.

So what do I mean by that?

Well, all the towers more or less work the same way with very, very few exceptions. Almost all of them are just ""shoots at a target"" style. Meaning things like poison towers are kind of awful because they'll just shoot a single target over and over, making them pretty bad. There's also the whole status effect immunity thing that a lot of old games had, so of course enemies can be immune to ice (freeze in spot), lightning (slow movement), and poison (damage over time) which further makes these towers not that useful, and after about halfway through the game, every level you go to will have some of each.

There's also of course the flying enemies that are immune to everything but a single tower type and only if you upgrade that tower type with a specific optional upgrade for each individual tower. And invisible enemies that can be detected one at a time by a specific tower type with a specific optional upgrade again as well.

There are no buildings you can place on the track itself, so no mazing, no ""enemies have this effect when you walk over it"" (except one optional upgrade which can draw a weak damage straight line across a lane), and basically just assume that you're looking at the absolutely earliest days of tower defense games in terms of conceptual mechanics.

Now, with that in mind, the towers can be upgraded quite a few times, with each individual tower getting to choose optional upgrades at specific levels, basically as follows:
Level 3: Pick one of 3 stat increases
Level 5: Pick one of 2 special abilities
Level 8: Pick one of 3 with 1 and 2 being upgrades to the level 5 version, 3 being the core tower
Level 10: Pick one of 2 weird things

The thing is, most of these upgrade options do almost nothing. They do let you customize each individual tower, but the customizations aren't that important other than the ability to attack air and invisible enemies. Things like ""do the equivalent of 1 attack's worth of damage as AoE every 5 seconds, but you attack 10 times per second so it's not actually noticeable.""

There's a large tech tree... sort of. Except absolutely everything on the tech tree is locked behind needing to progress past certain levels, and the resources you acquire are rather limited in how they're handed out so the choice is largely an illusion rather than a real choice. It didn't really need to be a tech tree, and there's not much need to grind for resources hardly ever because most of the towers aren't actually useful at all (poison tower for a really obvious example again due to how the game mechanics work), unless you explicitly forgot to purchase the ability to upgrade your new ""can shoot air units"" tower so it can actually, yanno, shoot air... and spent all your resources and are now stuck on a level with air. Fortunately you can just play any given level as many times as you want and it still gives full resource drops each time.

The game has a looooot of levels... 50 of them, in fact. They probably honestly only needed 20, because it mostly drags on after about halfway through where you're not really getting anything particularly new to do and the enemies are more or less the same from that point onward. They keep gradually adding new enemies, but they don't really do anything particularly meaningful. Yes, they have new status effects they can put on your towers, or can put up a shield on themselves, but it doesn't actually change your build any so it's kind of meaningless. It's just longer levels with enemies that have more HP and you get more starting money to spend on more towers. That's about it. If you like that, which you probably do if you're playing this kind of super oldschool tower defense game, then yay, you should be happy with this as it's just an excuse to do more of the same.

The graphics are fine, nothing too special, but it does look nice to see your towers actually being modified with extra guns slapped onto them, the upgrades actually visibly shown and so on. Each group of 10 levels has a different set of new enemies and a different background, each individual level within the group of 10 is a different layout with some unique appearance to it, but it's a tower defense so you're probably not really concerned about eye candy. The attacks are fairly generic, but the sound effects are fairly well done, and fast firing towers actually fire fast which I appreciate.

There are a few issues to consider though other than gameplay.

First, it's a Chinese game. It wasn't fully translated, and there's some pretty notable issues with Engrish here and there. Usually it's fairly clear what they're trying to say, but sometimes it's really not obvious at all. Many of the tooltips, even when set to English, will still be half in Chinese.

The tooltips themselves are also often not very helpful. Not just as translation errors, but because they don't actually cover the information you want to know in the first place. LIke it'll tell you an upgrade increases the range of a tower, but often it won't tell you by how much. You have no idea what the base range or damage of any tower is either, so it's pure guesswork on whether an upgrade is actually worth it or if you'd be better spending your resources or money on something else. This is again, fairly oldschool in setup, so you may be used to this concept already.

There are a number of typos and bugs, such as tower tooltips which were clearly copy/pasted over from another tower and never re-written, or one situation where a tower upgrade to give it anti-air failed to actually attack air units. That was the only gameplay bug I saw though, and it only happened the one time, so it's ""mostly"" bug-free in any meaningful way, but there will be a ton of little, obvious errors all over the place.

There's also the fact that it's a Chinese game, so... they steal stuff. There are direct references to the Zerg, for example. You just kinda expect that from a Chinese game though, they're not really that big on intellectual property laws over there, but if stealing stuff is a deal breaker for you, you should be aware of it.

Otherwise... it's not a bad game. It does absolutely nothing groundbreaking or new. It doesn't even try to do anything new, and suffers from all the problems Tower Defense games circa 2002 had, when WC3 was just new and people were just learning what you could do with them but not what was a good idea to do yet. If this is what you want, it really does have that oldschool TD feel to it, but it doesn't really have anything for modern nicities other than the graphics. It's worth the full $5 CAD that they're asking for I'd say, it's fine even when it's not on sale.

Just, as stated, it will feel OLD. It will feel unpolished, unfinished, but it's not actually legitimately broken in any way.

The closest thing to broken it comes in, is it starts off in Chinese text to begin with, and if you don't read Chinese, then you'll have to guess at each menu option until you see one which has a menu option with a British flag you can click on for changing things (about 3/4, anyway) over to English.

Overall it's fairly solid, if simple, and while it doesn't do anything particularly new, nor does it do anything with any sort of grace or elegance, it does it fairly competently. It's not a bad tower defense game at all, but go in understanding it really wants to be from the first wave of early WC3 TDs, or the last wave of SC1 TDs, and it really isn't going to deviate from that throughout the entire experience. It's about the most generic ""oldschool style TD"" that you will ever see, but it does that well.",1
27380,Its a solid tower defense. There are a few imperfections. Game has to be changed to English by navigating  Chinese menu to settings then clicking on the British flag icon. There are some boss sounds that play even when the sound is turned off. Gawargh!!!! At 3 am blasting full volume is not what I want when im trying to watch shows on another monitor while i play this game.  I like how you get money and stuff to upgrade skill tree even if you die. I appreciate how each tower has a different tower skill chosen at different levels and that they actually make visual and practical changes to the way the tower functions. I like the variety of enemies and stages. Definitely one of the better tower defense games on steam in my opinion for the price point. Have been basically playing it non stop since it came out and I am thoroughly enjoying it. The way they have the tower percentage info for each enemy and their little hints makes it fun trying new strategies to see what works. Its all about one level 10 laser tower with the money generator first. Nice little game with lots of depth.,1
27381,"A quite cheap regular Tower Defense game. It have huge amount of Meta progress. The towers have alot of Upgrades and extra attachments. Game run smoothly. The only downside is not everything translated to english from chinese. Also in first game start you need to find the english language swap (UK banner) in chinese menu. However you cant go wrong with this game, it offer alot of hours gameplay.
Recommened.",1
27382,"Have only played the first 3 levels, but we seem to have a very competently made Tower Defense title.

The cartoon graphics fit well and all the appropriate bells and whistles are there. You will have to think your way through.

Nothing groundbreaking new to the genre, but a well priced title.",1
27383,"I have played a lot of tower defense games, but this one is the cherry on top. It is nearly perfect, only complaint I have is there is too much foreign language in it(I really wished I could read it). Once you get, how this game works, you will be pleasantly surprised :). I will be playing this one for a very long while. It does get crazy as hell, after you get up there in levels, but very manageable. You will be very busy doing something, all the time. But if you need to relax a bit, slow the speed back down to 1 (I play on speed 3). I would have happily paid $20, for this but at $4, it is a true steal, just buy it!! LOVE IT!!!",1
27384,"The devs for League TD have a marketing problem. Let me explain. The video above shows some frantic play with some loud annoying music. The gameplay is engrossing and relaxing. I actually fell asleep at the menu screen because the music was so soothing. This is of course after a nice 3 hour session. Every upgrade for each tower really makes a difference and the visuals show the differences. There is an easy mode which is truly easy. I love League TD. One of the top tier tower defense games that can be played for hundreds of hours, but in reality most will never play. 8/10

Edit: As I venture further, this might be the all time best tower defense of all time. 10/10 (I've played possibly most of them starting out many years ago with Sanctum 2)",1

27388,"Once upon a time, in a quaint little village, there lived a young and adventurous girl named Silly Alice. Known for her playful and mischievous nature, Alice was always seeking new and exciting experiences. One sunny day, she decided to explore the enchanting woods surrounding her village.

As Alice delved deeper into the woods, she could feel an air of mystery and secrecy. The sunbeams peering through the thick foliage created a mesmerizing dance on the forest floor. Unbeknownst to Alice, she was about to stumble upon an extraordinary encounter that would change her life forever.

Suddenly, a peculiar noise broke the silence of the woods. Curiosity piqued, Alice followed the sound until she reached a secluded clearing. To her astonishment, she came face-to-face with a towering ogre named Oswald. With his mossy green skin, bulging muscles, and an intimidating presence, Alice couldn't help but feel a mix of fear and intrigue.

However, Silly Alice was not one to back down from a new adventure. Instead of running away, she approached the ogre cautiously but with a mischievous smile on her face. To her surprise, Oswald reciprocated with a friendly grin, revealing a softer side to his formidable appearance.
They began conversing, exchanging stories and laughter as time flew by. Alice discovered that Oswald was not as fearsome as he seemed. In fact, he was a gentle giant, misunderstood by the villagers due to his daunting appearance. Oswald lamented his solitude in the woods and how he longed for the company of someone who accepted him for who he truly was.

Alice, being the caring and compassionate soul she was, extended her hand in friendship to Oswald. She assured him that appearances meant little to her, focusing instead on the beauty that lay within people's hearts. The ogre's eyes glistened with gratitude and they formed an unlikely duo, embarking on incredible adventures together.

Their adventures were legendary, with Alice's quick wit and Oswald's strength complementing each other perfectly. They journeyed through mystical lands, braved treacherous mountains, and encountered fantastical creatures. Along the way, they both learned valuable lessons about acceptance, friendship, and the power of looking beyond appearances.
Back in the village, rumors of Alice's extraordinary exploits spread like wildfire. Through their courageous acts, Alice and Oswald managed to bridge the gap between humans and magical creatures, fostering a newfound harmony within the community.

And so, the tale of how Silly Alice befriended an ogre in the woods became a beloved story, passed down from one generation to another. It taught people the importance of embracing differences, recognizing the beauty within, and that true friendships could be found in the most unexpected places.

From that day forward, Silly Alice and Oswald the ogre remained inseparable, forever reminding the villagers that the world is full of enchantment if one has the courage to seek it.

  For an extremely short game, a lot of whats described in the scenery, does not match, what is shown to the player.  Even this very short game could have been better, if the author of this game was willing to put in a better effort, and still made this game as short as it is, I could have given this a better review.  There were no choices to make either, just one short linear series of actions, that you followed to the end.

Alice alone walking through the woods and then suddently a huge Ogre appears with a big long dong of a cock whitezilla think 16inch dick. Mystery and suspense into one. All the Ogre wants is to make love to Alice and Alice trys to calm down the Ogre by using words but obviously it did not work out with a conversation. So you know where that ends sex yes. Penetration, and a blow job involve. But I dont want to spoil it however I was disappointed the time it took to finish only like 10 minutes maximum and for the price of $3.99 is not worth it made with Ren'Py a sloppy job a let down poor execution. I thought it would be longer for the price its asking. Get it on sale. I would still give it a thumbs up just because of the graphics and how Alice the woman and Ogre were made and rendered.

The music is very good! I'd love if there were a way to get the soundtrack (checked youtube and soundcloud, and don't know how to extract from Unity resources). I do have some nitpicks, namely:

* there's lots of animation delay on moving, so if I want to go some place fast it's annoying.
* No undo key! Luckily the puzzles are simple enough that I could do without it.
* Some missing settings: Controls rebinding, resolution. Full screen toggle exists but is not documented (it's F4).
* There's some overworld traversal jank - there exists a way to place a junction that the player stops at, but other times there's T and four way junctions that the player flows past in unintuitive ways.
* Some of the puzzles are based on hidden information (priority between two identical things, elements not visible in the starting configuration) or have an annoyance (a long traversal time between two parts of the puzzle), but the puzzles are few and short enough in number that I could get over it.

-Side by Size is a a minimalist logic puzzle game that packs quite a punch.  This game is a little rough around the edges, but it makes up for it w/ over 120 well designed, challenging, and innovative levels.  There are a handful of mechanics that build upon each other as well as a good amount of secrets to be found.  The UI isn't pretty, their is a slight bit of input delay, and their are a couple of odd difficulty spikes (there are a handful of very difficult levels between 50-60 and then most of the rest of the game is quite a bit easier imo).  Fortunately, I can easily overlook all of this b/c this game is an absolute steal at $5.

Consensus:
-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  I completed 90% of the game before giving up.  This game has a couple of really tricky, creative, and thought provoking levels.  In fact, I took a break for about 3 months b/c I was stumped by two of the levels around level 60, before coming back and finishing most of the rest of the game.

27456,"I would not say it's a badly made graphic adventure, but there was just not enough of a kick to the narrative, if there was some hidden meaning behind it I don't think it translated on my end, I am not sure if it's just lack of experience, but I felt the story was just too primitive. Honestly with the game being 15 minutes or less, if you just gave me like another 10 minutes of context for both characters, it would probably make the difference between a negative review and a positive one.

It has some dark vibes so I thought the plot would go interesting places, but there are only a few characters, and not one of them is explored in any meaningful capacity. To be honest I am not even sure what you were trying to say at the ending, it just seemed like 2 people frustrated with life, that is pretty much all I got from it, that seems to be the extent of their relationship, either that or you failed to convey your intentions. I am not even trying to nitpick the story, you could keep it the way it is, but you just need more time with the characters, give them a bit more background or just add a few layers to the plot leading up to the ending, I don't mind short games but this is a good example of a game that needed more time with the character, perhaps a few extra panels would help.

The game can be completed in 10 to 15 minutes with no prior knowledge, The correct path only has about 5 minutes of dialogue, but the choice-based progression makes it a bit longer, plus there are a few optional achievements. Your partner randomly goes missing and you have to repeat the same day to find the ""correct sequence"" of events to save her in time, so there is a bit of trial and error with the choices.

I actually love these deducting games where you have to avoid dead ends, not many people do, but it reminds me of those classic text adventures, I kinda of dig them personally. I like that you had a few optional events, but I would like to see you expand on them if you make another game, just add 1 or 2 extra acts, maybe a few optional endings as well. I do think you would benefit taking more risk with the story, it's okay to have a simple plot sometimes, but if you take no risk, there is no reward, and while I didn't hate the game, you didn't even give me much to work with which is somewhat frustrating.

While I do think you picked a decently moody song for the game, I would recommend thinking about game music in a form of manipulation and complementing the scene instead of playing the same song over the game, you could try slowing it down or slightly modifying it for different locations or perhaps even changing it entirely if the dialogue calls for silence or something more subtle and atmospheric. I didn't mind the visuals, the only thing I would say is because the actual scenes didn't have much going in them,  I don't think that you made it very compelling to explore, I think you need to give yourself more opportunities to create interesting imagery in the game. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Now I can't say that there was any part of the game that I really liked, but I think you have the basic format down, I like having those optional outcomes like the path talking to the school friend over and over. You not doing anything wrong, just need more layers to the experience. I liked that dark atmosphere and the look of the game, but even there I think you needed to do a bit more mood progression to make it compelling

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Just some thoughts: [/u] - not to repeat myself, but like already mentioned, I just don't think you doing enough with the plot, you need more scenes to develop the characters and give more weight to the narrative. I don't mind the art but I also think you need the plot to give you more opportunities to draw more interesting scenes in that art style. For music, even if you have one song, you could try slowing down or changing the pitch a little between different locations.

That and honestly just make the game a bit longer, even if you make something decent you just never going to get much across in 10 minutes.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 5/10 [/b]

It's not a bad game but the story just didn't have enough of a kick to it, sometimes you can get away with something simple, but even then I think you need to provide more details for the reader to care about the plot. I was somewhat compelled to find her, I will play almost any game with a dark atmosphere, but you really didn't reward my time. I think you got the basic format down, just need to focus more on the characters and add more context for the plot. Give yourself more opportunities to come up with interesting locations to draw, take more risk with the story.

27457,"""It is what it is"" is the first thought that comes to mind.

In short, no spoilers, you learn this within the first 2-3 minutes and this info sets you up for the rest of the game: your friend sent some peculiar texts that hint that something not very good has happened or is going to happen, and no one knows where she is. Her parents have called the police but otherwise they're not really that bothered and take no responsibility. A friend at school spoke to her just before the disappearance but is reluctant to give you any information other than what you already know. Why would she hide things from [i]me[/i] of all people?
You keep doing the same things over & over in a cursed time-loop. How can you make it stop? How can you find her?

It's a nice enough little narrative adventure. The concept that you re-live the same day over and over can make it a bit repetitive but enough new things happen to not burn you out and it is of course quite short, but it isn't offensively priced.

I really like the art-style and colour-palette, atmospherically it fits really well and the map mechanic and time-loop concept proves that this developer is able to be a bit creative and unique. It's not another identical visual novel narrative made in the same way as all the others.

I wouldn't say the story is amazing but I wouldn't say it is horrid either, I don't know... I found it a bit weak and not as hard-hitting as I wished for & I found the main character to be a little aggressive and irrational, I was not a big fan of that.
Again, [i]it is what it is[/i]: a mediocre little game where a [i]Mixed[/i] rating would be more appropriate than a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down.
It's this developers first game and it is a fairly strong start for what the game is, [i]practice makes perfect[/i] as they say, and they proved that they are able to do some of their own thing and think outside the box in terms of how the game is paced.

It feels as if people so often expect and demand a life-changing experience from anything they play nowadays when it is a story game, set your exceptions in a more realistic place. And if you're not willing to pay 2$ for an as-advertised short game then don't buy it.
It is pathetic how many people give games negative reviews for literally no other reason than it being short when that is made very clear in all reviews and written very clearly on the store page to indeed be the reality of the situation.

27458,"Overall, for what it is, it's a neat little game. The two-color palette is pretty oppressive and really helps the tone of the game come across. The ending felt like it conveyed what it wanted to, and I enjoyed it.

The writing is very..... utilitarian. There really isn't much to it, every conversation flowed a little unnaturally and very much felt like a way to get you from point A to B to C. The narration suffered from this too, its definitely readable, it just feels a little..... clunky. Lots of ""tell"", not a lot of ""show"". I completed the game on the second try and felt no real need to hunt for the other achievements because I wasn't sure if there was a real point to searching the world for alternate paths. Stronger writing and better prose would have probably helped this.

But, for it's price point its a neat little experience. I'm glad I played it",1
27459,"[i]Meet Her There[/i] is dark-themed visual novel developed and published by Sinisthesis.  You take on the role of an unnamed teenage (or perhaps, slightly older) female who ends up receiving a strange text from her girlfriend.  The text implies [spoiler]suicide[/spoiler], which, of course, alarms the MC.  Thus, she hurries to various locations to find her girlfriend and stop her before it's too late.  That's the basic story premise, and I'll stop here to avoid spoilers and all that.

As for the gameplay, you're presented with a map of the city, and various locations are marked where the MC can visit in search of her girlfriend, or at least, any information as to her whereabouts.  In each location, you'll get one of two choices as to what the MC should do.  Thus, the gameplay continues like that until you either get the ending where the MC is too late to save her girlfriend or you get the true ending.  Unlike a lot of visual novels, no CGs are present.  However, there are Steam achievements, but they won't count towards a user's global total until the game is out of ""Steam is learning about this game"".

Now that I've gone over the story and gameplay, I'll move onto my thoughts.  [i]Meet Her There[/i] stood out to me because of how different it is from a lot of visual novels out there, so I decided to give this a try.  Before I get ahead of myself too much, though, I'll first comment on the story.  Right away, I could tell that the story atmosphere is meant to detect some imminent danger when the MC receives that ominous text from her girlfriend.  Along with the art and music, I definitely get that feeling.  Understandably, the MC is in a panic, so she searches in several places to find her.  In regards to the MC, I found her to be hot tempered (but that is understandable due to the situation), but it's obvious that she deeply cares for her girlfriend and wants to save her.  As to the various characters the MC meets, their personalities and temperaments vary.  While the girlfriend's friend at school is a nice enough, friendly character who can tell that the MC wants to find her girlfriend (yet, she is conflicted because she was made to promise not to give the MC any clues as to where the girlfriend might be), the girlfriend's parents are hostile, attacking and blaming the MC for their daughter being the way that she is.  It's implied that [spoiler]the girlfriend might have been a guy, but that's only if you carefully read a certain line of text[/spoiler].  As to the story's true ending, this is where conflicting views come into play.  As I played this visual novel after the Steam update, I'm getting a slightly different perspective from those who played it before the update.  Without going into spoiler territory, all I'll say is that it left me feeling [spoiler]sorry for the MC, but the reality is that she would have never been able to stop her girlfriend from committing suicide[/spoiler].

Regarding the writing, I found it to be passable.  I didn't notice any typos although it's definitely on the short side.  The pacing is fine since the story itself takes place within a span of a few hours (probably).  As for the gameplay, I liked the map presentation and the concept of a time loop.  Thus, if you reach an ending where the MC is too late to save her girlfriend, you'll get taken back to the start of the story and have to make slightly different choices as you aim towards getting the true ending.  All the Steam achievements unlocked for me without any problems, and they're pretty easy to figure out how to obtain (for the most part).

As for the art, I like the style that is used.  It's in a pixelated style with red and black colors being the primary colors.  Combined, it helps give off that dark, intense, scared feeling, which is probably what the developer intended.  In regards to the music, there are only a few tracks.  However, the tracks that are present, like the art style, give off that dark, intense, scared feeling as well, setting the atmosphere adequately.

Overall, would I recommend [i]Meet Her There[/i]?  For the developer's first game, I think it's adequate.  I would give this a neutral rating, but since Steam doesn't have that option, I'll give it a positive.  The story execution could have been better even though I believe the update makes the story's message a little clearer.  I would have liked for there to have been CGs, but I can see why that might not have been possible.  For the asking price, I'd say that if you want to give this a try, it's best to wait for a sale.  It took me a little over 30 minutes to obtain all of the achievements and get the true ending.

27460,"Good game, short but sweet. I immediately clued in on all the themes, and the game managed to land them. The small twist in the ending was very well done.",1
27461,"it's short, the graphics are really good, the music fits well, the narrative isn't too deep, but, i think for it's length its ok. i'd recommend playing it in one sitting.",1
27462,"Very short game. Sprite work looks great, I liked the art a lot and it being in two colours actually works really well. The game's a bit of a puzzle to figure out where to go next, which was actually pretty fun to work out. Still, it didn't take long to figure out.

Story's very short and surface-level, like others have said I would've liked it if at least the two main characters were fleshed out a bit more. Other than that decent game for a decent price.",1
27463,"Overall, it's a good time for the price.

Short, music is wonderful and adds to the experience tenfold, graphics are unique although and the aesthetic is nice although I don't get why that aesthetic was chosen for this sort of story, interesting story although it seems to lack any type of deeper meaning and did not evoke the emotion of the game. Definitely an ""interactive visual novel"" because it's really a walk-around-until-you-stumble-into-the-right-path kind of game. That's not in a bad way, I love those sorts of games. can be finished and 100%'d in 1.1 hours.",1
27464,"A lovely little adventure. I absolutely love the atmosphere of this game. Nostalgic and mysterious. The main character only has one goal:  meet her. And to me, the game did not need to be about anything else. It is exactly what is promised. However, you can find a lot of other things and themes as well, if you keep your eyes open. For the price, amazing.",1
27465,"Short but incredibly atmospheric game with amazing music and beautiful pixel-art graphics. If you like dramatic stories that will make you cry at the end - this game is for you. Also, this game is for you, if you are a fan of retro aesthetics. It is worth the time and money spent on it.",1

27470,"I bought the game with the intention to try it out, played it for about 20 minutes, and immediately felt the need to write a review.

Here are my recommendations, but I can say that the game is definitely worth buying, and it has a lot of potential.

What I really liked:

Even though there were some aspects that took me a while to grasp in my initial experience, it gives a pleasant feeling.
We feel a sense of empowerment, which is very satisfying.
The combat mechanics provide a lot of enjoyment.
The perks and blacksmithing system are quite enjoyable, and the constant sense of progression is a lot of fun.
The visuals are impressive and look very charming.
Would be nice to have:

Some mechanics aren't perfectly polished, but they aren't too bothersome.
Sometimes, I find myself searching for enemies on the map, and it would be great to receive a reward or information when I've cleared the last 1 or 2 enemies. A few times, I kept looking for enemies even though I'd completed the map.
Traveling on the map is nice initially, but it feels long when you want to return to spend diamonds.""
I hope this translation is helpful for your review!",1
27471,"It's in early access and I've encountered some bugs, but none of those ruined my game. I had a lot of fun playing the game. At the beginning, I wondered if it might be a bit challenging, but I got used to it over time. It's not a game where you can just rush through all the enemies; you have to use tactics based on the type of enemy you're facing. For example, there's an enemy that shoots lasers; I retreat when it shoots, then I attack when it stops, and then retreat again.
I don't know if it's due to early access, but there was a sword that hits really well, but it slows me down as a perk. There was also a skill in the game that increases my walk speed, when I used it together, I was able to walk my normal speed and I started hitting really well.
The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is very fun to play. For now, the gameplay time is short, but it's a game worth its price.",1
27472,"I haven't had the opportunity to play much, but I'll update it again after writing the first impression.

27544,"A surprisingly fun and lighthearted platformer. It's very much on the sillier side of things, and is only a couple of hours long, but there's something to be said for games which you can pick up and play through in a single session.

In terms of gameplay, the frequent checkpoints double as a fast travel system so it's easy to get around the world and back to where you were if you die. The regular platforming is also quite forgiving, but there are a couple of notably harder spots which may require repeated attempts (the cars near the start, and the ducks at the lake).

Definitely worth checking out if you have a couple of hours to kill, especially given that it's free.

     [*] The game consists of five books, each tells a folktale through eight chapters / puzzles.

     [*] It's like a children's book (or five), simplified even more and made into a fun and interactive game.

     [*] Once you complete any of the puzzles, you can change the color of any of the stained glass pieces!  

     [*] Further more, you can directly save your new customized art work as a wallpaper for your desktop! I haven't removed mine since I first put it up; too cute!

     [*] 40 puzzles in total, so plenty to do.

     [*] Beautiful visuals
Very pleasant to look at.

     [*] Immersive music
Plenty of classical Christmas tunes play back to back in the in the background with nice fading. 

     [*] Nice sound effects
The searing sound of a glass piece being welded into place never gets old for me! Very satisfying.
[/list]

[h3]Pros[/h3]
[list]
     [*] Polished and smooth gameplay
Only one bug in my 10 hours of play time. Otherwise, my experience has been stellar.

     [*] Very relaxing
I really needed that and this game scratched that itch. 

     [*] Satisfying gameplay
It's a nice feeling when you're done with a puzzle and just look at it for a moment. This beauty? Yes, you helped make it complete.

     [*] Replayability 
The ability to select your own choice of colors to completely reimagine any puzzle adds a unique feature and possibly a few extra hours of fun when done together with your children or nephews and nieces. 

     [*] Fitting for the season 
[/list]

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[list]
     [*] One bug: 
When you move a piece out of the deck below and then return it there (because it didn't fit), it makes the furthest piece to the right in the deck go out of view, rendering it unseen and un-selectable. Here's a demonstration.

[h3] Quality of Life Suggestions [/h3]
[list]
     [*] Maybe make the stained glass pieces stick together outside of the picture?
Right now, even if the pieces fit together, they won't join unless within the frame. I understand this very well might be a game design choice.
Example: 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112041945
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112042130

     [*] Show the name of each book and chapter at the start of its puzzle, and feature the complete non-colored puzzle; both as a center-screen popup message of sorts. This will make for a more coherent and immersive experience for the stories.
     
    [*] Add the ability to pick which Christmas music is playing. 
I can name two indie games that I've played recently that do this (Voyager and Wound Man) and it's really helpful because we can skip to the ones we like the most or avoid a track that keeps playing too many times. 

[*] Is it possible to add vocals to the music? Can it be done without violating any copyright laws?
[/list]

[h3]Achievements[/h3]
[list]
     [*] Total: 14
     [*] Very straightforward
     [*] Perfect Game? Not yet but it certainly has all the potential in the world to give that. 
[/list]

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Highly recommended!
This is an affordable game that fits Christmas perfectly. 
I don't believe I've played any Christmas-themed game that comes even close.  

[h3]Guide? Not really. Just a cozy read [/h3]
I created a guide for the game. It's more of a cozy read with a hot cup of cocoa in hand really xD

In [i]Stories in Glass: Winter[/i] you play through five books that each tell a winter tale. The stories are The Fir Tree, The Snow Queen, Elves & the Shoemaker, Visit St. Nicholas and the beloved story The NutCracker. You can play any book in any order with each book having 8 chapters. 

[h3]Gameplay & Features[/h3]

The settings in the game are very basic, audio control and resolution options. As well as language selection. 

Game play is piecing together mosaics like a jigsaw puzzle. 

[i]Strengths[/i]

* In-game hints that recharge fast. 
* The music is festive. A collection of instrumental Christmas melodies that are relaxing and certainly suit the theme of the game. 
* Easy to obtain achievements, just play & enjoy the game. 
* The puzzles DO auto-save so you can back out and go back in with your progress saved. 

[i]Special Features[/i]

One thing that this game does have which is cool is once you complete a puzzle you can paint or recolor elements in the puzzle. Once done you can make it a wallpaper. 

[i]Shortcomings[/i]

* You can only change resolution from the main menu and not during game-play (hitting quit will bring you back to the main menu (not quit out of the game).
* The pieces do not rotate. Simply pick them up, find their spot and it will click into place. 
* No difficulty options. 
* When you're piecing together the puzzle there is no image to reference as to what the complete picture should look like.  
* The pieces are, for the most part, grouped together. Making it very easy to assemble sections. 
* Hints do not place random pieces, it always takes them from the first piece in the lineup. 

[h3]Overall Experience[/h3]

This game is certainly festive with beautiful illustrations to get you into the mood for the holidays. However what it offers is too basic and too easy for those looking for any type of challenge. The pieces are grouped together so there is no trying to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the next piece, they are next to each other. Assembly becomes very easy once you notice this. There are no difficulty options, no rotation of the pieces and no real challenge. 

I will say however this game is perfect for the young ones. They are probably not going to notice the lack of difficulty and the colorful illustrations combined with the music, re-coloring options and festive spirit will certainly delight them.

 [i]I recommend this game for a younger audience and on sale[/i].

I have played several games similar to Stories in Glass: Winter, where you grab a puzzle fragment and place it on the board correctly. I've always loved the concept but hated the fact that they were all timed games that forced you to place fragments at a break-neck pace, God forbid, should you place a piece incorrectly! I'm a puzzle geek; puzzles are my zen and should be relaxing...x unless you're about to enter the World Puzzle Championship!

27562,"Relaxing puzzle where you restore images while listening to Christmas tunes.

Here‚Äôs something different from Tiny Little Lion studio. After several series of old-school and casual HOG games, here comes the equally casual puzzle game where you reconstruct glass windows. As always, there‚Äôs no need to worry about quality or content because they always deliver.

The game is divided into five chapters or books, and each book has eight puzzles. Although it would be a good idea to play them in order and follow the story, you can play any puzzle you want. The story is just a one or two sentences after you finish the puzzle, so it might not be that important to you. 

Each puzzle starts with some of the pieces already placed. The rest of the pieces are found on the bar at the bottom. There‚Äôs room for only so many, but you can freely scroll between them and look for those you want. The best way to start a puzzle is to look for pieces with straight sides. This means there‚Äôs a good change they fit somewhere around the edges. Or you can look for pieces with unique shape.

Regardless of your approach, you simply need to click on the piece and drop it on the correct spot or somewhere on the playing field. When a piece is placed on the right spot, it will get ‚Äúglued‚Äù and won‚Äôt be able to move again. But if the spot is wrong, you can either click and drag it around to a new spot or drop it back at the bottom to keep the screen clean. 

Once you understand the concept, solving a puzzle is very easy. The thing is that pieces are usually placed at the bottom in such an order that allow you to fill up the image without worrying where the pieces go. In other words, the first pieces is often connected to the second piece, second to the third, and so on. 

It‚Äôs a bit shame there aren‚Äôt any extras or bonuses. The only other feature is that you can change the color of completed image or completely repaint it according to your wishes.",1
27563,"Puzzle game for family, mainly for children. Although as an adult I have a lot of fun. Great music! Perfect while waiting for Christmas. It would be nice to add more chapters.",1
27564,"A chill puzzle game with stained glass, nice sounds, and good holiday music.  This one is a win.",1

ATTENTION ! this game has a big BUG!
I installed the game, and tried it for about half an hour, the next day I wanted to continue but it doesn't work anymore!
There is no way to start it, I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but nothing DOESN'T WORK!

I reported the problem in the discussions, but no one is interested, I don't understand why they give the game to try and then completely ignore it!

I would have liked to play it, I hope some developer makes it usable, and I will change the review.
But for now I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT!!!!

27568,"[h1]GOOD VARIETY OF CHILL GAMES[/h1]
The Just Find It series has a hodgepodge of puzzles that are easy-breezy and relaxing. However, I will say that I found some of these to be quite challenging because of the intricate designs and patterns chosen.

Several of the puzzle variations have a hidden Lion mascot available, as indicated by the Lion Emblem on the bottom corner, as well as on the puzzle's icon. They are really fun to search for because each one is slightly different.¬†¬†

There are seven categories:¬†
‚Ä¢Click To Cycle (2)-click on various shaped pieces to create the correct picture.
‚Ä¢Difference (32)-spot the differences between two or more scenes.
‚Ä¢Detail (55)-search for areas in each scene that match the swatch.
‚Ä¢Match (6)-find identical pairs of various objects. (Butterflies was my fav!)
‚Ä¢Memory (3)-flip over two cards at a time to find matching pictures (I would love more of these!)
‚Ä¢Montage(12)-find objects that match a portion of the image.
‚Ä¢Swap (3)-swap shaped pieces between images.

Collector's Edition Extras:
14 Music Soundtracks, 15 Wallpaper, 2 bonus levels of Click To Cycle, 8 bonus levels of Differences, 7 bonus levels of Detail. 2 bonus levels of Match, 1 bonus level of Memory, 4 bonus levels of Montage, and 1 bonus level of Swap.

27570,"Casual mini-games that won‚Äôt overstay their welcome.

This is a compilation of seven different kinds of mini-games. It's a shame that at least half of the mini-games feature only a handful of puzzles, but the collector's edition fixes this by adding a few more to each category.

The focus is primarily on identifying differences and matching pieces to the image. These two mini-games have a lot more puzzles. The game is casual because you can't fail and there's no penalty for randomly clicking. You also have a hint that recharges after a while.

Puzzles can be sorted by type or all. The option to filter out puzzles you've already solved is absent. Although completed puzzles are marked with a checkmark, adding an additional filter would make it much easy to find them.

Collectibles are added to puzzles to make them more interesting. These take the form of a lion, which is hidden somewhere in the puzzle. Puzzles with lions have an icon next to them so you can see if you missed it. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no reward for finding them all.",1
27571,"Ok pretty fun, and while i still recommend, I still have critiques, which are expected for a first game

First:The copyright issue resolved itself

Now for other critiques,

The controller controls are pretty decent, so I just used keyboard and mouse(half fixed, tutorial explains them, however the crosshair stills moves weirdly, which might just be a me thing)
Some levels look a bit similar
Text has to fully appear before other text can in shops and menus, which can be annoying, especially since it moves a bit slowly(its faster now



Now for things that can‚Äôt just be patched out













The game is pretty short, I could 100% refund it if I wanted, although I don‚Äôt think I will
The game can be pretty easy at times

I‚Äôm not just going to be negative though, so for some positives

The game has a decently funny story
It has a nice artstyle(I like how Jason‚Äôs drawings are mostly references to strings like undertale and breaking bad(yes the meth show))
It can have fun music
The finale was decently challenging

All in all, this is a first game, and everyone‚Äôs gotta start somewhere, only way to go is up!",1

27576,"Xonix Casual Edition is a free mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as a paid product to scam PC gamers.  As if it was a real PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs.  This mobile app is an unabashed, lazy ripoff of Qix (Copyright Taito Inc, 1981).  Many lazy ""amateur"" developers don't pay attention to their obligations under copyright law, and often steal the ideas of actual, real game developers without credit, such as the ""developer"" here has done.  At this stage no legal action has been taken by Taito Inc against the ""developer"" here, but it's never off the table, as previous copyright law cases have shown.

Putting aside the unethical intellectual bankruptcy of stealing someone else's game concept for profit, this is also breaking that unwritten law of stealing other people's game ideas... you should at least try to do better than the game you're ripping off.  Xonix Casual Edition is considerably worse than Qix.  Sure, it's 3D rendered (badly) but there's nothing new or interesting about it.  And the fact it's a ripoff is blatant.  I had to go make sure HapGames wasn't some subsidiary of Taito or something, but they're not.  In fact they branded this mobile app on the app stores as ""Qix: Xonix Edition"".  Yeah, they're even ripping off the trademark as well as the rest of the IP.  And that's probably our first of many reasons not to buy this... because it's blatant copyright infringement, it's likely this will get booted off Steam as soon as Taito finds out what's going on. 

From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The mobile app features low-polygon ""retro"" assets with cartoony, mobile app style shader effects, making this look like a barely functional mobile app from 15 years ago.  This visual style is a method that lazy devs often use when they have a lack of interest/capabilty to create highly detailed, high poly models and instead use shader effects to disguise that shortcoming under the name of ""art"", or ""We made it look bad on purpose"", which really isn't something gamers should have to put up with.  It's unclear why the developers weren't willing to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets and high resolution textures for the mobile app.  It's far below the state of the art visuals gamers expect as a result of their decisions.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the mobile app unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.

These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this mobile app is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality mobile app is to be expected.

So, should you buy this mobile app?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this mobile app as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the mobile app (to date).  Until this status changes, this mobile app will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this mobile app.[/quote]

Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $7 USD, on app stores, it's free. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

27587,"First off, as someone who utterly adores this game and wanted nothing more than for this DLC to be an ancient relics 2.0, it brings me great pain to say that this is genuinely the only Stellaris DLC I go out of my way to disable. The rifts are interesting, and the relics are cool, but if i'm being honest the entire thing feels like a badly made mod.

I don't say this lightly mind you, we've had our fair share of bad paradox DLCs here, but the fact that half the new relics are either game-breakingly strong and/or blatant power creep on existing relics (and not even in an interesting way) combined with the fact that ""azilash"" (lower case intentional unfortunately) and all the content related to it feels cheap at best and actively detrimental at worst. It leaves a sour taste in my mouth unlike any DLC paradox have put out before.

I could spend far longer here ranting about the poor decisions made when developing this DLC and I haven't even touched on the fact that it was marketed as a full blown expansion. Suffice to say, I wouldn't buy this DLC again. 

TL;DR: Play with mods, there are objectively better mods on the workshop for exactly the content this DLC was meant to provide with far less random baggage tagged on.",0
27588,"To be frank, I'm not sure what my money has paid for; this is a full priced expansion but it compares poorly to the smaller story packs. It's a shame, because the narrative content itself is actually quite good and I have enjoyed it - but there's so little of substance to warrant it being the most expensive full priced expansion.

The 'Astral Plane' mechanics essentially boil down to a new type of Archaological Site that require a tech to access, a series of boons that function in a similar way to Relics, and a new resource type 'Astral Thread' obtained through research stations to purchase them with... and that's it?

Outside of the mechanics, there's a new Origin, a couple of Civics, and a few new species portraits that for some reason are low resolution compared to the existing ones.

As it stands, I'd have trouble recommending this at the current price to anyone. If it were reduced in price to match the other Story Packs, then I might suggest it for the more hardcore Stellaris fan, but even then it's a bit of a stretch.

Edit: Apparently people haven't realised, but this is DLC, which is why it shows as zero hours. I have played nearly 1000 hours of Stellaris at this point and own all the DLC. I have deleted the comments calling this a 'fake review'.",0
27589,"[b]""Astral Planes = Archaeology 2.0""[/b]

The main feature of this DLC is a recycled, reskinned, redundant mechanic from the older Ancient Relics DLC.

Advertised as something new to explore like the L-Cluster from the Distant Stars DLC, instead the Astral Rifts are only a series of textbox events with arbitrary choices, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

Most of the time, you only gain more of a new resource, the Astral Threads. This resource has no purpose outside of a few unlockables and buffs during the early game; though eventually you find yourself startled by yet another permanent ""Resource Storage Full"" alert, because this resource cannot be sold or traded.



The DLC also came with a forced ""free update"" which ruined the few positive elements of the previous Paragon DLC, by making leaders largely useless and frustrating through changing their roles, nerfing or replacing the useful traits with useless ones.

While you can choose to simply not buy this DLC, you cannot opt out of the free update branch.
The lead development of Stellaris is not doing a good job anymore. Avoid.",0
27590,Higher prices with less content. And why are the new portraits so low-res compared to existing species? Is Paradox trying to pull a CA here?,0
27591,"Something I sorta bite the bullet on cuz I'm the host of most of our MP campaigns, so in principle I typically buy all the DLC so my friends don't have to.

That said, the vague description of the actual DLC should have been warning enough, as well as the closing of departments and this rather strange pricing.  I love you Paradox and I love Stellaris, but just with CA and Total War, we can't encourage this practice.

Stay away.",0
27592,"I have some 1300 hours in Stellaris since 2020. I have all DLC and delayed buying this due to the price point mainly and being out of work :/. I play typical single player, on larger galaxies and don't move the mid or end game around and treat each game as a campaign over several sessions. My games maybe last 6-12 hours.

There's purpose in this DLC, it's not meant to show up in the early game unless you take a set origin and you might feel underwhelmed about that at first, I was. What it does do later on is give you rifts that spawn like a dig site, beautiful purple, blues, reds and pinks and you have to divert resources to know enough about the first rift to actually then do anything with it. 

After this, you can allocate a scientist. Unlike dig sites and anomalies there is no right click or automation for this(yet?). One weird aspect about this is, the leader screen to select a scientist will be empty unless a free scientist is crewing a ship. There, they will fly to it and begin exploring it and will unfurl a story and there you make actual choices of how the story goes. These stories are a bit more, in my opinion - deeper, than most most / all other sites and thats something some people will enjoy more than others.

As you finish exploring a rift, you can make use of the Discoveries screen and each successive rift explored enables you to use your growing amount of Astral Threads towards unique activations. They function like relics, some with limited uses, others with long ""cool downs"". A lot of those activation's are useful or even super-awesome but they are not game-upsetting either.

This DLC also comes with three new music tracks and they are nice but maybe not quite up to the same standard of Stellaris that I'm use to, there is a high bar there though.

This DLC does add more relics to the game but i can't comment on those yet; My purchase was based around more stories, a deeper aspect to the mid game and yeah, that's what I got. 

[Post-edit] Seems the AI does use rifts too, so thats cool. Also you can automate rift exploration with science ships, I either didn't notice or maybe its a dynamic menu (probably the former!).

For those that rush the game and bring down those mid / end game years and zerg the AI or even play competitive MP(which are by in large, short games too), you could be forgiven for skipping this DLC as you might find them a chore but for me, I like the flavour this adds and wets my whistle and adds to the mid game where a lot of people complain ""not enough happens"".",1
27593,"Get this on sale. This is a good DLC, but Paradox missed the mark on pricing. 

Rifts are an innovation on archaeology sites. Each features a series of branching decisions with impactful rewards, often beyond a lump of resources. It's clear Paradox saw an opportunity to flesh out existing game mechanics with this DLC and took it. That was a great decision. 

Astral Planes offers less content than an expansion, but far more than a species pack. It showcases Stellaris' storytelling capability while fleshing out some mechanics introduced in earlier updates. It's not quite worth $20, but definitely worth adding to the game.",1
27594,"For the price of $19.99, you get 3 civics, an origin, and a re-skin of archaeology sites. Don't waste your money on this and get some mods instead.",0
27595,"I'm beginning to feel as though I'm interacting an enterprise application rather than enjoying the game I once loved. The constant pop-ups completely disrupt the immersive experience. I believe Paradox should consider developing Stellaris 2, where pop-ups are replaced by advisors (or leaders) who communicate with us directly about the situation.",0
27596,"Astral Planes is a good story-pack, it adds intresting content, extremly powerfull new relics, astral rifts have cool lore, and the events are quite fine (great job writers). Civics and Origin are also quite cool, but nothing special. My main issue with the DLC is pricing, it's too expensive, and adds relativly little new content. That's why i can only reccomend it to people who already have most/all DLCs and have some spare money they would spend on ciggarets or booze.

TLDR. - DLC is great, but WAAAY too expensive",0
27597,"I‚Äôm never quite sure how to judge downloadable content, in part because I‚Äôm never sure what‚Äôs fair to expect from it. Complete overhauls with entirely new mechanics can be fun and valuable, but if every additional release had these, the game would never feel stable enough to bother mastering. Likewise, I‚Äôm happy to see updated graphics, but if a release were to include only a few new menu screens, no matter how attractive, I‚Äôd be disappointed. Reviewing Stellaris: Astral Planes is one of those times I wish Steam ratings offered more granularity than simply ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù or not. At the moment, this DLC is a 7.5/10 for me, which is passing.

Let me start with the price: the DLC was released at $19.99 and is currently $17.99. I truthfully don‚Äôt know how to think about game value vs. monetary value. I‚Äôm in the fortunate position to be able to buy games as I want them. I don‚Äôt have to make hard calls about how to spend my money. Do I know what else I could get for $20? Of course. But I also know that I‚Äôve been okay with spending well more than that on a night out. At least this downloadable content is available to me permanently, not enjoyed and then flushed away.

In a recent patch note, Stellaris‚Äôs devs referred to Astral Planes as a ‚Äúnarrative expansion.‚Äù As I‚Äôll show below, that phrasing is apt: the DLC is more story than mechanics, more exploration than challenge. Could the developers have included content? Of course. Could this release have been cheaper? Sure. But I haven‚Äôt experienced any bugs, and I‚Äôm having fun. That‚Äôs basically all I want from the games I buy. I recognize that other players have other, perhaps more demanding, desires from their purchases.

I also realize that my way of playing Stellaris isn‚Äôt the same as everyone else‚Äôs. To be clear: I‚Äôm not someone who plays Stellaris for the blobbing. I enjoy building up my borders and seeing my naval cap increase, but I find the game‚Äôs warfare unremarkable. Sure, it‚Äôs a delight to watch sparkly lasers and exploding ships, but the military side is tedious. Astral Planes doesn‚Äôt add much to the game‚Äôs combat. There are new active and passive buffs and maybe some novel technology. Fine, whatever, ho-hum, shrug.

What I love in Stellaris is the exploration. At each game‚Äôs start, there could be just about anything out there, only a little beyond sensor range. My science ships head out, undoing my ignorance with every scan, and I‚Äôm rewarded with a host of planets, resources, and pop-up events and stories. These mysteries, tales, and discoveries bring seemingly empty space to life, and though I‚Äôve seen most of them before, I still read each one in full‚Äîusually aloud. I imagine the settings, events, and characters. And the hours of play tick by.

This DLC is clearly meant for someone like me. It includes are new events, a story-driven origin, and a new exploration system. The last of these is modeled on the earlier archaeology mechanic, which allows players to discover the history of their universe. The new system, accessed through attractively bright tears in space, instead gives insight to the history and present of other universes. One advance on the earlier archaeological system is how the DLC‚Äôs astral delving stories present choices. Archaeological events happened mostly on-rails, step-wise through, with occasional hidden rolls to determine outcomes. Astral Planes' events lets the player decide: Will you help the other worldly beings? Will you run at the first sign of danger? Each of these choices comes with an explicit difficulty marker, similar to the current espionage system. They can fail, sometimes disastrously. But these decision prompts remind me of my favorite childhood books: Choose Your Own Adventure.

I‚Äôm hopeful this release heralds future DLCs with substantial narrative content. Even if they‚Äôre not everyone‚Äôs favorites, they‚Äôre mine.

27600,"The DLC is fun and definitely a worthwhile addition to the game, but at this price point? Absolutely not. I don't know what the developers are smoking, but it must be some strong stuff. I do not recommend only at this price point, wait for a 50% off sale and you are good to go.",0
27601,It's the archaeology DLC for twice the price and half the stuff.,0
27602,With the release of this DLC they almost completely broke the game. The amount of content you get with this is NOT worth the price. Wait for it to go on sale if you must have it.,0
27603,"Fool me into buying overpriced DLC once, shame on you. Fool me into buying overpriced DLC 19 times or more, shame on me.",1
27604,"Offensively bad. It's just midgame archaeology sites you need to set your science ships to explore, and a set of ""Astral actions"" that are mostly the same as relics and constantly pop up asking you to activate them. It's annoying and just another thing to micromanage rather than something that lets you take your empire in a new direction.",0
27605,"This DLC was clearly not play tested properly - there are a number of obvious bugs with bonuses (e.g. reduction in costs) not actually being applied.  They've already released one hotfix to allow to to be usable (at all) for some users; I suspect there will be more, but it's disappointing to see such obvious issues.  It also doesn't really seem to add that much depth, though I keep getting frustrated by the bugs (should I give a leader this trait that doesn't work or that trait that they can't actually use) and quitting a run.

It may be much better with a patch or three, but this is a pretty frustrating release.",0
27606,"The mechanics are similar to archaeology sites but with a cosmic coat of a paint. Some of the actions from the new but rather simple mechanic are pretty powerful/ fun to play with and I like the different narratives you can get. The new origin and civics are also neat but calling this an expansion is a bit of a stretch. As with all the Stellaris dlcs, buy on sale but even then, you get a lot more bang for your buck with the others besides the species packs. This one is 100% not worth full price.",1
27607,"The only DLC I disable just so I don't have to deal with the constant pings of ""your resource storage is full!"" only to discover it is, once again, astral threads, with nothing useful I want to use them on because all the actions have long cool downs. I wish there were a way to selectively disable which resources being full made a ping, because this made me just completely ignore the thing and overcapped on resources I actually cared about, like minor artifacts, which I can't see on the top bar unless I click into it.

The story bits are pretty interesting (alternate timelines of the precursors!), some of the artifacts are really powerful (size 50 gaia world? pretty pog), but I feel like its really forced into your face, you can't just choose to ignore it (because once you get to repeatables, unless you manually micromanage your physics research EVERY SINGLE TIME, you WILL research astral threads and you WILL be harassed by the pings), which ends up just making it really annoying when you're trying to focus on anything else.",0
27608,"The content is good, but it has nowhere near enough to warrant the price. It should be 5-10 dollars max.",0
27609,"I‚Äôve played the new content since it was released and I think honestly there‚Äôs a lot to dig through here. This is a DLC that gives you a lot of mileage over multiple playthroughs (most of the content is not unlockable all at once like Ancient Relics or Distant Stars or Galactic Paragons) but if you want to dive straight in, choose Riftworld origin and go nuts. Besides the DLC validation hiccups and a few persistent crashes, the number of noticeable bugs introduced has been almost non-existant. There‚Äôs a few persistent bugs but those have been around before the DLC release.

Slight spoilers ahead but I feel the DLC page doesn‚Äôt really describe the sheer scale of content here so I‚Äôm gonna try to summarize it as best I can.

Basically, buy this DLC if you like:

- 33 Branching early/mid-game storylines with non-obvious choices and high risk but high rewards. The number of localization/text lines is roughly equivalent to all of Ancient Relics archeology sites  (~1200) and trades off the quantity of archeology sites for the depth, risk and reward and branching paths potential instead.

- Storylines that have alternate timelines to 2 of the precursors.

- A civic that gives the ability to play a hyper-defensive empire that can defend planets with 6 digits (100,000+) defense numbers that will take 100 years of bombardment or a planet cracker to break and guard starbases and territory super hard.

- An alternative take to the pre-FTL exploration civics in First Contact without the tech loss and challenge.

- A civic that lets you play spiritualists that worship weird space portals (l-gates, shroud tunnels, astral rifts or wormholes)

- A civic that lets you get dark matter tech without having to beat fallen empires. It also grants unique edicts that use dark matter to achieve research, espionage bonuses, alloys and energy credit bonuses. (You can also spawn this on AI empires for an alternative method of getting the dark matter tech debris without going through FEs)

- An origin that has a unique archeology site and rift, allowing you to jump start both minor artifacts/archeotechs and astral rifts at the same time. Within 40 years, I had 5 astral rifts done and hyper relays before even getting the pre-requisite tech.

- Various actions from researching astral rifts including but not limited to: Making more astral rifts so you‚Äôre guaranteed 5 (and all the actions) if you find just 1, research hyper-relays and quantum catapults, give a permanent boost to quantum catapult effectiveness, ability to instantly generate forges without rare crystals and alloys, being able to prevent wormholes and l-gates from being accessed by closed border empires, instant jumps travel to your territory, the ability to summon extradimensional fleets for a time, removing relic cooldowns, and access to astral thread edicts.

- Astral thread edicts that let you get a 10% bonus to all resource production, +5 minor artifacts per month for a consistent source of minor artifacts if you get screwed on map generation or if you‚Äôre tall, cloaking strength and a massive bonus to shield HP and hardening.

- 8 relics, which is over half of the amount in Ancient Relics including the custodian patch that added relics to precursors!

- A new vassal type that cuts the cost of physics research tech in half. (aka research physics techs twice as fast).

- A new legendary paragon leader that can give military fleets, random physics techs or a bonus against certain crisis enemies.

- 2 Physics technologies related to astral thread extraction and exploring astral rifts.

- Several new ways of gaining leader immortality without psionics or synthetic ascension.

- New scientist leader traits and bonuses.

- Some new buildings.

- Ways of accessing various technologies before you‚Äôre supposed to.

- Replayable fun and things to do during the post-expansion midgame phase for those high skill scholar scientists.

Definitely recommend this, it‚Äôs been a blast so far and the scale of what goes on in the rifts stretches well past the already weird existing in Stellaris. There‚Äôs a universe full of blood out there. Another one full of trash. Find out for yourself what happens.",1
27610,"PDX, don't do it. You're one of the good ones. The one I use as a good example.

You know this is a 10‚Ç¨ story pack, not a 20‚Ç¨ full expansion. It just doesn't have enough content, add it, then it might be.

In general, the content is cool, but extremely overpriced, not worth unless 50% discount.

PDX, I'm done with greedy companies. Don't be CA.",0
27611,"If you want to spend 20‚Ç¨ to make your game worse go right ahead, but I'd stay clear. 

The glorified excavations are ok but not 20‚Ç¨ worth, and the astral thread interactions are annoying at best and often infuriating when the AI pulls some fresh BS out of it's ass.",0
27612,"Bought it because I buy every stellaris content. I've played around 20-30h with this DLC and have to say, that it adds very little content. Worth maybe 5-10 bucks. I'd say it's a system like archeology with a new resource. A couple of stories, some minor quality of life features but overall, I could do without it, has pretty much 0 impact on my games.",0
27613,"I don't know what possessed the devs to implement the ability to pull a fleet with an average power of 500k on medium maps out of your ass as soon as the late-early game that lasts ten years, can be instantly respawned, and is abused by the AI, but it needs to be done away with. This alone gets a negative review from me.

That aside, and even if this wasn't an issue, I can't rightly recommend this. You are basically shelling out $20 for just a few mid game stories akin to excavation sites. There is nothing special here. None of the events offer anything game changing or even interesting and the abilities aside from the aforementioned one are easily ignored.

Do yourself a favor and pass on this, even if it is on sale. This is the only dlc I have disabled. Every other dlc, even ones I disliked or are way overpriced I can at least say something positive about them. I cannot say anything positive about Astral Planes.",0
27614,"IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS GAME / CONSIDERING WHICH DLC TO BUY, BUY OTHER DLCs PLEASE.

Astral Planes are definitely not worth its price tag. Seems to me like dirty cashgrab from dedicated fans of this game.

REASONS
- astral rifts are not new mechanic, but rather non linear archeology
- astral actions and threads are really unecessary (just another resource to keep track and buttons that needs to be clicked)
- one ugly humanoid portrait
- only one origin with very little (but interesting) story (first time you play it thou)
- few very lousy achievments
- most important game tweaks were brought by free update (which fucked up outliner btw)

27615,"Genuinely the only stellaris dlc that I would consider bad regardless of price. Doesn't even add an origin trait and the ""content"" is basically less interesting dig sites that give minor research bonuses when finished. Only get this if it is in a bundle.",0
27616,"My problem with this DLC is the impactfulness of Astral Actions. Everything in this DLC is related to Astral Threads, generating them and using them. However, when it comes to the usefulness of it, its very minimal. 

I mean, we have fleets with hundreds of thousands and even millions of fleet power by the late game, and yet the End-Game DLC gives us an Unbidden fleet that despawns and has to be respawned every 10 years. And this is one of the ""strongests"" Astral Actions. By the mid-game we have the Astral Action to instantly create ONE Hyper Relay, with a very long cooldown, so you just have to do that dozens of times, for decades to fill your empire network with only Astral Actions. You can also press a button to get +10% physics research... THE most powerful perk this DLC gives us are the Relics, which were included in another DLC, and their passive/active effects are much more relevant than astral actions.

I get that its supposed to be about space exploration and travel manipulation, but come on, couldn't astral actions be more relevant?

It's like Espionage, where the concept is great but its simply not worth the trouble of getting to know and maximize the mechanics behind it. The benefits of using astral actions are very nimble.

Also, it's counter intuitive with the leader rebalance (which is part of the Free Update), since now its harder than ever to have high level leaders. Then you have the option to use this high level leader to explore an astral rift and maybe get him/her killed just for some astral threads and unlocking some useless astral actions.

Espionage was abandoned, and I'm worried that Astral Actions will also be abandoned. If Paradox improves Astral Actions or give Astral Threads more uses than I think this DLC could be worth it.",0
27617,"Astral Planes exists to give mid and late game some exploration content that it otherwise lacked. It does an okay job at that, basically adding super archaeology sites that are less linear, offer new rewards and mechanics.

However, paradox has released cheaper dlc in the past that has as much, if not more, content and impact on the overall game. Nothing in this dlc will change the way you play, it just gives you more buttons to click and things to read.

Astral Planes should be at the bottom of your list of dlc to buy and is safe to skip if you don't enjoy the narrative side of Stellaris.",1
27618,"Very little content for the price, and the update with it broke the game in many ways",0
27619,"Alright price aside, as I am someone who thinks the dlc's have enabled us to get the amazing QOL patches the last few dlcs. Lets talk about this mess.  
We are testing the bugs for them hard this time around as most of the bugs i've ran into would have been found in one run by someone who's put any amount of Stellaris hours in.  This whole pushing content to have the players test stuff has got to go.  I'm fresh off the coattails of star trek infinite being the buggiest thing i've touched in a while BUT THIS IS A CLOSE SECOND",0
27620,"As a long time and reasonable fan of Stellaris, I have enjoyed playing with this DLC. Every Rift has a unique and interesting story, and it really feels like your exploring a fantastic new 'realm.' Astral actions are on point, I just wish there was more of them, so that it was more of a choice during a playthrough about how to allocate threads. Is it worth $20? Probably not. Still a recommend for w/e it goes on sale. 

For Paradox: If y'all had cut the price in half, then it would have sold a lot more and had less negative reviews. Same profit, but with a lot less alienation. smh.",1
27621,"This ain't it. For 20 dollars, you get reskinned archaeology sites with worse rewards. They advertised it as having branching paths which translates to ""Would you like to end the rift early? Yes? Here's some 50 astral shards after you spent 500 to open the rift."" You won't even see these for years upon years (unless you sacrifice your origin to get a head start, but for what?) and if you had any hopes of playing tall, you'll get four or five at best as opposed to much more average 12+ for slightly larger empires.

Not only that, but this DLC was coupled with one of the worst updates (3.10) to date, completely botching leaders (large majority of leaders spawn with governor traits, reducing councilor slots by 1 because of a new ""required"" councilor, etc) but still making them necessary. With the amazing things that we've been seeing over the course of the past couple years, it's unfathomable how they could have dropped the ball so low.",0
27622,"I love psionics so I bought this. Unfortunately it's rather boring and I don't like the music that came with it. It might sound laughable, but the atmosphere is what makes this game so great and music is a big part of it. After getting this DLC I find the game less immersive.",0
27623,Adds more clutter that does not interact or integrate well with the pre-existing game,0
27624,"DLC Adds:

4 New Civics
1 Origin
30-ish Astral rifts
new relics
new music

My thoughts:

Civics: They are good, but only for normal bio empires. 

Origin: It is mediocre 

Astral rifts: Astral rifts are basically upgraded archaeology sites and they generate a currency called astral threads which are the equivalent of minor artifacts. If you are lucky you can get some crazy rewards including new relics. If you are not lucky you can still spend the astral threads in a special shop that actually has some really good stuff. Some of the things you can buy in the astral thread shop include boosts to physics research, sublight speed, and getting a guaranteed research for hyper-gates/quantum catapults.  Last thing of note is the true end game for astral rifts will lead you into the center of the galaxy where you will have to fight a mini crisis and honestly is what made it worth it. 

New Relics: They are strong. 

New Music: It is good.

Price: It is not good. 

Final Verdict:

If you play spiritualist empires you should get this DLC. If you play non-spiritual normal bio-empires get this DLC if you have all the other DLC. If you play machines or hive minds you might wanna wait for a sale. If you are a sweaty well you have to buy this dlc cus you need the PvP or Tall civic. :p",1

Price: 2/10

Story/roleplay: 10/10

27626,"I own all other Stellaris DLCs. I bought Astral Planes despite the mostly negative reviews.

In summary; Yes buy this if you are a Stellaris regular and need something new to add new flavour. But don't buy this as your first, second or even third DLC. There are better options.
It is not at all a badly made or thoughtless DLC. The stories are pretty interesting and make you think. The issue is more that the appeal / customer base for this particular DLC is certainly more narrow.

Honestly I get what people are talking about:
1) The new content in this DLC is almost purely story based, with a few extra traits and artefacts.
2) It's definitely, definitely overpriced for now.

Having done one play through with it, its given me more new stuff to explore in the mid-game.
Astral Rifts each have decision chains where you can explore different choices on different play throughs. 
Its purpose is to help keep the regulars interested. It's not one of the patches or DLCs designed to attract new customers.

Like with archaeology sites; there is a risk your choices will kill your scientist, or make them unavailable for a long time. 
Unlike with archaeology sites; interestingly Astral Rifts cannot be explored by Scientists on your Council.",1
27627,"'Mostly Negative'  -  Okay I admit. The pricing for what this offers is dubious. The content is hit or miss. The music slaps (Especially ""Into the Astral Rift"" hot damn)   

But if you can get it on Sale?  It's pretty decent. Not great, not amazing,  just decent.  That being said, I do like how the Astral Sites are interactive instead of simple  A to B to C to Win  like Archaeology Sites are.  The groundwork for something better, and I hope Modders one day make great use of it too!

So yes. Recommend, but on the Condition of  Sale.  Steam REALLY needs a  ""Neutral""  option like seriously Valve, get to it already.",1

Fleet spawning is Overpowered as fuck.
Everybody gets physics research boni and this causes everybody to rush the same physics tech.

I LOVE the idea of astral rifts, but the just feels lackluster. The ""many"" choices are boiling down to some pathsways that are not different from other things already in the game . I love the idea of finding precursors in the past of an alternate dimension but it feels like it cshould be more.",0
27632,"I've had Stellaris since it's release and it is, one of my favourite games. However, now I find it is seriously marred, by most of its DLC's. I have purchased every dlc for this game and now I'm finding that it is becoming impossible to enjoy playing. I play on ""slower"" speed, and even then I find that I get 5 or 6 Popups, almost continually. 

This  disrupts any attempt at role-playing which is the reason why I play and from an enjoyable experience has become a chore, huge headache and totally ridiculous!! From a great game with interesting story lines that emerge each time you play, it has become an endless  click/ popup fest which break any attempt at game emersion!

This dlc has only made things much worse!!  If any more content is to be added to this game, it has to be done some other way, than by adding more text and pop ups in a game that is already inundated with this means of storytelling. It is not the only way, it is just lazy and the game is no better for it.

Time to start fixing what is already there.",0
27633,"The astral plane (or ""the Shroud"") was always one of the most interesting aspects of Stellaris lore. At release our interactions with the Shroud were limited. As a spiritualist empire you got to venture into this mysterious realm through text-box interactions at regular intervals. It wasn't great, but it offered a unique playstyle and established the materialist-spiritualist dichotomy. Playing as a psychic species gave you a unique jump drive, ground forces and pop traits which weren't all that different from anything else in the game but at least felt thematic. The crowning feature was a way to ruin your own galaxy which I won't spoil here. The whole thing dripped with potential but felt stapled onto the game at the last minute but I always chalked this up to: ""It's a new game. And this is Paradox. Just give them a few years to make a DLC for it"".

Things that I hoped for in this potential DLC:
- Jedi/Sith inspired leaders who can use mind tricks on other NPC characters
- A full Shroud-based shipset, cityscape, and maybe an origin or two
- In-game representation of Shroud-space, or at the very least a map layer
- Shroud storms which can be manifested in the real galaxy to be wielded as weapons of mass destruction
- Finishing the base game Shroud features as part of the free update

This expansion has none of that. By now tumble weeds must float through the original Shroud from total neglect because this DLC has not detected it's existence. Instead it adds Astral Rifts, which are just archaeology sites with extra steps. And did it really need to add yet another tab to the already bloated interface? Navigating the astral plane is exactly the same gameplay as archaeology/anomaly hunting. And after 3 playthrough since getting this DLC: what the hell is even an Astral Thread? Can I sew them together to make an astral handkerchief to wipe my tears?

This is easily the least interesting DLC. Buy this only if you run out of ideas during a steam sale.",0
27634,"They over promised, under delivered and over charged for this DLC. I noticed a lack of good content from Paradox Interactive. After this poor launch, and Star Trek infinite.

Seems like they only care about revenue,  and short sighted gains. Gross!",0
27635,If this wouldn't have been advertised and sold at the price of an expansion I don't think this would have got all the negativity one encounters here. It is actually a quite nice story pack and should have been advertised as this. But before complaining get it at a discount later.

But at least with Astral Planes, I can pick out one little thing, the portrait they added which just looks‚Ä¶ awful. So lazy, complete and utter contrast with every other portrait in the game. An afterthought, rushed perhaps, something to just put a checkmark on a list and say some achievement was accomplished. Soo‚Ä¶ perhaps that‚Äôs a hint.",0

[h1] Review [/h1]
Self Defense Dojo is a simulation/rpg game where you control the stereotypical fœÖckboy who is a useless aragan but is extremely perverted and good at pleasing women in bed similar to the protagonists of ""NTR lengend"" ""Ntraholic"" ""Peeping Dorm Manager"", etc. and that this time is dedicated to train attractive women in the art of self defense, but taking advantage to grope and corrupt them.
The game is basically governed by a system of schedules during the day, in which depending on the time you can perform different activities, such as training the girls in the dojo, buy items in the store, work as a laborer to get money, fishing to get money and special items, and other small activities.
The main objective of the game is to train the girls in a certain technique, grope them during the training to increase their lust and finally have sex with them, to achieve this it is necessary to increase the skill level of the MC, increasing his strength and technique by training in the dojo and buying technique books in the supermarket which are necessary to unlock all types of training and view all groping scenes.
Everything in the game requires money so it is also important to farm this aspect, either working as a laborer, looking for treasures or selling fish, personally I find the work of fishing easier and that rewards you better and above all gives you access to multiple special items that unlock events with als girls, such as surveillance cameras, the key of their homes,training objects etc..
The game tends to be quite repetitive because you constantly have to farm money, stats and the lust of the girls, although luckily the game offers a variety of mini-games to make this task less monotonous, such as the training game which is basically skill checks, the scavenging game which consists of guiding a drill to find treasures, the training one with button smash,etc.The game also has other rpg stats for the main character, such as stamina, which starts at 100 and every strenuous activity reduces it, so it is necessary to feed the MC to replenish it, but there are also special objects which increase it permanently, or that increase the speed with which you increase the lust of the girls in the mini-games, making the gameplay easier and more automatic as you advance in the game.
Graphically the game is good, has a unique art style in the sprites of characters quite cartoonish, and a generic character design for the secondary characters but quite original for the girls you have to corrupt, which have enough details, in question of the sexual scenes the art of these has to go for something similar to a pixel art but high resolution where you can barely squeeze the pixels in the lines.
In terms of sound, the game has little variety of background music, always sounding the same, with the exception of the mini-games, and also the game includes some voice acting but only in short phrases in scenes.
üîû[b]sexual content[/b]
The game has a huge amount of sex scenes, although half of them are variations of another similar scene but having a small change like changing from vaginal to anal. These scenes are mostly sex animations using the in game character modeling and sometimes having a larger and higher quality 2D animation approach these sex scenes have motion animations and a speed control with which you can alternate the rhythm and motion animation, besides of these sex scenes, there are other type available which are the groping mini-games that occur in defense training or on the movie dates these are progressive since you first have to undress the girl with mini skill check games to next grope her in different parts of her body with sustained clicks increasing her lust but avoiding to make her angry, similar to what we have seen in NTR legend,  both types of scenes are uncensored, have sound effects and some voice acting.
The main genre that can be seen in the sex scenes of the game are directly related to the NTR, as all the girls have a partner or similar, yet these scenes are mixed with other fetishes to give more variety, such as: sex in public, sex next to the husband, sex on the sly, bondage, sex in the shower, sex toys, exibisionismo, etc..Within the fetishes there is also the internal view available to see how the MC's c√òck penetrates the girl.
Since the game features 3 different girls with different size of attributes, age and hair color, you can find one that suits your personal taste with ease. The game also has a scene gallery so you can view any previously unlocked scenes at any time.

üí≠[b]Conclusion[/b]
a fairly complete game in general terms, has a variety of activities to perform, multiple mini-games to add variety, lots of objectives for which farmear money, attributes, lust etc. to increase the duration of the game, but above all a lot of sexual content of the NTR type, with 3 hot girls, thanks to that have animations of movement and sound effects end up being quite lewd and enjoyable for manual labor.
Although the game is above average in terms of quality and content, it does have some flaws or shortcomings, firstly the game is quite repetitive that although it is due to the very nature of the gameplay of the game, it is also because the game requires a lot of farmeo and this is not exactly fast, another notorious defect dle game is the translation of the game into English as it presents untranslated text, strange words and text that does not fit with the dialogue boxes, although this does not detract from its enjoyment.
If you like the graphics of the game and you have already played other titles that take as a reference to NTR legend as the ones I named at the beginning, it will certainly be a game that you will enjoy more than anything else, and due to its content, you can play it for hours, and it is certainly a great addition to your nightly library.

üåü[h1]Overview:[/h1]
[code] In ""Self Defense Dojo,"" players enter the life of Kotaro Morimura, a man haunted by his past ties to the yakuza. Seeking to escape, he becomes a self-defense instructor in a remote village dojo, where he embarks on morally dubious adventures. This game, intended for adults only, delves into complex themes of manipulation and betrayal under the guise of teaching judo, showcasing the protagonist's descent into exploiting his authority to corrupt his students‚Äîmostly women in committed relationships. [/code]

üéÆ[h1]Synopsis and Gameplay:[/h1]
[code]In ""Self Defense Dojo,"" players take on the role of Kotaro Morimura, who oscillates between his duties as a dojo instructor and engaging in more clandestine activities aimed at manipulating and seducing his students, as well as the local convenience store clerk. The game features a point & click interface that allows for exploration of various locations, some of which become accessible as the storyline advances. Gameplay is governed by a day/night cycle that impacts Kotaro‚Äôs ability to perform various tasks.

Managing your stamina is crucial, as it affects Kotaro's ability to carry out daily activities such as judo training, construction work, treasure hunting, and fishing. Strategic planning is key, as players must enhance Kotaro‚Äôs martial arts skills while also engaging in mini-games that simulate both physical training and secretive tasks. These activities are essential for advancing his dual objectives, which include the gradual corruption of the three women targeted by our protagonist.[/code]

üìñ[h1]Story and Depth:[/h1]
[code] In ""Self Defense Dojo,"" players embody Kotaro Morimura, a disciple under a dojo master with a hidden agenda as a manipulative womanizer. Kotaro's life is a balance of honing his self-defense techniques and exploiting his charm to corrupt his female students. The game intricately layers his personal quests with his duties, pushing players to influence relationships with various characters: Mayuko Hasegawa, a married woman; Aya Matsushita, an engaged athletic woman; and Yui Matsubara, a day worker at the local convenience store.

The narrative thickens with the introduction of Rika Ijuin, the intimidating granddaughter of a rival dojo master, whose formidable presence and aggressive behavior add complexity to Kotaro's challenges. She is not only physically imposing but also aggressively confrontational, which tests Kotaro's limits in unexpected ways.

Players are tasked with managing Kotaro's daily activities which include training sessions at the dojo, subtly manipulating his students, and working at construction sites to secure the funds needed for enhancing his abilities and acquiring necessary gear. Effective management of these tasks is crucial as Kotaro navigates his morally ambiguous path, making strategic choices that will define his journey's outcome. [/code]

üèÜ[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
[code] ""Self Defense Dojo"" distinguishes itself as a captivating simulation/RPG game, featuring point & click gameplay and sophisticated pixel art animations that resonate with fans of popular NTR games like ""NTR Legend"" and the eagerly anticipated ""Ntraholic."" In this game, players step into the shoes of Kotaro Morimura, a master manipulator and skilled womanizer, offering a fresh perspective within the NTR genre. Unlike typical NTR games where the focus is on being cuckolded, here you play the orchestrator, adeptly seducing and corrupting women while cleverly maintaining amicable ties with their partners.

This role demands more than mere deception; it requires strategic interaction management to ensure Kotaro's manipulative endeavors are successful. Players are tasked with improving Kotaro‚Äôs stats through diverse activities, navigating complex relationships that are as challenging as they are rewarding. The game's mature and provocative themes are seamlessly integrated with gameplay mechanics, making it an essential addition for any NTR genre enthusiast who relishes directing the narrative and influencing the outcomes. 

Although ""Self Defense Dojo"" encounters some minor technical and translation shortcomings, it offers an engaging and deeply rewarding experience.  It adeptly melds strategic gameplay with complex storytelling, making it highly appealing to players who appreciate games that challenge both their tactical skills and moral boundaries.""[/code]

27640,"Train self-defense to helpless women by grinding and groping them. 

The game places you in the shoes of a young man who comes to work for the elderly judo master. If you accept the position of teacher, you are welcome to stay at the dojo. Despite receiving a daily allowance, you will still be responsible for paying the rent and the old man's training courses. The best part is that you'll be teaching gorgeous girls how to defend themselves. 

Art is incredibly great for an adult game. You get to visit several locations that are packed with small details. Camera control is not great, but it‚Äôs not required that often because of small locations that fit the screen. 

Freedom in the game is limited to hotspots and marked exits. Although some rare hotspots can be checked for a brief comment from the character, they don't offer much. You can check them out on the first day and possibly find some additional cash, but after that, you can forget about them because they don't replenish or add new comments.

Aside from the dojo, you can explore six additional locations in town. Two buildings will only unlock once you get to know the females a little better. The other locations include a construction site where you can work for a few hours for extra money (if you have enough energy), you can go fishing in the mountains, see a movie in the theater, or buy important items at the shop. Items are pricey, but they can reduce grind time, teach you new moves, and refill energy. 

Buying food seems like a waste of money. Although you can only execute a few actions per day, you aren't forced to compete with time. You are able to do whatever you want, and sleeping helps to recover your energy. Characters will always remain in their current locations. Aside from the master and girls, there are a few additional characters with whom you can converse and make happy with presents. 

When the girl first enrolls at school, you will see an information card about her. It offers a brief biography as well as some additional information, such as breast size and zodiac sign. But what matters most is the girl's desire to learn lessons and her level of lust. Lessons are simple minigames. You must either mash buttons or stop a moving target in the correct position. 

Because judo may result in inappropriate touching, your character takes advantage of whatever opportunity he can get. There is a lot of grinding and groping. By holding down the mouse button on an action, you can increase the girl's enjoyment and resistance. Resistance builds up quickly, and if you go too far, the lesson ends. The catch is to wait a few seconds for it to drop, then repeat till you've had your fill of pleasure. Once this is done, the girl's lust will increase. You will always gain some, but it will fill up much faster if you do not rush things. 

The gameplay is pretty repetitive. You'll need to repeat a lot of the same actions to build her lust level. This is the only way to reach the nasty bits. Lust levels unlock sex scenes. The harder you grind, the more opportunities you'll have. These do not take long because you can adjust the speed slider to move through them more quickly. These, too, raise the girl's lust level. Unfortunately, most of the scenes are pixelated.

In the end, the game can be considered casual. You can easily grind for money at the construction site and quickly buy the best stuff from the store. Time spent in the game will depend on how much of the sexy things you‚Äôre willing to see.",1

27648,"6/10 its ok
Has translation errors, kanji hasnt been translated, overlapping text & minigames are a bit janky.
The animations also seem a bit lazily done, with the game just stretching still images to make it look animated.

You wrestle, do some QTE's, mess with the lust bar & you fuck the girl. Ya know, the usual stuff.
To use the more extreme/perverted holds you're gonna need to grind your strenght & skill stats. And when i mean grind i really mean grind.
You can grind both of these 1-3k per try & you're gonna have to do a bunch of these to get levels.

Since you need money to get the skills you can either go work at constructionsite for about 2,400 per job or buy a fishing rod & do this rly boring fishing minigame the entire day for chump change.
The only good way to get cash is to dig for treasures at the constructionsite, but you gotta pay for the equipment upkeep & you'll only get paid next day. You're gonna play this one a lot since the minigame tends to drag on the more upgrades you have, but it does pay handsomely.
The more you dig the better money you make, but to get the best stuff you have to unlock gear by fishing A LOT.

The stuff the fisherman sells you is really good, but cost 300-999 fish coins which you can get in pretty small ammounts until you get the best fishingrod from digging.
When it comes to fishing id just ignore the small / medium fish as they rly dont get you that many fish coins, just catch the big fish & re-enter fishing spot to respawn the big ones.

The value of items in the shop is also all over the place. Since you can get those fat stacks of cash from digging, the items should also cost you an arm & a leg. You also cant buy items in bulk so if you want 5 health items you'll get spammed for each item bought & these text boxes will stat there quite a while. Same goes when you use more than 1 item at a time.",1
27649,"Play as the cool looking hentai protagonist, and use your deadly judo skills to NTR weaker males. You also get to go fishing.",1
27650,"the game is decent but TBH it's way too much of a work/grind for what it is/worth. To start off, building the lust with them is slow and doesn't even become reasonable until you buy all items that increase lust growth and even that is a hassle with the grindy as-hell money system, like ffs it's a hentai game you shouldn't have to work for days of game time just to be able to buy a few things and even then you are SOOO far from completing it. The graphics are okay at best, a lot of pixels and unclear images to truly say it's good. all in all i would say i give it a solid 6.5/10. if they manage to dial down the grind of the game and tweak pricing of items along with improving graphics i would say it would be probably an 8/10 if not even a bit higher",1
27651,"The UI and translations aren't perfect... there are a number of confusing pitfalls... but its an excellent value. All characters are at least very hot... author has perfect taste.

Biggest complaint is the random nature of the scene picker... I've tried countless times to get a bathroom scene to no avail. Poor translations also made me miss the courtyard scenes. I have no idea how to get the construction site scenes. Mermaid girl was my favorite early on, but I couldn't figure out her mechanics... progress is not clear.",1
27652,"The game desperately needs an autosave feature, and/or a ""confirmation of destructive action"" dialog when you try to exit without saving. I've lost my save data twice by accidentally clicking the wrong button.

I also experienced the issue where the game loads in Japanese on first launch. Not a big issue but wanted to let the developer know it's still happening, because they responded to another review saying that it wasn't.",0
27653,"Well, last time I played this was a bit more than a month ago but because the new game is out I came back to finish this and it was a pain, I will give a rant later, I really like this game so I will talk about the good and tips before the bad (For me at least).

The gameplay is really fun, I enjoy the minigames and trying to figure how to get the achievements and such, although at some point it does become repetitive, especially since I had to do a full second playthrough to get all achievements (except one which is the Rika underwear, I have no fucking idea where they are, I tried doing a third playthrough to try clicking on her bag, but nothing happened).

Story, you are a guy who fondles women and somehow get's away with it and also turn them into sex addicts pretty much, the mc is a fucking scum bag, but overall it is fine, there isn't too much story, either that or I forgot since it has been a month (Not the best way to do a review of a game).

Hentai, there is a lot of animations, though they do get repetitive and also annoying if you want to get achievements but can't get the fucking one you need for so long that you were losing hope (Fucking master's room, I hate it), there are two types of hentai here, the fondling which is a minigame where you need to up their lust while keeping the anger low, it was annoying at the start since it was slow, until you get to end game where they just keep cumming every second so you take a lot of time to finish the minigame, thankfully there is an item that let's you skip it and get the rewards, now the second one, it is animations, each room has 2 animation choices who then also have 2 animations to choose from (Some rooms have two different position so it ends being 4 total choice 2 and 2 depending on the position and each of them have 2 animation movements, so there are a lot, though some are the same or close to each other), there is also a camcorder item that let's you get videos and sell them, you need it for achievements, but the best part about the animation is the 3x speed, no need to sit around watching the same thing over and over again (Well you do, it still takes a lot of time of watching them again and again).

Overall, I would recommend it if you want a chill game, if you want to achievement hunt, it is kind of rng, but if you know what you want from the start you should be fine, now I will give a few tips (I remember having a lot more a month ago but I forgot them)

One, the movie and construction cgs, they were a bit of a pain to get until I figured it out and it is the easiest thing, for the movie you first need to get the boyfriend/husband's friendship up, try getting money and then just buying them over, after that you can join them in the movies, to get the movies it is time based or something, but I found a way to 100% get the movie (At least I don't remember it failing for me) what you need to do is straight out the bed, go to the dojo and do one training with the one you want to watch a movie with, after you do the training, leave and go to the cinema, when you are there pass time until they appear and join them. As for the construction cg, I don't know what you need to do first, just try getting to know Yui (I think is the green haired name) and get maybe one movie cg, after that go to the construction site before 2am, when you reach there pass time and an event will happen, repeat the next days until you need to called their name (I think it was Yui) after that she runs away, now this is where I was stuck a month ago, but while doing these steps again because I didn't remember which save I used before, I found out what i missed which I can't believe I did, if you go there between 12am and 2am, you can hear noises and if you look to the left you see dark figures, click on them a few times, I don't remember what happens next, if nothing pass time and go home, return the next day, after a few times you will get the first cg, return the day after for the second and last one.

Another important thing, the story ends on the 20th of June, so if you want all the farewell, save on the 19th, after that you can load and do all the others.

Well, I think theses are the good and tips, now I need to rant about something and the reason I dropped this game a month ago, this game is fun, I like it, but the fucking cgs ruined it, now that I came to finish it I had to sit through most of them (other than Yui's since they were done and the construction is short) omg I hate them, couldn't they animate it even a little bit? Honestly though, it isn't even that, it is the fucking narrator, all the cgs felt kind of the same with ""Mc fuck me harder"" and mc ""I'm the best"" but iff that was it I would be fine, the narrator wouldn't shut up, it was so much over nothing, ""the moment your penis entered her vigina you feel electrifying while she is already squirting from your huge penis while her husband is next to her, but you didn't care nor did she and blablablablablabla"" something that could be done in less than a minute took so long, and it wasn't even interesting, it was just the girls praising mc and mc acting like some sex lord. The whole thing is just the same cg for a while with the narrator not shutting up and mc acting like a sex lord with the woman moaning once in a while, it was painful to sit through, it was so bad I dropped the game before and now I just wanted it to end. So yeah, that's like my biggest problem, the cg scenes were awful, they were boring, annoying, way too long for no reason, if it was just the cgs. mc and female, it would be fine, heck, narrator once in a while would be welcomed, but it is just him going on and on like I'm doing right now, hmm, maybe we are not so different after all.

Anyway, I will end my rant here, if you read all this, why? But also thanks I guess, have a fantastic day.",1
27654,"[h2] The ""Art"" of Judo [/h2]

Self Defense Dojo is a life sim game where you manage your time earning money, ""teaching"" Judo, and interacting with a handful of different women. The game offers a variety of mini-games to master and CG's to collect, all stemming from a simple yet satisfying game loop. With a soft and clean art style, you'll want to see it all on your journey as a Judo ""instructor.""

[b] Now I'd like to mention some things I appreciate: [/b]
The first thing you'll see is the game's art, which is one of the most important things for a game like this. The colors are nice and coherent, the cel shading and highlights are all very clean, and the shapes and colors make the characters very pleasing to look at. Overall, I find the art to have a lot of charm. Along with the art is the animation. Each interactable scene comes with its own smooth animation to complement the art of each character. The game also features various mini games, from Judo ""matches,"" to digging for treasure, and even fishing. (I love fishing) The mini games are simple and straight forward (you wouldn't want overly difficult mini games in a game like this) and lend to a satisfying game loop. Its fun to watch your money and stats go up as you hit milestones and benchmarks to unlock new interactions with the girls. And the rewards for your efforts are [i] very nice. [/i] The game also features subtle comedic moments and not so subtle references that I quite enjoyed. (There is a Jojo reference right off the bat that I found absolutely hilarious.)

[b] Additional Notes: [/b]
Here is where I'd like to mention some issues and similar things I ran into while playing this game. The first thing to mention is that there are minor errors in the English translation of this game. Thankfully they are fairly unintrusive and never cause the meaning of a sentence to be lost. As a result, it is hardly an issue in practice. Now, the major problem with the English translation, is the formatting issues. As an example, a Japanese word that would have taken up 1 or 2 characters in Kanji, can now take up to 8 for a word like ""Strength."" This means that in some of the menus and UI, text will often bleed into the nearby words and numbers, overlapping each other. This doesn't make the words unreadable, but can mess with visual clarity in some menus. Thankfully this overlapping issue doesn't happen with character dialogue, instead, words will sometimes pop out of the bottom of the dialogue box in longer sentences. While I am highlighting this issue, it is worth mentioning that it never affected my experience negatively, it is simply something to be aware of, and will hopefully be fixed at some point. Other than that, I encountered no real bugs and had an overall smooth gameplay experience.

All and all, apart from some errors in the English translation, Self Defense Dojo has a chill gameplay loop, charming art and animation, with a handful of interesting women to interact with. If what I've described sounds appealing to you, then please feel free to pick up Self Defense Dojo, and check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44931296-VA-Views/ ]Curator Page[/url] for more reviews.",1
27655,"TLDR: Yui best girl because she kinda reminds me of Ubel from Frieren.

It is recommended to get the ‚ÄòYakuza Rogue 1&2 Bundle‚Äô as both games are related to each other. Self Defense Dojo should be played before Yakuza Rogue as it is considered as the prequel to it. Yes, you see it right, there is actually plot in this game.

In general, this is a time management game with mostly clicking on the stuff to do. You can play as MC to do various tasks in the game such as training the girls or yourself in the dojo, fishing, going to cinema, working part time to earn extra money, buying/selling stuffs through black market. 

There are only five girls which you can have seggs with (Milf, University student, Convenience store worker, Kappa girl and the Ugly giant boss). The seggs scenes can be triggered at various places such as inside the dojo, cinema, tent or even construction site. It can be done easily if you know what the requirement to trigger the seggs scene is and it does not feel very repetitive.

The good part about the gameplay besides seggs is of course the NTR part. You can actually NTR the girls and their husband/boyfriend. You can gain trust with the male partner and watch them fall into despair after you NTR-ing their girl. You can also do stuff that you can‚Äôt legally do in the real world such as drugging the male partner or record sex videos and sell it at black market.

However, the game is not perfect. One thing that I dislike about the game is the voice acting or should rather say the moaning sound during seggs scene. Some of the moaning sounds so ridiculous and horrible that it made me laugh during the climax scene. There is also no fully voiced scenes which can be a minus point for some people.

Also, if you are perfectionist and trying to complete all the achievements, some of the achievements require a lot of farming such as fishing 200 times. Personally I dislike this type of achievement farming so this is a minus point from me.

Overall, I would say the game is worth getting even at full price. If you do not mind to wait, you can get the bundle version whenever there is discount for better experience as the plot of both games are related to each other.

Artwork is fully uncensored and looks nice. The character introductions and their profiles + music was really perfect. There are a LOT of different scenarios and poses you can unlock/randomly encounter with the different girls. I had quite a few scenes left in the gallery that I didn't see in my first playthrough, so you'll likely need to do a carry-over save and grind in order to get them all. The extra content is worth looking into, especially the scenes at the cinema.

I'm a huge fan of the fact that the main character has a rather charming appearance to him despite his problematic history. Having a male character actually look like somebody with some sort of backstory is nice. He even has a sleazy personality to match his appearance and sociopathic behavior revolving around sexually harassing women (great)!

There was a lot of grinding to do, especially in the earlier parts of the game that got a bit monotonous. At some point you do stop grinding for money. Once you get the drills/infrared camera and start selling video tapes it really cuts down how much you have to work for it. At the time of writing this, there are some things that looked like they were left unfinished (a fourth spot to leave a wireless camera that doesn't exist, mildly broken translations) but these are not game-breaking and didn't impede my enjoyment.

The craziest part is this game has a sequel! The sequel (Yakuza Rogue: Yokohama Massage Parlor) is much more polished than Self Defense Dojo from what I've seen so far, so if you're like me and like Kota and whatever weird bullshit he's up to, you should play it. It seems like a huge improvement from the first 30 minutes of that game alone.

TL;dr good art, lots of scenes to unlock. A lot of grinding too, but worth it. If you enjoyed this game, there is also a sequel that seems very promising.",1
27657,"[b]TLDR[/b]: Astounding H game with unparalleled arts, great gameplay and satisfying H scenes. I am especially fond of the art in this game; the ladies are drawn too perfectly and I am still dreaming of them when writing this review. There are a few parts that require grinding, especially if you are aiming for 100% achievement, but nonetheless, you will never feel bored when you can pound your favorite lady. Ayano is the CUTEST!

Greetings kouhai-kun, welcome to the Self Defense Dojo. My name is AV and I will introduce you to the story and mechanics of the game. First, the story... it is straightforward but its simplicity is what makes this Dojo unique and undemanding. Next... I am sorry to say the in-game tutorial is on the wrong edge of the world, so you have to explore, mess around, trial & error a bit, but one thing for sure kouhai-kun; this Dojo just requires your right hand to do the job. [i](whatever you plan to do with the left hand is entirely up to your imagination)[/i]

We have two newcomers that will be participating soon, you will do well to instruct them and if possible, make them fall heads over heels as you unlock their lustful nature. There are plenty of H activities that you can indulge in, with many different scenes as you progresses. Although there is no voice acting, the moaning, the SFX combining with the peak art is suffice to make your bottom part rival against the Wonders of the World.

Aside than working as an instructor at the Dojo; there are plenty of entertainments around town, feel free to hit up on interesting mini-games that will delight you during your stay. As our town is pretty isolated, ample of items sold is bloody expensive, so you need to grind up a lot of income... not to mention some achievements do take up a lot of time.

That's all I have kouhai-kun, now I shall make haste and escape before my butt is chopped down by YKZ. It seems they have tracked me here and I need to escape to [i]Yokohama[/i]. May you enjoy your stay at the Self Defense Dojo. And~~ Ayano is the CUTEST!!

Oh, I nearly forgot, this Dojo has plethora of NTRs (you are the one NTR-ing), if this is not your click, you may choose to instruct at a different Dojo. Overall, recommended for sure!! Sayonara~

27658,"Welcome to the fishing game you can play one-handed, which also has some fun scenes on occasion.   Do I recommend it?  Eh... if you like fishing yes.   It's not horrible, but there are better NTR games out there if that's your thing.

The story (really, do you care?)   You end up in a dojo for forgettable reasons, and to stay, you need to make yourself useful and train women in Judo.   Specifically, two women.  And scene.

The grind, I mean game play:   The women are gated behind lust.   The more you judo feel them up, the more you eventually get to do.  To make the judo easier you must build up skill (pretty easy) and strength (this is a horrible grind particularly because where my mouse stopped wasn't always where and when I clicked.   Getting better at these stats allows you to do more ""judo"" moves and get more scenes.  

Apart from lust, strength, and skill, there is also money and fish.   Money can be acquired by finding hidden money, working at the construction site via labor or eventually digging, and then fishing after you buy a fishing pole and upgrade it to level 3.

For the fastest progression, ignore the women and do construction/dig/fish.    Buy upgrades to digging and fishing.  Buy food to restore stamina so you can dig and fish more.  The good news is that digging and fishing are one-handed.   

Eventually, you have resources and can start working on the women.   There are two in the dojo, one at the store, and a muscle-bound girl who has the hots for you and you can try to beat or lose to.   Working strength and Stamina will help you succeed.  OH, and fish girl who has the hots for someone you can drug and then take her instead.  

The women have a number of places you can have fun with.   You have options at the dojo after you train.  You can eventually take them in their apartment at two time ranges during the day, you can also do one girl in the store and all of them at the movie theater.  The store girl is also supposed to be mobbed at the construction site but I haven't done that yet and I need to look up the trigger.

The scenes are single positions and you click a right or left mouse button and hold down until it's done.   In the dojo, you can do it three times, but elsewhere, it is a single shot.   So, no real change of positions, no covering walls with white paint or whatever.

Overall, I spent a lot more time fishing than anything else (which was probably the best fishing game I've played in these sorts of games because it was relaxing and one-handed).   I would consider this more a fishing game and an achievement game than a ""fun"" game.  

Would I recommend the game?   As I mentioned above there are a number of games that I like better, but it's not the worst.   For those people with a specific itch I'll say ""sure"" although I'd recommend  NTRaholic first.  For others, it's not the worst game, and the grind is grindy, but you don't have to button mash, which I appreciate.  So, it's all right, and I'd recommend it on sale.",1
27659,"Meh, the game is only OK. Translation is poor and lots of sentences don't make sense. Gameplay is repetitive. The scenes recently got uncensored however there are a couple situations that are still a little censored and some of the original drawings I guess weren't full drawn so there are some places where you just see white.  The scenes i saw were pretty decent just not really what I was looking for. Some of the content is still in Japanese so not really sure how the character feels about whats going on. It was a miss for me.",0
27660,"A simple yet great game. some parts haven't been properly translated, but it doesn't affect much.  Two main women to train and get closer to. One muscular monster to fight off (hopefully), and two side pieces to have some fun. Fishing, mining, and av making.

27661,"Good stuff, but slightly slow on achieving money and items. Would be nice if some method of getting money automatically, and some artwork that can be pursued through game and viewed would be beneficial.",1
27662,"Pretty good, it's a mite tedious to get all the achievements but entertaining if you're a bit of an autist. Obviously pick this up if you're a fan of ntr, or if you can bear with the art that's a bit rough around the edges.
The translation is spotty in some places but it isn't bad enough to take away from the experience, and there's a few bugs if you're a little rough and impatient with clicking.

I'm probably going to get nightmares tonight after seeing Rika.",1
27663,"fishing  and drilling for treasure are too important. too Critical to getting the full play through when they are fully unrelated to the goal of the of the piece. which is to cuck the most inattentive partners to ever grace this mortal coil. also the suck, no mercy, but like the game rhythm is bad so *raspberry*",0

27665,"Relaxed and chill game,
Dont expect too much out of game.

The game really need more polished and translation,
You will be very confuse in the beginning of game,

Just a newbie tips (spoiler free...) :
1. The game HAVE an END at 20/6 and it will come without warning.it just sudden end.
2. Training the lady at the dojo,ONLY get lust NOT money, you need to do other work and ""sell"" video ( it also NECESSARY to get ending) to gain money
3. There is a secret woman, (or maybe not so secret, its on the game cover) that didnt get by the dojo route
4. Fishing only when you already buy the hightest price rod, the game mechanic is all same with what fish you get, so its better to use better rod to gain better fish
5. [Spoiler] Spycam [/Spoiler] ..... Welp, full of disappoinment.",1
27666,"Very fun game, doesn't take much to get started, there is an English option (which I believe when you are on the main page select the 3rd menu option and from there you should see English). There were few minor glitches, but that won't stop you from playing the game. 

Note there is an In-game achievement and Steam achievement, use that to help you complete Steam Achievement. You may either need to save your game or do at least 2 runs to get 100% completion. The game does have a day timer so you may not complete everything in one run.

Overall game is great and highly recommend it 4.5/5",1
27667,"- Good! However, it could have been better. Firstly, the game lacks life-size computer graphics and detailed character animations, not chibi-style characters. Secondly, the interactivity on the map is not sufficient. Thirdly, there are not many characters in the game, and there is no Aoi character in the gallery.",1
27668,"A harmless looking game, which is actually pretty naughty. Graphics are good, and the game overall is pretty funny. Nice gameplay loop, which gets a bit repetitive at some point, but it's worth the money. The translation is not the best, but all right. Also it's a bit buggy. Even with the flaws it's a recommended lewd management to pass time. Looking forward to their new game. :)",1
27669,"Great game. Good game play and great in game animated scenes. A few cons though:

- Game can be buggy. Things only fully worked in my 2nd play through
- Game can be grindy. Particularly if you're looking to get the fishing and jackhammer related achievements
- The ""CG"" are basically still moving images but with sound effects and words, like a visual novel
- Some gallery elements are missing, like the fish girl scenes and the cashier girl at the store scenes

After you reach 6.20 (time limit) and go to sleep, game allows you to carry over fish and money currencies, and also allows you to choose from various items. Obviously pick the most important items.",1
27670,"NTR game. Art is decently good, plenty of positions for content, plenty of things to find and a lot of items. Has couple of minigames, which get rather grindy after a while. Plays in a bit clunky way, where you can occasionally queue event to happen twice back to back or create a massive backlog of notifications if you use items etc. too fast.
A recommend if its your kink. Hard pass for anyone who doesnt like it.",1

[h1]This isn‚Äôt Judo, This is Anal SEX![/h1]
Netori simulators, as I call them, have become quite popular after NTR Legend came out, blew everyone's minds, and inspired other devs to make similar games. [b]Self Defense Dojo - Secret NTR Lessons[/b] is one such game and also the current winner of the DLSite English Awards 2023. Are you curious to know how good the game is? Keep reading to find out!

[h3]Pros[/h3]
- Solid gameplay with a good variety of minigames
- Charming art style
- Serviceable plot that adds to the experience
- Plenty of animated sex scenes

[h3]Cons[/h3]
- It‚Äôs a bit grindy

[h1]Story[/h1]
The game puts you in the shoes of a fuckboy named Kota Morimura, who had to take refuge in a dojo in the countryside after banging the wrong woman and is allowed to stay under the condition that he teaches Judo to its female students. The problem? He hasn't practiced dojo for ages and barely remembers the basics, but he's more than ready to relearn everything and take advantage of the situation while he's at it. 

There isn't much focus on the story past the introduction, but it gives enough info to make characters more than simple NPCs you interact with. Moreover, it features many references and funny situations that lighten the mood, such as when the protagonist meets the overly muscular female challenger who is head over heels for him.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3221712749
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
One of the most important parts of a game like this one is its gameplay, and it doesn't disappoint at all. It consists of managing your schedule and your energy to win over all the girls of the town, and instead of having a single game mechanic, it features a variety of fun mini-games you find everywhere in the game. For example, the Judo training consists of a mini-game in which you left-click and right-click in succession fast enough to topple your opponent, followed by another one where you have to click at the right time to lock your opponent. If you succeed, you then play the ubiquitous mini-game where you touch your trainee in inappropriate places to arouse her without angering her. 

How well you do in the training depends on the MC's strength and skill level, and how do you raise them? You guessed right; you do so by playing more mini-games, such as stopping a meter at the right time to train your strength and using left or right click when prompted to train your skill, similar to what you do in the Sexing Chickens mini-game in NTR Legend and the Trash Recycling mini-game in Peeping Dorm Manager. 

There are even more of them unrelated to training. For example, there's the fishing mini-game everyone loves in which each fish you catch gives you points you can later trade for money and items that'll make your life easier, a drilling mini-game that'll make you stinkingly rich and net you some useful items, and a movie-watching mini-game in which you try to get down and dirty with one of the girls without making too much noise and getting noticed by their partner.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3221712832
Its biggest downside is that it takes a lot of grinding to max out the girls' lust and their partner's favorability to the point that it's better to focus on getting money and items that increase stat gains first so the game doesn't get repetitive after a while.

[h1]Visuals and Sexual Content[/h1]
The game features a unique and charming art style that differentiates it from the rest of the H-games, plus its characters and backgrounds are pleasing to the eye. As for its sexual content, it features a good amount of nicely animated sex scenes that you can tweak to your liking, whether you want the walls or the MC to be semi-transparent, the speed of his movements, or the X-ray bits to be visible. Moreover, later scenes also feature highly polished still shots that add some variety to the scenes. 

There's a lot of corrupting and cheating in the game, as you'd imagine given the game's genre, with some extra flavors that make things spicier, such as public sex, banging the girl with her partner next to her and unaware of what's happening, some BDSM, and gangbangs.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3230270580
[h1]Verdict: Outstanding[/h1]
[b]Self Defense Dojo - Secret NTR Lessons[/b] may have a few issues, but it's so good it's very likely to be in my Top 10 list of Steam games released in 2024, if not the top in the list. Its solid gameplay, eye-catching art, and serviceable story make it a must-play for anyone who enjoys playing hentai games, especially if they are into netori.

Overall:  Nice game!  But can become quite tedious after a while.

Recommend!  (Not highly recommend due to reasons such as NTR scumbag and slight tedious chores)  The game has simple but original felt map and minigame art designs.  OST I've never heard before so it gives a fresh feel.  NTR is never wholesome but H*T nonetheless.  The game definitely has missable content/achievements, they don't explain how to obtain them but the name of the achievement gives it away at the very least so it has hidden elements, very game like vibes!  All in all, I enjoyed the game very much.  Definitely recommend and this will go on my Indies/DLSite Steam Library.",1
27686,"Seems to be using the same engine and functionality as Handyman Legend. It's also very similar in style. If you like HL, you'll enjoy this.",1
27687,"The game itself is really fun, nice art style, nice models and the gameplay is smooth so great for a top-down survival game.

However, putting every piece of content behind a pay-wall isn't the right move at all. Instead of doing this, make the game ¬£1-¬£2 and have a levelling system of some sort to unlock the guns, characters, maps and modes etc. This is the complete wrong way to make a game.

Also putting ""a Vietnamese prison cell filled with chromosome-divergent bonobos"" in your websites ""Who are we"" section probably isn't the right thing to put.

27729,"The game play feels new and there are some innovative elements to it. All in all it's a fun game worth the money.

positives:
[list]
    [*]unique/experimental game mechanics
    [*]very nice camera animations
    [*]nice use of post processing effects
    [*]attention to detail is high and stuff mostly seems to be actually modeled for this game, not just taken from some asset store. Kudos for that. Also nice how there's little stoppers on the moving-tower-block thing. Really cool little detail.
    [*]feels good to get the guy locked down with taser/slowing towers
[/list]

things that could be improved IMO:
[list]
    [*]wiggly canon. Like, why are you wiggling? Let me shoot that guy already. At first I thought the wiggling causes me to miss sometimes, which - to my relieve - wasn't the case. Less wiggle would be better IMO.
    [*]guy moving lanes randomly causing you to miss shots. I know this is part of the game play and this is what makes the game challenging. I just don't like the randomness of it. If there's a pattern I couldn't find it. Guy goes up at some random time causing your slowly moving bullet to miss. Argh! It's a bit frustrating at times to be honest. Couldn't there be some indicator that the guy is about to move? Maybe a small arrow telling me that the dude is about to go left? I'm not even sure my suggestion is a good one. That's the thing with ideas isn't it. They're just ideas. You need to test them and see if they feel right. All I can say for certain is that the element of randomly changing lanes has something frustrating to it (I wish it was more of a skill based kind of thing to be able to hit the guy, not luck based).
    [*]the wind tower. I hate it. I never felt like using it helped me much. I know, I know, it's good for preventing the guy from hitting the fast-blocks. But I'm trying to hit this guy with my super slow cannon here. And having the guy move because of this wind tower isn't helping me in that regard. Also, sometimes the dude is immune to the wind? like... why? How can I tell when he is and is not immune to wind?
    [*]too many icons and no tooltips at all. I get that this way it's easier to localize (ha! No Text at all!), but this is too much. I have no idea what those gauges at the bottom are trying to tell me. There's a green gauge popping up later in the game. It looks like a special ability kind of thing? So I click it and 3 more icons pop up. I'm trying to keep this guy from advancing and simultaneously I have to figure out what all those icons are trying to tell me. I click one and the gauge is lower now, so I guess I used it up but nothing happens? Now, finally, while writing this I am thinking maybe it is to reload the towers? Could that be it? I don't know. Also the gauges on the right are a mystery to me. I thought they're the dudes life, but that doesn't seem to be it. What are they?
[*]canon laser sequence. I took me way too long to figure out that I'm supposed to be using the laser to unblock tower-positions instead of trying to shoot the guy. That's on me maybe. But there could be some sorta arrow, right?
[/list]

Edit: I played a little more. I got used to the guy moving lanes randomly. There's some pattern to it after all, he won't change lanes immediately after changing lanes for example. So all good here. It's quite challanging. Currently stuck in level 20. I still don't know what the buttons above the green gauge do. But I'm having fun. Good BGM/sound effects!",1
27730,"Zomwick's a decent intro to tower defence games for kids. Only short and lacks variety but the core concept is interesting and there are some experimental/unusual mechanics which I did enjoy.

ZomWick's like a Tapper game but with only 1 bad guy, although the floor has boosts and you can install temporary turrets. Needs more variety. It's interesting but easy & slow moving. Kid friendly.

27740,"Generic platformer that can be quite frustrating due stage layouts.

Stages are selected from a menu in a linear order. There‚Äôs no big story here, you‚Äôre just trying to reach the finish line by jumping over chasms and on insects‚Äô heads.  

Everything looks generic due to the small variety of enemies and locations. You encounter a few creatures, such as wasps and cockroaches, and the locations offer very little.

Geko's only ability is to kill foes by jumping on them and climbing up the wall. Climbing is really bad; geko always slides down when you jump on a wall and you can't recover if you get hit while climbing. If you hold the jump button while killing an enemy, you will receive a small boost that will propel you a little higher. This method is often used to traverse chasms by jumping on multiple enemies. 

The game is frustrating because the majority of the stage is made up of holes into which you can easily fall.  Even layout doesn‚Äôt help because you have very small platforms with a threat in the middle. Every jump is made even harder with enemies that knock you right over the edge. You're not safe from climbing either; wall jumping mechanic is not good and you enounter slimy surfaces on which you constantly slide down. Of course, you need to do this while avoiding enemies and a pit below.

It's fine when precision platformers provide you the tools to overcome a problem and make the experience satisfying. Nothing here, just another stage with the same cheap hits and endless holes.

Death, thankfully, is not a big deal. You simply respawn at the last checkpoint after losing all three hearts. Extra hearts can be obtained by finding them within a stage or by catching flies. This is pointless because there‚Äôs no reward for grabbing all flies. 

When it comes to achievements, some are broken, specifically the ones for finishing a few stages without taking any damage. This could be due to a bug - or is it a feature? - that does not reset the amount of hearts when you quit and start a new stage.",0

27745,"A self-admittedly solo project, made predominantly to learn how to even make a game. And that inexperience certainly shows, with a lot of rudimental graphics and UI elements, some readability woes, slightly off hit detection, and ""cute"" little oddities like being able to shoot once during the pause menu and such. But even with all its obvious rookie errors, Vexed Heroes is a fun little bullet heaven game. By focusing on min-maxing a single weapon (one that has to be shot and aimed, so no auto-fire) and summons, the action can get quite frantic, though the enemy variety isn't high. There's also only 2 very similar stages, but at least the progression in terms of difficulty scaling seems virtually infinite.

Anyway, it certainly isn't a masterpiece, but it's not aiming to be one. Solo dev Mint has made a fun attempt at tackling the ever-growing bullet heaven genre for his debut, and for the price of just under 1 USD/EUR in the current Steam Sales, it's a good couple hours of entertainment.

27746,"Vexed Heroes is a fun top down bird's eyes shooter with cute graphics and unlimited re-playability. There are many ways too build your selected hero through the vast different permanent stat boost and in-round skills chosen on level ups. Great game, looking forward too future projects from this creator.",1
27747,"For its price this is a fun, charming and solid survivor game. The gameplay is enjoyable with enough skills and passives to choose from. Interresting addition that all upgrade have a little humor quotes what made you smile or laugh sometimes. The XP gain is not traditional survivor way, as you earn XP by killing enemies like in Diablo, however you need to collect the skull currency. With these skulls you can unlock more characters and get permanent passive upgrades, so the meta progress is presented. After 100+ survivor game I played this was a nice surprise, a little friendly charming cheap game.
Recommended.",1
27748,"I love the idea of infinite scaling. It makes me feels powerful the more I work on it.

2 problems though.
1. sound glitch
2. default attack not auto

Bored of other similar games but still want more? This game has different flavors to help changing the pace.",1
27749,Had a blast playing this game. Really enjoyed the graphics and the different synergies.,1
27750,"Fun shooter game with fun cute artwork. controls are smooth and the game plays nicely, 10/10",1
27751,"Great game. Completed a run on normal difficulty in 20 minutes. 25 to 30 minutes seems to be the norm for a full round.
Art style 10 of 10. I really love its spooky pixelart style.",1
27752,"A game which very much reminds me of a classic arcade experience. While I have only played it with mouse and keyboard, it feels like it would be quite comfortable with a controller.

The runs are not too long at ~30 minutes or shorter if you are ""better"" at the game. The variety of game mechanics during playtime is refreshing. I personally enjoy switching between various weapons and just winging it, or rerolling all my gems to upgrade the bow as high as possible and abusing it to focus completely on bosses when they spawn.

The way an upgrade always comes with a downgrade at the same time, makes it quite interesting to think about your current build, and gives you the chance to choose up-&downgrades that fit your playstyle best.

While it isn't in early access, I am happy that the developer seems intent to keep working on the game, and I am looking forward to the unlockables and features that will be added in the future.",1
27753,"The game is decent enough, Cool idea but it could have been done better. There are almost no synergies, would like to see an overhaul of the games upgrade system but that might be too much work.
 
Hope to see more from the dev",1
27754,love the style of the game not played for that long but i always judge games like this based on the meta (replay value) and there is no meta here basically so there is that. but game plays good not sure about the replay value though.,1
27755,"Hate Me Not is a surprisingly fun game from a new indie developer. It features roguelite elements and plenty of charm. The visuals are simple but captivating, and the audio fits perfectly without ever feeling out of place. The gameplay mechanics are satisfying and offer a good challenge. I really enjoyed my time with this game and recommend everyone give it a shot. It's evident that a lot of love went into this project, and it truly deserves more recognition!",1
27756,"Fun, small game with lovely monochromatic visuals.
There is just enough variety in enemies and weapons to hold my attention. Combine that with the overall rather relaxing pacing and short length of a single run and I find myself going back for another quick session. And another.
All things considered, it is a very pleasant experience.",1
27757,"Black & white graphic composition is perfect for this game. The pixel arts stole my heart. The variety of weapons and monsters is very satisfying, which means you can spend a lot of time to know them all. You can see that the authors put a lot of heart into this game. Fun and pleasant with some challenges. Everyone who loves shooting games should try it~",1

27771,"Unfortunately it's a no from me. I encountered various issues that made it more irritating than relaxing and overall wasn't a great experience. I think the game developer had the right idea, it just didn't come out as intended. The music audio is basically either blaring in your ears, or is off, there is no inbetween, the slider is basically just either 0% or 100-300% volume. Also some of the objects are very small in hitbox and are constantly moving, which makes it difficult to move them, not to mention that figuring out where to use them is completely random and illogical, and it makes it very difficult to enjoy. Overall, not recommended. This extends to the full version of the game as well.",0

27774,"There is no option for thumbs neither up or down, so I had to give this game a thumbs up, but with reserve. The graphics of the game are nice, there is no censorship in the game, but no animations either.  The biggest problem is the card battle mechanics. You must win each round of card battle to progress the story. You may want to strategize all you want, the outcome is greatly affected by AI that makes it very hard to win battles, you may have to redo the same battle over and over again before you finally win the round.  You win the round by removing all the points before the end of the battle, you lose if your opponent still has 1 point left.  So your success in this game relies heavily on luck more than strategy.  I believe this game would be more fun (and less frustrating) if it was easier to progress.  Having the scenes animated would be a nice bonus, a better reward for winning the round. Overall, this game deserves a 5/10.",1
27775,"Very shallow mechanism and poorly designed UI. Can you imagine you need to double click to use a card?

27777,"[b]""From corporate slave to sex slave in an isekai world with hot fantasy girls, improvements!!!""[/b]

[h1] Review [/h1]
An interesting mix between a deckbuilding game with the basic elements of rock-paper-scissors, in which the classic isekai story is presented, the MC is transported from him office to a alternative world where he is almost a god since he can give life force to all the girls he has sex with him and receive a creampie.

The story, due to its simplicity, remains in the background and is limited to narrate the adventures of Mc through various areas in which he meets the 4 different girls, as for the gameplay is a deckbuilding game in which you assemble your deck of 15 cards to fight against the girls before a sexual event, These fights are divided into phases attack and defense in which you have to play cards of different colors of the attacker and defender to do damage, a bit similar to rock paper scissors as there are only three colors available, and in case of being the same color damage is nullified parry style.
The first is interesting but unfortunately that's where all the gameplay is, the same cards that are at the beginning are the same at the end there is no possibility of unlocking new ones as you advance in the story, the only way to improve your deck is to upgrade the cards you already have, as this will make them do more damage or recover more health, but this aspect also has a flaw because to upgrade the cards you need two copies of the same quality to make one of higher quality, but these can only be purchased in the store at a price of 1000 coins, and another 1000 coins to refresh the store to buy another copy, in addition to the price of upgrading the cards, making a very slow system to level up and that requires a lot of grinding because the victories give you very few resources as 2000 coins or 3500 in the last levels.

As for the visual aspect the game is nice the background design is good and the female characters are varied and quite lewd, plus they have very professional Japanese voice acting that gives them a personality very consistent with its design.

üîû[b]sexual content[/b]
Undoubtedly the most detailed and highest quality aspect of the game, there are a total of 4 heroines to have sex with and each of them has 4 sexual scenes, these are with image sequences (CG) in which they have changes of clothes and expressions to represent well the sexual act, these are accompanied by their appropriate voice acting very professional with his touch lewd that help to put very well the environment for manual labor, as the moans that emit are quite exciting, in terms of fetishes there is no great variety as most are vanilla sex scenes with some services as; blowjobs, footjobs, paizuris, etc.
The game has its own gallery where you can watch the complete scenes or just the CG.

üí≠[b]Conclusion[/b]
A game with a gameplay that promised a lot with its style of gameplay but was overshadowed due to the lack of progression and how slow and tedious it is to level up the cards, some of these aspects can be improved by simply increasing the amount of rewards by x5, Also fix some cards because a lot of 3 star and 4 star cards have the same damage values making it absurd to level them up, even so the sexual content is worthy of recommendation, as it is quite pleasing to have such good voice acting and good art, so on offer is worth buying it to add it to your nightly library and enjoy those 16 good sex scenes.

27778,"An Isekai Adventure with Mixed Gameplay! „ÉΩ(¬¥‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢`)„ÄÅ

[h1][b][1] Intro : [/b][/h1]
Bareback Reincarnation: It's Just That Easy to Brave a Different World is a game that throws players into a fantasy realm as a corporate slave turned traveler with unique powers. Developed by Ex-Erotia and published by BokiBoki Games, this title offers a combination of card battles and narrative exploration. The premise follows the protagonist's sudden transportation to an Isekai during overtime work, where he discovers his extraordinary abilities tied to ""magical essence"" and skill enhancement for female characters, all without causing pregnancy.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience : [/b][/h1]

The game's unique concept brings both positive and negative aspects to the forefront. On the positive side, the audio and video quality are commendable, creating an immersive experience. The interspersed card gameplay provides an extra layer of engagement and strategy, adding playability. The character design and charm of the four female characters are also highlighted, each with their distinct personalities and backgrounds. The narrative introduces Meili, Kalia, Freya, and Farr, each with their own unique attributes, adding depth to the adventure.

However, the game's gameplay mechanics have received mixed feedback from players. Some users have expressed frustration with the high luck factor in combat, making battles feel inconsistent. Additionally, the pacing of the game, especially the slow action in battles, has led to complaints about the time it takes to complete each round. The gold coin farming aspect of the game has been criticized for being tiring, affecting the overall enjoyment. While the concept of utilizing the protagonist's unique abilities is intriguing, the execution has led to gameplay difficulties for some players.

In terms of progression, the game seems to offer a reasonable playtime of around 3 hours. The initial stages are manageable, but feedback suggests that the difficulty spikes as the game progresses, posing challenges for players who may not be well-versed in such mechanics. Despite this, there is an acknowledgment that the game has potential for those who enjoy strategic and challenging gameplay. Some users appreciate the complexity and find it suitable for shrewd players with a knack for mastering game mechanics.

[h1][b][3] Verdict : [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Bareback Reincarnation presents an Isekai adventure with a unique twist, blending card battles with a fantasy narrative. The game's strong points lie in its character design, audio-visual quality, and the intriguing abilities of the protagonist. However, the gameplay experiences some setbacks due to its luck-based combat, slow pacing, and potential grinding aspects. While the game offers an engaging experience for those who appreciate intricate mechanics, it might not be the ideal choice for players seeking a more casual and streamlined gameplay experience.

27779,"My friend, amazing friend we call Drunk Fuck, or others call him that, paid for this game for me on my birthday and I told him I would 100% complete it as a joke, not thinking he would actually buy me a  hentai game, now after getting the game on  January 31st 2024 and playing  on February 24 2024, I can say that I heavily appreciate my friend  and hope the  friendship lasts forever. Thank you, drunk, for buying me ""Bareback Reincarnation  -  It's Just That Easy To Brave A Different World.""",1
27780,"I got this game for shts and giggles and it‚Äôs actually a lot of fun. Wish I could give some suggestions to the creator. 

1: lamp doesn't light up at night
2: should add Christmas lights/LED for building
3: I can‚Äôt seem to edit an already placed item only able to delete it, would be nice to be able to edit a placed item already like it‚Äôs depth.
4: should add a key bind/ability to change menu
5: more landscapes because they are nice:)

I got tons more ideas but these are probably the most beneficial 

100% recommend this game",1
27781,"hey screenshot lovers, press H key then we will be happy!

hey Friedemann, this kind of info is THE THING you have to tell us.
(and thanks for making this lovely game!)",1
27782,"SUMMERHOUSE is a quaint and relaxing little game with an enchanting art style.
Or rather, it's about 80% of a game.

Keeping in mind that it's a one-man project, there are certain glaring things missing from it that I personally would have made sure to add before release.

- The ability to simply click to drag an object to move it is just a strange feature not to include, and makes every action twice the amount of work it should be.

- The available selection of items to decorate with is simply too small most of the time. Some strange choices were made by the designer of which item varieties there are enough of and which not - there are three parasols, but only one (strangely huge) plastic chair and one plastic table to put under them. There are several advertisement signs but only one lamp, and none of them light up at night. Even just different colour varieties of items to pick from would add loads of artistic freedom.

- The UI falls short. There is no scroll bar and scroll sensitivity is low. Items of wildly different sizes show up as the same size in the menu, so you have no idea what you're getting. Items are also highly pixelated in the menu to the point of being unrecognizable at times. Menus will frequently reset to the top half the time, and several times they bugged out completely.

- The textures of placeable items frequently clash with each other's meshes. Certain items that are supposed to be stuck to a wall can not be put at the correct depth to actually stick to the wall, either sitting inside or floating in front of it. Side scrolling reveals that the sides of any wall block or roof block are completely untextured.

So after that laundry list of problems, do I recommend the game?

Yes. It's gorgeous and meditative. It's an impressive effort for one man to have made. 
Really, my only hope is that the author continues to fix the problems above and add more items/colour options.
With these issues adressed the game would be simply excellent.",1
27783,"This is an extremely cute house building game. One thing however, I did find it a little frustrating if I place down an item then wanting to move it, I'd have to delete the item then go back into the item menu and select it from there. Another thing is I wish we could choose the colour of items. Certain items are one colour in menu (take example the graffiti) then it's a different colour once you place it. The tutorial is also a little lacking. It can be confusing sometimes with the popups. I think there should be a quick tutorial to show how to play the game.

Overall though, I enjoyed playing this game.",1
27784,"So, I bought the game the moment it released, and I think I am going to sink a lot of hours into this game. 
Its a relaxing, creative building simulator. Build your house how you want it and make it however you want!
Think townscaper, but just the house. 
During my playtime I could just feel myself relax to the music and the visuals. Even when I made something that arguably looks bad, It still has its charm in this game.
The only real feedback I would have is to have more blocks to make your house even better. Or give tools to the community so they can create more models on the workshop to be used in the game.
All in all, I can recommend it!",1
27785,"only real fair dinkum blokes will understand the simple pleasure of sitting on Vergil's plastic deck chair, in a ramshackle corrugated iron shed, during a rainstorm

what more do ya need in life",1
27786,"A very relaxing and simple straight-to-the-point sandbox game about just laying back and enjoying that warm, digital breeze while building some houses.
I can't help but love it.

It's not the type of game to keep you engaged for the ""long run"", instead more like a ""fun run"".
Sincerely, Summerhouse is best enjoyed in small, few, compact sessions with a hot cup of coffee on a hot summer evening.
Strong recommendation!",1
27787,"Chill.
Basic.
And super relaxing.

A little house/neighborhood builder.
No pressure, no time limits, no mobs coming to wreck what you build.
Just pixelated creativity.

Pick your map, and build your dream house or farm or row of shops.

It is basic- don't expect a million choices like massive city builders might have. But see what you can create with what is there, and what new blocks and character you can unlock to use.

[b][u]***Accessibility***[/u][/b]
Well, it can be played with one hand. So there is that.

No text or UI scaling.

No color-blindness settings, which could be an issue for people with certain forms of color-blindness. You will have to rely on your computer's system settings for color-blindness settings to adjust things.

The art may be difficult for some people with low vision to be able to easily tell the difference between different blocks or decorative items- even with pixelization toggled off.

There is no voice acting, other than the developer giving a very short ""Hi!"" at the beginning of the game, right after launching. Nothing that affects game-play. Should be very playable for Deaf or HoH players.

Controls are a tad awkward and not intuitive, can be a little confusing at times.
**************************************************************************************************

All that said, the game is by a solo dev, and is very new.
It runs well on my older desktop (i9 9900K/2070 RTX Super/ 16 GB DDR4 RAM/ Windows 10), but I wouldn't count on it running well on an absolute toaster (see the required system specs on the store page).

There are some guides being published for the game, some are helpful, some not so much (true for any game on Steam).

Very casual and chill creative art experience for killing time and just relaxing. I see a user-defined ""city-builder"" tag some gamers have applied, but it really isn't that. It is a creativity thing, not a ""build and manage a city"" thing.
Don't expect an AAA studio game experience, expect a cute, casual, chill indie game experience, and enjoy it for what it is. 

Definitely recommended for folks who just want something creative to relax with after a long day.
Full price is worth it, on sale, snag it right away.

(Quick edit to fix a few typos and autocorrect fails)",1
27788,"I saw others play this game and it screamed Cozy to me. It is in fact cozy however its not my cup of tea. I can't put my finger on it but I grew bored rather quickly. I unlocked all of the bonus characters and used a clicking Macro for the 10K achievement as there is no way I would play long enough to get it.

HOWEVER I see no reason to down vote this game. I see the appeal and its absolutely beautiful, just not for me.",1
27789,"Easy, fun, relaxing, heartwarming. You can tell someone put their whole heart and soul into this game from the second you open it up. This might be my favorite little building game ever, and it JUST came out!! Absolutely incredible. I highly recommend this game. If you're even slightly skeptical about a new release, don't be. Try it. Do it. You'll be so happy you did. Believe me. Besides the heartwarming description, the designs of the pieces and depth of the blocks are AMAZING. 3d pixel environment blew my mind. Its absolutely gorgeous. I am personally begging you to play this game and just relax for a little while, breathe and smell the roses and remind yourself that its okay to zone out and build a summer house.",1
27790,"Just soothing and beautiful. Thank you Friedemann! Feel free to offer additional objects and scenery as DLC over time.

Hint for everyone, there are some shortcuts:
H - Go to panorama modus and enjoy your scenery
K - Change the map-style and keep all objects",1

27795,Relaxing game to pass the time with when you're feeling a bit down. Definitely worth the price - support indie developers!,1
27796,"SUMMERHOUSE is an Incredibly calm and relaxing game. It's open-ended design allows for a lot of creativity. Although there are a couple limitations in the game, they end up furthering the player's creativity by forcing the player to think outside the box and come up with new strategies for building their summer house. The game has beautiful graphics and a pretty nice option to change them if you aren't particularly fond of the pixelized style.

Although the game could benefit from some improvements to the UI, better explained controls, and having other controls explained at all. The ability to disable the UI by pressing 'H' now has a pop-up, which alleviates some of my problems with the UI, but there are still improvements to be made.

Overall, this game is a nice, relaxing experience that I am sure I'll return to at later dates to get a fix of that cozy juice. The first update gives me hope that we will see the issues I brought up addressed fully with time, but nevertheless this game is an immediate recommendation.",1
27797,"very pretty and relaxing! love the animation & visuals and it's very easy to play. 
however there are some suggestions :
- it'd be better if we can hide the tool bar so we can take a screenshot without the toolbar appears
- a scroll pad to make it easier to find an asset on search menu
- all the neon signs and lamp post also glow in night",1
27798,"This game is very good. I love the music and the art style, but there is only one thing i worry, dear devs please don't add content with micro transaction to purchase specific items like SIMS.

I love this game, I've played Elden Ring for too long.",1
27799,"Beautiful and soothing, tiny city builder; a very enjoyable game that lets you build anything you want in a variety of environments.

Combining different objects might unlock a new variation of one of the objects used. You can change the weather or time to see your creations in a different light. While there are no limits to what you can build, you still might run out of ideas as there aren't that many things to build with, so hopefully more will be added in the future. It would also be nice to see some different environments to build in or more weather options.

Overall, I consider this a perfect game to unwind and be creative with when you just want a break from stress, so I definitely recommend it.",1
27800,"[i]SUMMERHOUSE[/i] is a creative pixel game where you build small-scaled lived-in buildings without restrictions or limits to your creativity. 

[h3]Game-play, Graphics & Features[/h3]

As an artist, first and foremost games in this genre tickle my fancy. In [i]SUMMERHOUSE[/i] you craft small-sale lived-in houses, cafe‚Äôs or stores without restrictions or limits. Choose from four main environments; a lake, the city, the desert or a grassy scene. The game also has some secrets to uncover as you play and pair certain items together. 

If you're stuck on getting certain achievements or unlocking secret items browse the community guides, there are some very helpful ones to guide you! 

You can build whatever you can imagine in this game. Place objects anywhere you wish and change the depth of them to make them come forward (like 3D) or recede so parts are behind others. You can change the weather to suit the mood you're in, whether it is a moon-lit night, a sunny afternoon or a rainy day. Plant trees, grass, flowers and place rocks. There is some wildlife and insects such as butterflies, birds, a cat and even a ghost. 

There are lots of save slots (20) so you can do lots of different creative designs and not feel like you're running out of room. 

I do hope they put out some dlc in the future or add mod support for more content to allow us to build even more things or have more variety. Content such as animal packs or more lighting options. But what is included is a good selection to start with. 

My first design‚Ä¶but check out the Steam community or subreddit on Reddit for some truly epic builds. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3234826340

[h3]Overall Experience[/h3]

This game is truly relaxing and enjoyable to play. No restrictions, pure creativity and beauty. A wholesome game for everyone to enjoy at a great price with very high re-playability. üé®

27801,Great game! It would be even better if the lamp can actually light up at night and sometimes there is bug when controlling the depth. Hope more elements will be added into this game!,1
27802,"It's decent, great idea, and every item has been polished. But I would say it doesn't give you a lot of creative freedom, such as being able to change the colours or having more options for lighting during night time. What you basically get as what you can access in the demo. Play the demo, and it you find yourself getting bored, I'd hold off until it is updated more.",0
27803,"TL:DR Beautiful aesthetic and great concept but the user interface (UI) needs a bit more work.
I played with a mouse and keyboard - not sure if it is better on a controller.

I found the UI a little frustrating - from the fact that you can only build in a line or straight up (even though blocks seem to be 3D) to the really counter-intuitive and laborious way of finding the blocks you need (you have to scroll through the whole list each time and it doesn't remember where you last were - so you can't easily get the next block in the series). This game could be absolutely wonderful with just a little more work and testing. 

I'm also confused why some blocks like doorways seem to be only place-able slightly in front of other assets, but not in them - e.g. grated doors that show the background through the gaps until you put a wall behind it- where then it just shows bricks instead of being a doorway in the wall; or graffiti only being visible on some parts of a rock formation but not on others.

I can see how this could be relaxing and I found the new blocks popping up delightful (if again feeling a bit random on what pops up and what doesn't). However, for me the UI issues were a bit of a deal-breaker as they caused stress and frustration.

I do hope the creator keeps working on it and fixing some of the bugs at least - I look forward to seeing how this evolves (if it does)

The way it is now though, I don't think I can recommend it. I hope that changes!",0
27804,"This was a game I was so excited to try when I first saw it previewed.  I think this is more of a creative exercise than a game, in that there are no goals - simply a blank canvas and building blocks to play with to create a cute scene.  It's so very intuitive and I think ANYONE could get in this and make a really nice looking scene easily, that's how well done this is.

I've spent an hour and a half just playing around, with no real goal - just placing blocks and seeing what the end result was.  I even built one scene entirely by hitting the ""random"" button and placing whatever piece it gave me.  The end result was always pleasing to look at and fun to put together.  It was also really fun to discover new ""character"" blocks by placing certainly blocks together.  

The art is gorgeous, colorful and a joy to look at.  I think if you are someone who enjoys being creative OR you're someone who likes to have something to mess around with while you do other things (talk on the phone, listen to something, etc) this is going to be a hit with you.  It doesn't have to be a time sink if you're looking for something short to do, or if you want to spend literal hours with this, you absolutely could.

I encountered no bugs, no issues and the game is solidly well made.  My only wish is that it will get an update or DLC with new environments and building blocks.",1
27805,"Lovely little game, I'd love to see an update where we can adjust the color and size of the objects! Keep up the good work Friedemann :D",1
27806,"More of a sandbox builder than a traditional ""game"", SUMMERHOUSE is perfect for winding down & relaxing. Other than the achievements for unlocking specific building elements, there is no objective to the game - you simply build to your hearts content. While I would like more variety in items to build with & perhaps environments, at the price point of $5 USD I feel like this game offers plenty.

My only complaint with the game is the difficulty navigating the menus to find the exact items I want to use. I am not sure how to make it more efficient but I often found myself looking in the incorrect category for specific items.

For anyone who needs some downtime & a game where they can chill without stress, I would absolutely recommend this one.

[b]update soon with comments on accessibility[/b]",1
27807,"For a game with very little rules, rails, or progression, there's a surprising amount of drive and incentive. Like other creative canvases like Such Art or Minecraft (in Creative move), goals and designs emerge from the simple act of exploration. The simple beauty of the pixel art make the achievement of what you make that much sweeter.",1
27808,"You could close your eyes, randomly click around and the result would still look pretty.
This game makes me feel nostalgia for things I never knew I missed.",1
27809,"- Hello, I really like this game, SUMMERHOUSE. It is impossible to describe how many features are already available at the moment and I really want to help it to promote the game industry. So I really hope it will reach the creator Friedemann. I want to express what is worth adding and fixing in this game. Let's start.


- Adding more

1-More items and locations. 
 Despite the fact that what buildings are created by players at the moment, it would not be enough to increase the stock of items in the various tabs, such as in the tab ""Decoration Blocks"". I'm not even asking to add a workshop so that players can not only add their save with buildings so still and add their own items and just increase the banal number of items, because for 4.99$ it is a shame. I would like to sprawl in the possibility of building anything. Well, and would also have more terrain and add a tab with people to be able to place them near the houses creating a sense of habitat.

2-The ""Control"" tab. 
 What is really not in such a cool game is just a tab with ""Control"" seemingly insignificant tab in the settings, but the newcomer who would like to master the game and immediately know all the ""Hot Keys"" this button is really not necessary. And that yourself to look in the guides in steam and try to learn the purpose of keys is not pleasant.

3-Reassign keys.
 Speaking a little earlier I talked about the ""Control"" tab and I would like there to be an opportunity to reassign keys. I really miss this function.
 
4-Add more features.
 I do not know how personally other players, but I would like to be able to change the size of any object / bush / wall and so on. And also to mirror them not only horizontally but also vertically, as it will be more convenient UwU. Well and it would be desirable to increase the number of layers. Oh and one more detail, I would very much like to reduce the picture so that the whole location was on one screen. It's just inconvenient that you need to take 3-4 screenshots of the whole location.


- Bug fixes
 This will be a short section, I just want to point out that I found only one bug and that is that the panels in the ""Nature blocks"" and ""Walls blocks"" tabs are shifted to the right. Because of which I can not select the item that I need and have to go to other tabs to make this bug disappear. Well, and probably will find some other bugs.


-End
 At the end of the review I would like to say ""ADD WORKSHOP, ADD WORKSHOP, ADD WORKSHOP"". But that's about it.

27810,"This game is so cute! It's a great game to just sit back, play it, and listen to the music.

The amount of items available is definitely enough to make pretty much anything you want.

If you want a game to just relax and build some houses, get it!",1
27811,"Alright Friedemann, have your big chai latte; I made an ugly house!

Edit: In all seriousness, this game lacks some basic QOL features.  Can the key bindings be shown/edited?  Can esc close the current window instead of bringing up the menu screen?  If you disable the ""pixelation"" option, can this be reflected in the build windows as well?

This will be appreciated once you're done with your large chai latte, Friedemann.",1
27812,"Great and relaxing game, there could be many more features to make the game more cozy tho.

- Items being able to change colours
- Being able to rotate items
- Being able to make chimney generate smoke
- Change wind intensity
- Being able to add a lot of fireflies and/or butterflies
- Birds getting on the ceiling would be cute
- Being able to add your own textures for flags, posters or graffitis

That's all I could think of at the moment
",1
27813,Incredible game and the sound design is on point too. I would love to see some more lighting options like lamps and other decorative lights in the future. I would greatly recommend playing it if you like cozy but also creative no-pressure games.,1
27814,"Personally I think the game has a good premise and I really love the game, but it comes with a major flaw that I can't seem to work around. And that is that the game has very little options for how to build the different buildings. I think that if they had just added a feature like controlable length and height to roofs and walls, and maybe ability to change texture and colour, it would be amazing for the game. 

So at the moment I wouldn't recommend this game to people, but if it did get an update with new stuff and more variation I could definitely recommend it to someone.",0
27815,"This is such a cute game that is littered with problems. I REALLY wanted to enjoy it but the game makes it so hard.

Why do NONE of the pieces line up? You basically need to make the houses like the ones in the promotional images or cover up every single join with other bits and pieces. Did you think there would be a stone walled roof that matches the brick pattern you used for the walls? Because there isn't. Did you think the smaller wooden walls would match the pattern of the bigger walls you used for the base? Because they don't. 

There are also only a handful of pieces you can use to build. It's so limiting to have a single wooden roof, and that wooden roof doesn't match the wooden walls. It needs to be completely covered in signs and other bits to make it look at all neat. 

WHYYYYY does scrolling take SO long? It would have been simple to just make it faster but it's painful trying to scroll down the menus to do anything. Especially if you want to swap back and forth between things further down the menus. 

The trailer also seems a little disingenuous, although probably not intentionally. ""You can build houses in a variety of levels, such as the sea, the mountains, the city, or the desert."" Yeah you listed the only 4 locations. It really makes it sound like there are more than those 4. 

I hope this doesn't discourage the dev from making more games, It seems like they really liked this game. But it feels more like they built a game for themselves.",0
27816,"Summerhouse is a relaxing building program with a limited selection of building blocks, many of which have to be unlocked by placing the right combinations of blocks next to each other.
It is a very soothing experience, and you can create some really nice-looking buildings with it.
It's not a game with goals and does not pretend to be one. It does accomplish exactly what it set out to do.",1
27817,"Exactly as it's described. There is no real gameplay or goals, just make cute houses and buildings. If you go into it with these expectations, you'll really enjoy it! If you're expecting something more complex, it's not for you. The price is reasonable given the work put in.

All y'all creative, imaginative, and/or relaxing folks: SUMMERHOUSE will be a nice little addition to your steam library. I hope more content is added!",1
27818,"I got gut-punched by pure vibes for the price of a coffee. I can't imagine a better deal for a game, absolutely recommended.",1
27819,"Great calming experience. So tranquil. Loved the view, the music, most of all I loved the sounds of buttons and clicks, soooo satisfying. I wish I could export images/gifs without UI to set as my wallpaper",1
27820,"A simple, cute, and utterly charming sandbox game. Its very easy to just zone out and build and would recommend to anyone who like very chill and simplistic builder games.",1
27821,"What a fantastic little building game. My buildings may look bad, but they are [b]MY[/b] cozy buildings.",1
27822,"This game is WONDERFUL. So calm, so pleasant, you can really get into it and build a lot of fun things. I hope there will be more items to play with eventually and I also wish we could pick up items we've already placed. I recommend this game so much anyway for all who enjoy building things!",1
27823,"Unwinding! It's now my go-to-game whenever I want to escape from other nerve-wracking apps! )': 
Please add more blocks/elements/entourage @Friedemann! Awesome game! <3",1
27824,"Im a massive fan of this game, played the demo and was anxiously waiting for the release.
Big fan of the ways of combining and placing objects, allows for a lot of small details to flourish.
The unlocks add more flavour and personality to the world too, its really nice.

If the author is looking for changes or advice then heres some things id suggest!
A ""superflat"" world to allow for unlimited creativity, maybe adding some grass or hill panels to allow for terrain customisation.
And something to go on the side of buildings! Perhaps a fire escape or window box? I'd love to see someone lounging on a fire escape or something like that lol :)

Overall, great game and its a lotta fun! :D Thanks dev!",1
27825,"This game is so zen, I hope they add more building styles and settings to it, would definitely spend more time with this game then!",1
27826,"A beautiful and relaxing game! Hopefully this will get more updates, most notably a better item selection feature (something like hold right click to open a radial of the category you have selected), a way to rotate items so we can place things sideways, and a colour picker.",1
27827,"been playing for a few hours and i like how relaxing this game is, its simple, and its a great game to unwind to... BUT WHERE IS THE CAMERA MODE??? I'd like to take a picture of my builds without the UI in the way D:",1
27828,"Positives:
- Low cost.
- Nice art style.
- Unlocking the new objects was quite fun.

Negatives:
- Controls are really bad - to find something to place you can either right-click a dozen times to get to it (and you will probably overclick and need to go round again).
- UI is really hard to use - the objects are stored in thrown together menus that scrolls painfully slow.
- No further customisation tools like the ability to recolour.
- No convenience tools that would be expected, like the ability to move something that has been placed.
- Unlocking new objects has bugs that meant I had to spam objects to trigger them to be unlocked.

It lacks a lot of content, which isn't terrible for a low cost game, but it isn't relaxing to play because the controls are horrendous. The art is generally quite nice, but the UI, controls, gameplay, are really badly designed.",0
27829,"Very Summer. Very House. Very fun. 

I've spent a few hours enjoying this and crafting the most of what I can with what's given! It's a beautiful game and I would gladly pay for DLC with additional content or play the game to earn more. It's a great game!",1
27830,"This is not a completed game and is full of bugs! I got enough money to purchase all fishing spots (which seems to be endgame) from accidentally claiming the reward for a daily quest over and over (I thought it was stuck, but it gave me money for each click). Most of my playtime comes from when I launched the game and went to do chores. It's a very cheap game, but unfortunately I can't recommend buying in its current state.

That being said, if some more effort was put in to finish development, flesh out the NPC scripts and perhaps create more innovative game-play than just mashing F for battles and pressing F to time catches (with no variation on timings currently), this could be a great game. I adore the cat and fox, and the general art style. To the dev: please keep working on this game!",0

27837,"[h1]I'TS VACATION TIME AT PINECREEK HILLS NATIONAL PARK AGAIN![/h1]
Vacation Adventures games have become a cult classic over the years. There's just something about these games that keeps us fans, game after game. I've always said that playing a new Vacation Adventures: Park Ranger game is like putting on your favorite sweater every year; it always puts a smile on your face.

You can play in Casual Mode (untimed-faster hint recharge), Challenge Mode (timed-normal hint recharge), or Extreme (timed mode, all wildlife & recyclables must be found) FYI: In Extreme Mode, there are 30 Items to find versus 18. There are 21 Achievements to earn for completing various tasks such as finding Wildlife, buying souvenirs, or finishing a mini-game quickly. You can purchase Park Souvenirs with the points earned and store them in a Display Room.

Each scene has several Wildlife Animals to find that are shown as silhouettes in a box to the left of the word search bar, and when all the animals have been spotted, the doors will close. There is a Wildlife Notebook that allows you to see illustrations of all the wildlife you have found.¬†

You will also Recycle cans, bottles, corrugated boxes, and paper found in each scene, and when all recyclables have been found, the recycle Can icon will be displayed as full. Some of the trash items are located within Zoom Zones as well.

There are 16 Photo Op scenes that allow you to take a photo for your Album whenever you see the Camera Icon, so don't forget to keep an eagle eye out for those Photo Ops.

You will earn an Eagle Eye achievement if you don't use either the Hint Magnifying Glass, which shows the location of a single random item, or the Mega Hint feature, which shows the location of all available items from the list. You'll earn a Bronze Star for completing the Search, a Silver Star if you find all Wildlife OR all Recyclable Items, and a Gold Star if you find all Wildlife AND all Recyclable items. (Extreme mode requires you to find all recyclable items & wildlife.)

Words listed in Blue are Tasks that require an interaction of some type, and words in Red are hidden inside or behind things. Most of the scenes have at least one Zoom Zone (indicated by sparkling stars) that has hidden items and sometimes includes Recyclables or Wildlife. Levels can be replayed to better your time/score (timer counts up, not down) or pick up missing recyclable items or wildlife, and the items to find are different each time you replay it.

After each Search Scene, you'll play a Mini-Game such as Placing Map Shapes, Spot The Difference, Word Search, or several different types of Jigsaw Puzzles (Rotate Squares, Swap Tile Sections, Flipsaw, Slider Puzzles, etc.)

[b]Collector's Edition Extras:[/b]
30 Main Levels +8 CE Levels, 18 Wallpapers, 20 Music Soundtracks w/player (that familiar Vacation Adventures soundtrack is called Bluewaters Heaven btw) 21 Achievements, 16 Photo Op Screenshots (available in Photo Album) 16 Gift Shop Souvenirs with Display Case, 126 Wildlife Critters to find (available in a Photo Album) 48 Replayable Mini-Games.

edit : The dev has responded and is planning on making changes so please check the Prologue out for yourself, especially since it is free. Thank you, have fun.
----------------------------------------------------------
 Small Kingdoms Prologue was ok but felt very simple to me, like a casual beer and pretzel strategy game. It was nice also that they gave us some achievo's to chase without annoying grind to unlock.

 The gameplay loop wasn't that bad, build up a city, build some troops for defense and more troops to fill your armies to attack. But it felt clunky and seriously lacked any real strategy and that was very bad for a game like this calling itself a Strategic Simulation video game.

 If the full release version does not fix this issue then I do not recommend this game. I'll be honest, I feel a little bad for leaving a negative review since they gave everyone the prologue for free, but thats not the point of reviews eh.

 You can play the prologue for free for yourself, or watch a youTGube video to see if you disagree with me.

27859,I can't recommend this game with it being so short as in it only took me 18 mins. There is no settings option and it is sad that one of the achievements is to play the game for at least 5 mins. There is music while you play but no animation of any kind.,0
27860,"Sex Story - Cuckold Life - Episode 1 is a visual novel with adult content.

The game offers multiple choices, but if you don't go with what the developer had in mind, the main female character just does whatever she wants and uses 'I want to do it that way, cuck,' as an excuse quite literally. With this in mind it makes the entire game just a snooze-fest of text. The game has no animations whatsoever, the models are quite good, but gosh the poses are terrible. Also the whole plot is just bizarre, characters are taking this way too casually, some of the plot progresses way too fast, there is yet again transition to pictures of the male character 'finishing' about 20 paragraphs or so before it actually happens in the story... you get the idea.

To crown things off, the game has no settings. The text is painfully slow (and the animation used to write it on screen is aggravating to look at,) the back button backs entire sections of the story and to top it all off, the last achievement took TWO ENTIRE RUNS + 5 MINUTES OF SPAMMING AND ALT-TABBING TO UNLOCK. Way to make a disappointing game even more frustrating.

Overall, the story has/had potential, but this first iteration is not it. Poorly coded.",0
27861,"So I've been married along time.. like A LOT of years, and if you're in prison... I mean married like me you know how frustrating it can be.. The Wife always has a headache, the kids are little demons running around, acting like animals, breaking your stuff and always requiring more and more money.. You can do like the Turpin's, break out some chains, restrict their eating and only give out the very minimal amounts of love and caring..  Although I wouldn't recommend it as they were sentenced to 25 years to life.. OH BOY!!!!  Anyway, as a married couple sometimes things get a little slow in the bedroom.. Sometimes need to be like Owen Hart and say ""enough is enough it's time for a fall!!!!""... wait that wasn't right.. Too Soon?  Anyway, being dead kind of sucks or so I've been told by the dead people who visit me at night and watch me pound the pud..  You know how hard it is to punch the one eyed clown, while you have an undead guy with half his head missing bemoaning how the afterlife sucks and he can't get tail anymore..  I'll let you know it's not easy...  So occasionally you have to find things to do to spark up the love life,, You can try dressing up, or buying a new car, or trying your hand at finding the next Julia Roberts (not the one in real life, but the one from Pretty Woman that somehow nabs the wealthy stockbroker, you know a lady of the night)  or you can try what my buddy tells me is the new yellow.. being a Cuckold..  If you can get over the thought of another guy pillaging your woman's poop deck,  it just might be the best medicine for a sorry love life.. I mean it worked for that dude who Let Dennis Rodman plow his wife, while he spent time chilling in the Worms mansion, watching his TV and crying in the closet while he choked the chicken..

The Story - 

Anyway, sad story aside, it brings me what you're all here for the main event,, the whole enchilada.. Sex Story - Cuckold life Ep 1..  The Story is what you'd expect from a game called Cuckold Life, it's the story of a married couple..  Adam and Nikki. Adam comes home early from a work trip he surprises Nikki.. After a few pointless scenes and text she decides to let her Boss give her the old Meat Rocket as a way of putting spice in their love life..  The game goes about how you'd expect from 2.99 cent visual novel.. Completely devoid of anything worth while.. and the translations are kinda lackluster..

Gameplay - 

Press the Space bar and read the REALLY slow moving text. Make some choices which have absolutely zero effect on the game..  Want your wife to wear black panties.. LOL.. no way bro she's going with Red..  If you can't figure out how to play this game in 2023, then I'm pretty certain you'd have some issues with staying alive if your body didn't' automate your breathing.. 

Pro's - 
Easy achievements
Counts toward the +1
Bewbs???

Con's - 
Broken achievement...  The one for finishing the story is broken, it took me a while to unlock it after playing through like 18 times, then it randomly unlocked in the middle of my fifth play through
no speed text or options at all
no animations (for 2.99 can't complain too much I guess) 
Weirdly worded text, probably translation issues.
Choices mean nothing....

Recommendation - 
The game has a few pros..  for starters the easy achievements..  play five minutes and finish the story (finish the story seems to be semi broken), the lack of options ANY options, is really frustrating, means sitting through the same boring story numerous times to unlock the finish the story achievement.. The fact that it's really cheap and adds a +1 to your library count is beneficial to game collectors, the fact you can get 100% completed game in under an hour is another benefit to achievement hunters.. If you're looking for a visual novel that is engaging and interesting, this isn't for you, if you're looking for a visual novel that tells a compelling story, this isn't for you.. If you want a +1 to either you're E-peen (game library) or your E-Scrot (Achievements), then by all means buy it.. if you care about any thing else,, just avoid it..  Snooch to the Booch",1
27862,"the lack of features missing from the basic kinetic novel is, to be frank, highly disappointing. It's a timed slideshow that you can't even click through.

27863,"So I agree that the game is short, but I knew that before I bought the game, so I didn't mind. Overall, I enjoyed the game. It hit all the marks for a cuckold fetish, and I enjoyed playing it. It is a story that you click through, and I doubt your choices really do anything, but it's still fun. I look forward to playing the next episode!",1
27864,"Recommended - marginally; something about these two (husband and wife) bothers me. First, the husband (Adam) is very casual about having his wife go to another man, send him pictures of them doing it, and cleaning her up afterwards. Next, the wife (Nikki) is also very casual about going out to cruise for sex with someone else while Adam eagerly waits at home to sniff her when she gets back. After already being out on the town with the girls tonight, Nikki arrives home, gets a call from the boss to come into the office, knowing perfectly well the real reason. With her hubby's help she picks out a slutty outfit and struts out to the office. Obviously, for these co-workers there's no worry about inappropriate work behavior or HR warnings because the Boss is ready and waiting and they get it done. Afterwards, Nikki takes the ""mess"" home to please Adam. End scene, husband and wife happy as clams, laying in bed together naked, commenting that they should do this again soon. No back story for the characters, no how or why.  Que up episode #2.",1

The game is literally unplayable I'm pretty sure the developer never play tests the game before launch.

This is one of those games that's just better played than explained.

What's here is a bit abstract with only a few clues to its (small) story. I think this kind of game is for a specific type of person, so maybe only some players will be able to appreciate the developer's vision.

27884,"A very surreal lovely little game. Played through it twice because I missed a collectable the first time around, but one playthrough of the game should take you around 12-15 minutes.

its short but enjoyable otherwise.",1
27886,"Rating: 7/10
I went into this game for some achievements and ended up discovering an interesting game. The story is confusing but you can make it out in details. It's abstract minimalism and the controls are janky but they kind fit the game. Since the game is abstract ,weird and in a way broken,and the levels are presented in this smaller compact way, the controls feel right for this type of game. 
It does well in telling its story ,of escape from reality using summer season as it's backdrop. 
It feels in a way and if you play the game since it's short, you will feel it too that the entire story was centered around escape from troubles of the real world. The story takes a darker turn but in all that ,the character you meet and talk to behind a summer landscape is always there to remind you, everything will be fine and i liked that touch. The game is only 15 minutes long but it does well to portray what it was trying to go and make your mind wonder about the story and maybe piece your tale together. Despite it's flaws it ends up being an interesting experimental ,mind you adventure with abstract themes. Worth playing if you are going into it ,expecting something abstract,experimental and that something that will make you think how the story and the world besides what happens in the game really is and is it any different from our world.",1
27887,"Another fine and interesting title from Lu.
It suffers from the problems of their previous games, since its the same engine. Control Delay, Rough Controls, janky camera movements in 'cutscenes'.
but it also features their unique story telling and engaging art. 
I'd really like to see a FULL title from Lu, a dating sim maybe, or an adventure game with better controls.
Since this game is free, you can play it, and if you like it, you can drop cash on their previous titles which are all very similar.",1

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Mellowollem is for lack of a better way to put it a tech demo.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Game play is extremely primitive. WASD or Arrow keys to move, Z to interact, and Space to advance the conversation. None of these keys can be remapped. You start off in what looks to be a hospital corridor. You can't open any of the doors. When you walk to the far door the scene changes. You see a woman on a beach. You walk up and talk to her, then you have to walk around the map and pick up watermelons, no reason, just pick up watermelons. You bounce back between a room with bunkbeds, the hospital corridor, and areas with the woman. There is no direction, just keep trying to activate things and when you get the right object(s) you advance. There is a hide and seek game where you have to find the woman. There is also a cat, but no explanation of why.

There is a small story you discover along the way.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
This plays like an assignment in a programming class. Create a game where the player picks up objects and plays hide and seek.

[h1]System Specs[/h1]
Intel i7-8086K Coffee Lake 6-Core 4.00GHz CPU
Crucial Ballistix Sport AT 2666 MHz DDR4 RAM (16GB x 2)

27929,"The problem I find here is that the prompts are WAY too repetitive. 

They're great for 1-minute games, but as soon as I pushed it to 2 minutes and further, it just never seemed to get any sort of new material at all. There were moments where we literally did the same actions for the same prompts, so it became almost trivial to stick to one or two decks in the same category without getting incredibly bored. The video game category is so... surface-level with its prompts that it almost feels insulting, but I understand if the casual folks won't get it.

Considering that they're also pushing this on the original phone version (which I did own) at the same price (all decks for $40), I only wonder if they couldn't go lower here due to price parity or they're counting on people who don't know any better to buy in for what appears to be a pretty content-rich party game.

Folks, either buy this for a significantly-reduced price or just don't bother.
Hell, if anyone else can make a better version of this, go right ahead.

Seriously, how are you going to charge us a $40 game and not even allow us to create teams and keep score in your own game? I literally can code chat GPT with python GUI to spit out a category and a person, item, or thing related to the category, while we still keep score on our dry erase board. At best, the game is maybe worth like $10.

27935,"[h2] If you are looking for a very tough word game and spatial puzzle game then this might be worth checking out but I just found it so difficult that it felt frustrating to me. [/h2]

Quadruzzle is a mixture of Crossword and spatial puzzle game where you are given four clues that each form a word, like in a crossword puzzle, but the letters are all jumbled up on a four by four grid, and you have to move the letters around to complete the word. 

Not only do you need to solve the clue to know what word to find on the grid, but then you have to arrange the letters by moving them around the grid with only one spare space, and this is so difficult. If you don't know the answer to the clue, there is the possibility of working it out from moving random letters around the grid until they change colour, and then you know it is in its correct position. 

Even if you do know the answers, putting them in their correct positions is incredibly hard as you will mess up the position of other words you have set up and it takes a certain kind of brain to be able to move the letters around successfully. 

There is only one puzzle a day, so if you complete that one, you need to wait until the next day to have a go at a new one. The grid shows the least number of moves possible, so you can aim for this if you like. 

[h1]üç≥Conclusionüç≥[/h1]
[quote][h2][b] There's nothing particularly wrong with the game as such. I haven't encountered a word game like this before so points for originality, but due to its incredible difficulty I didn't enjoy it. You will soon find out if you like it or not so do give it a try if you enjoy challenging word games, but it isn't the word part that is difficult, it is moving the letter around the grid that is the challenge. 

I think some of the achievements are a bit silly, relying on you to play on certain days of the year for example.

At first glance, its cartoonish visuals and playful design might lead you to think it's just another lighthearted game, but it masterfully marries the realms of fun and fear in a way I hadn't thought possible.

Each room, despite looking similar, brings its own set of intriguing challenges and puzzles that range from delightfully simple to devilishly complex. Playing with others only amps up the fun; trying to solve the puzzles cooperatively added another layer of excitement and unpredictability to the mix. One of the standout features for me is that no two playthroughs feel the same, ensuring fresh and new experiences every time you dive in.

A true five star experience, I'll be looking forward to the updates and next levels!",1
27938,"If you're looking to buy a backrooms game, please for the love of god, look for something else, this game is the definition of ASS. Usually these backroom games on steam you can have fun with, either that be playing with friends, having some fun on your first playthrough, and they can be pretty fun to go back and replay/speedrun. But not Poly Backrooms, this game has some of the worst AI I've ever seen in a game, and worst of all, it's so boring and such a slog to play through. I can't even imagine playing this game by yourself, I played with a friend and we still found it super boring.

If you're looking to 100% this game, there's an achievement where you need to beat a level 20 times, and with this game being boring, it's such a slog to do that. Me and my friend could legit only do 1-2 runs a day, after that we'd just quit throughout the next run because we'd get so bored and frustrated out of our minds.

I know this game is in early access, but this game really should've been developed a lot more before releasing it to the public, especially with only three levels, and TWO enemies. I'll give the game this, the first level was pretty fun to play for the first time, but when you enter the second level, the game just goes down hill there, being the most tedious fetch quest set in a maze. And replaying the first level isn't any fun. Also the price of the game should really get cut down, even if it's already somewhat cheap.

If you are considering buying this game, I'd recommend any other backrooms game, me and my friend have played a couple backroom games, and this one is without a doubt the worst one by a landslide (that we've played mind you). There might be worst, but i highly doubt it, this game isn't even laughably bad, it's just plain garbage.

I'm sorry for the devs, but the artstyle of this game is pretty unique and I quite like it. This game really should've had much more put into it before releasing it. If the devs fix up the current levels, add some new levels, make new unique mobs, new objectives and polish the game more, I could really this see game becoming an actually really good backrooms game, but in the state it's in right now, it's far from the truth. 

I really hope to see this game evolve over time so I could come back and update my review, but for now, I'd look elsewhere for a backrooms game.",0
27939,This is one of the more unique and actually cute Backrooms games I've played! It's fun to play with a group of friends to have some chaos and laughs! I am here for the takes on the Smiler and Bacteria and can't wait for more monsters and levels,1
27940,"In the vast landscape of internet lore, there exists a phenomenon that captures the imagination like no other - the enigmatic and mysterious realm known as the backrooms. A surreal journey through the labyrinthine corridors of this digital underworld reveals a tapestry of intrigue, fear, and fascination. As a self-proclaimed adventurer of the virtual unknown, I find myself irresistibly drawn to the uncanny allure of the backrooms.

The backrooms, a seemingly endless network of interconnected, dilapidated rooms and hallways, have become a digital subculture, with tales of exploration and eerie encounters spreading like wildfire across forums and social media. What is it about this bizarre concept that has ignited the curiosity of so many internet denizens, including myself?

First and foremost, the backrooms tap into the primal human instinct for exploration. The idea of wandering through forgotten, decaying spaces, each room with its own unique atmosphere, beckons to the inner adventurer in all of us. The sense of the unknown, the anticipation of what might be around the next corner, fuels the excitement and adrenaline of the virtual explorer.

The sheer creativity and diversity within the backrooms contribute to their captivating nature. From desolate, flickering fluorescent lights to the unmistakable aroma of aged carpet, the vivid descriptions shared by fellow enthusiasts paint a vivid picture of an otherworldly environment. It's a world where reality blurs with fiction, and every room tells a story of its own.

What sets the backrooms apart is the community's commitment to storytelling and world-building. Through collaborative efforts, contributors weave intricate narratives that expand the lore of this digital universe. Each room becomes a chapter in an ever-growing anthology of the surreal, and the collective creativity gives rise to a sense of shared ownership among its participants.

The backrooms also serve as a canvas for artists and writers to showcase their talents. Striking visual representations, haunting poetry, and gripping short stories emerge, adding layers of depth to an already multifaceted landscape. The creative outpouring within the backrooms community transforms this internet phenomenon into a genuine form of artistic expression.

Moreover, the backrooms function as a space for introspection and self-discovery. The eerie ambiance and the sense of isolation within these virtual halls prompt contemplation on the nature of existence and reality. It's a digital pilgrimage that challenges one's perceptions and invites a deeper understanding of the self.

In my personal journey through the backrooms, I've found solace in the escapism it provides. The ability to immerse oneself in a world divorced from the constraints of reality offers a therapeutic retreat from the stresses of everyday life. It's a testament to the power of the human imagination, capable of constructing entire universes within the confines of a digital construct.

The backrooms, with their haunting aesthetic and rich narrative potential, also serve as a source of inspiration for other creative endeavors. Artists, writers, and even game developers draw upon the essence of the backrooms to craft their own interpretations, contributing to the ever-expanding legacy of this internet subculture.

In conclusion, the backrooms stand as a testament to the boundless creativity and collective spirit of the online community. As a virtual adventurer, I find myself enamored by the mystique and allure of this digital labyrinth. It's a journey into the unknown, a canvas for artistic expression, and a haven for those seeking an escape from the mundane. The backrooms, with their enigmatic charm, continue to captivate the hearts and minds of internet explorers, inviting them to lose themselves in the ever-expanding corridors of imagination. Overall 6/10.",1
27941,is fun but no ones playing it so yeah,1
27942,this game sucks ass,0
27943,"The good music plays when you are shooting the bad guys, and i am enjoying that.
Soundtrack is really fuckin good. I do wish the files had proper id3 tags, but maybe that's just a steam thing and the bandcamp version is fine.
Probably recommend buying on bandcamp instead if there's not a bundle sale going.",1
27944,"Incredible soundtrack, really really good and up there with the best. Stellar work, even on its own it's just a damn good album.",1
27945,"Dance to the beat,

27946,"Hard to imagine myself listening to this music other than while fraggin fools in a rave, or consuming illegal substances in a LAN party (or maybe the other way around?).
Excellent record by ""pat-own-back"" Revel, which I hear comes with a game included!
Glad to hear Drum&Bass in an OST, and glad to see people liking it so unanymously. This should be the soundtrack of Quake Champions, in fact, this has been my custom soundtrack of plenty of arena shooters.",1
27947,"Not quite sure if the game is to my tastes, but the soundtrack slaps.",1
27948,Comes with both MP3s and 16-bit 44.1kHz WAVs,1
27949,"I'd argue that this game is actually for everyone, despite what it may seem.
To enjoy it, you do need to understand how to ""play it"". It's not a game where you actually do a lot.

The first pitfall is that you can remove mushrooms by clicking them a lot, which isn't what you want to do for a really long time. I recommend to just let them grow and click each one maybe once to see if something funny happens. Also please take in the brief tutorial.

It's like a watch grass grow simulator, so at the start you just get to watch.
The thing that makes me say it can be enjoyed by everyone is that you can just have it running in the background when you do something more interactive and switch back to this game every now and then to check in on your mushrooms.

On its own this game is purely 2 things, a relaxation game and a cute collector game.
The atmosphere is very relaxing, just the noisescape is enough to make me have it on in the background.
Collecting cute mushrooms and trying to make them interact with each other is the fun part.
I do hope that the game gets more content, since I'm almost done collecting all of them.",1
27950,"this game sucks but the mushrooms are kawaii so im not gonna rate it down or refund it but tbh i wouldn't recommend it unless you wanna use it as a screensaver or something.

some suggestions:
have write ups/summaries/info about all of the mushrooms you can get
different colours for mushrooms
mushroom hats
put more depth into ""Each one has a unique personality."" If they could dance or emote at each other it would make it more rewarding to keep the game on longer and see what the mushrooms would get up to while AFK",1
27951,"this game is insanely cute and really relaxing. Honestly i love ""games"" like these so much. Only thing is idk if its just me but when i click out of the game in windowed mode the music stops playing. Other then that i totally recommend if you love games that you just throw on and watch as you let it do it's thing.",1
27952,"i have over 60 hours in the other big ""psychological horror watch things in an enviroment"" game, and i thought i would love this one too, however its just not really for me. i think as pretty as the game is, it just doesn't have enough going for it yet, they mushrooms are kind of just there and then not. it is definitely a life cycle of a mushroom thats for sure!

i think some nice additions would be adding names, little bios even about what makes them unique. as well having the music be playing even when tabbed out, maybe more and different songs. 

i personally didn't enjoy it, however someone else may, so i dont think a negative review is in order. if there is an update in the future with more to it maybe i'll give it a try again.",1
27953,"Its pretty amazing and addictive! there is a cop mushroom who put other mushrooms in jail, lol. Its very unique and relazing as well. Wish you could name them, otherwise highly recommend!",1

Woo! I just survived all 15 stages of the battlefield mode to obtain the final achievement needed to complete this game‚Ä¶and I have to say, Lizards Must Die is totally worth the money. There are story-based missions that you complete with your choice of four characters (unless you buy the dlc where there is one more added) and each one has their own unique weapon/move set. Then there is also a battlefield mode where you face waves of lizards and aliens! Movement and attacking can feel a little bit janky at times in crucial moments, but overall, it was a solid experience. It took me a couple deep runs in the battlefield mode for me to finally beat it but it felt awesome to finally complete. Playful and fun story combined with souls-like combat makes for a good time!

Achievement Count: 28
Time to 100%: ~2.5hrs
Difficulty: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

I've played this game twice already and both times I had a completely different experience. It's beautiful, and I will continue playing this game until the end of me. I bought a whole new gaming PC, two GTX 1080 TIs, an i9 7900X, 128 gigabytes of RAM, making sure I can play this wonder at 8k 144 FPS. I don't just recommend this game, I'm telling you to play it. If you don't, you are missing out on the reason humans exist. Every single person should play this game. I will fight wars to make sure people can continue playing this game. I have stayed in my room since this came out, which is the day I wrote this, and I haven't talked to anyone except the NPCs in this game. I think this is the next step in human evolution. We will eventually all be plugged into a machine, like in the movie, ""The Matrix"", where this beautiful masterpiece will be our life. Every day, we will wake up in heaven. Every night, we will go to sleep on the copy-pasted textures on the ground. That soon will be the glorious reality, the reality we are meant to be in.

Pretty fun game, absolute masterpiece of a soundtrack. Very funny to play in co-op. 

Maxing out is rather easy. ""Telega T34"" achievement may require you to use guide but it is still really easy. Only thing you may have problem with is the ""Impossible"" achievement where you need to play whole 15 waves of battlegrounds mode which isn't really easy because of the clunky movement but you can glitch it while playing with someone.

DLC is not required to max out.",1
27986,"A beautifully made game. And that's why:
- Graphics at the level of the latest projects from famous studios.
- A detailed plot based on archival documents and historical data about ancient Rus'.
- Amazing ambience, captivating you from the very first cutscene.
- Sophisticated combat system.

I recommend.",1

27999,"Game is not for me as I find the experience of playing this game to be a rancid affair--but there is charm here that I don't want to rob anyone going in with if they are looking for a brain rotting experience fighting lizards with friends. It is not however a hidden gem or a game of any quality beyond being a bizarrely successful meme game with nothing else going for it. 

It certainly does what it sets out to do for whatever that is worth, and for a storefront filled with asset flips this at least has carved an identity and weirdly large fanbase through the purity of its slav jank. I can't hate that. If I had friends to play this with I would probably appreciate it a bit more.

I don't recommend it to anyone who is looking for an actual functioning videogame with any amount of stakes.

I especially don't recommend this to anyone looking to play it with a controller--K/M controls are a bit more functional but the complete lack of impact from hits makes the whole lizard killing affair feel like I'm swinging around a wet paper towel. Also you can't rebind keys, at least from what I can tell. 

It is undeniably functional-ish and I am sure the ridiculous amount of positive reviews are in jest, but for me it fails to deliver a satisfyingly meaty monster mashing experience to recommend seriously. A modicum of effort to at least allow some keybinding could make this a bit less insufferable but even for a joke game it boggles the mind with how little effort was put into the game itself.

Not worth the dollar to anyone if they don't have friends willing to damage their brains by playing this with them.",0

28003,"I was partially excited about this because it was from the same think tank of the Dr. Livesey Rom & Death Edition game. Unfortunately this game doesn't quite accomplish the same charm. I will give credit where credit is due, I did myself laughing at the intentional ""so bad, it's good"" production and jokes, but I was also hoping for a nice little hack and slash game. You do get multiple levels, three playable characters, and several power moves to use. Achievements are easily attainable if you're into that. There's even aliens from outer space.

The game blasts Phonk like nobodies business, but it doesn't have the musical timing that Dr. Livesey had. It's core gameplay isn't that fun either. Reason being is that there's no weight or challenge to the combat. Dr. Livesey had gunplay that matched the feel of the music. I bring up Dr. Livesey because that's an example of a meme game done right. Lizards Must Die is like a bad piece of gum that loses it's flavor way too quickly.

Don't get me wrong, I wanted to love Lizards Must Die, and I'm not averted by some jank, but I just wasn't having fun, and games like this, at bare minimum, should be fun to play. I'm welcome to updating this review if updates fix the game.",0
28004,"Best baikal water simulator ever! This game is all I ever wished for. Finally I am able to slaughter lizards (and commit tax fraud). My life feels like massacre mode! Copyright overrated af anyways!! I'm a viking on steroids, next thing I know is I get caught by my parents playing with myself whilst slaughtering aliens on 360p. This game gives Isaac Newton cancer. How much do you even squat?! I think I will skip special ed-school tomorrow.",1
28005,"On June 17th, 2024, Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of Elden Ring stated the following:  ""I'm still in the process of making my ideal fantasy RPG. While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close."" This is the ideal game Miyazaki was referring to.",1
28006,"This is probably the best bad game I've played in quite some time.

It's absolute peak B-movie nonsense turned into a game, it's janky beyond believe, in some regards it's absolutely terrible but it's also incredibly fun to switch off and go along for the ride to kill all lizards for an hour or two.

I can't tell if this was designed to be ""so bad it's good"" on purpose or not and that just adds to the charm.

Sounds of the party / 10",1
28007,"The enemies have rng frames, Radislav is practically useless. The soundtrack contains non-Slavic music. There's no checkpoint system and cutscenes are rendered in game, meaning you miss out on i-frames if you skip them. If the fire breathing lizard manages to catch you, you're fucked.
This game fucking SUCKS.


Buy it.",1
28008,Its like trying play a normal game with 5 second lag factor to every action you make.,0
28009,Funny little russian meme game made slightly less funny from their govt's recent casual partaking in genocide and journalist killings. Unironically has one of the most fire soundtracks I've heard out of a game in years. Do not buy for the gameplay.,1
28010,"It's loud (but you can adjust the volume), janky, and the 'voice acting' and translations are a crime against humanity. The story is dismal, the strategy is rather non-existent, and it is bad...gloriously bad in the most entertaining way!

It's a small-team passion project, and their love of fun shines in this game (at least the English version...the Russian version may come off quite differently).

There are several maps (Lizard Men and, my favorite, Aliens) and settings, some minimal variation to available powers, and a very linear progression through the various encounters. The soundtrack is also really good!

For the price, and for the bad 80s movie vibe, I truly can suggest it as long as you understand what you're getting and getting into.

Also, for the achievement hunters out there: this one should be easy pickings with a few sessions; I'm at 55% after my first hour of game-play.",1
28011,"You should play lizards must die. It is this really cool souls like game that rivals games such as elden ring and dark souls in quality and lore. The voice acting is perfect, the emotion in the main character and villagers are like no other. The combat is smooth and satisfying as you slay your war through Lizards and their bosses. Like dark souls, the difficulty is hard but rewarding and gives a real sense of accomplishment. The game keeps itself fresh with the option for classes and different moves- from a ground pound that sends enemies staggering, a lightning strike from the sky to even chickens shooting eggs, this game has it all! If you‚Äôre a fan of dark soul games I highly recommend lizards must die.
",1
28012,"Despite controversial UNITY engine was used, game didn't exhibit no crashes or errors. 
As for playability, it took me few minutes to adapt the controls and camera POV, but since latest update, it is much better.
Lizards MUST Die is not a typical RPG, also not your everyday normal Action FPS (well, not shooter, more like axe swinger), it is something in between.

You can choose from different types (heroes), each having variety of unique skills / warcries / spells. 

Yet no matter what you chose, the game remains non-forgiving, if you can't embrace the controls, and be very nimble player. 

Cut scenes are mostly funny, and refreshing, but I hope there is a way to skip them (in case I start over) 

I like also the quite subtle message how Lizards / Lizardmen / bipedal snakes are ruthless aggressors and standing together and put a fight, is the key to victory. Everyone is full of ebil Putin narrative, but no one dares to criticize or even consider revealing lizard-like banksters, who control UK, US and also US and love starting global wars for no other reason than pure genocide and money.",1

28015,"An enjoyable Match 3 game which I am playing in Relaxed mode (there are 3 modes). There is a story to follow, with easy little puzzles to complete (like putting torn papers back together).

I don't know if they intended some of the animals an Nazis to humorous but I found them to be. The monkeys. LMAO. I found a little dog that follows me around and chases the monkeys up trees. 

It's also somewhat of a horror survival. Night time can be quite fun.

I think I enjoy it better than Elden Ring.",1
28024,"How is this less than $1?

The controls are fluid, the game-play has been glitch free, the graphics are decent enough, and the story is more than acceptable.

What surprises me is the content. This is a well thought-out game with plenty to do and a surprisingly large amount of content, maps, and villains. There is weapons crafting and upgrades, base-building, resource collection, and open world exploration. There are mutants, monsters, and Nazis to kill, and let's be honest; who doesn't love curb-stomping Nazi twatwaffles?

On a completely trivial note, it kind of reminds me (in a good way) of the 1977 Nazi-zombie film Shock Waves.

28031,"Super fun arena shooter roguelite. The artstyle is great. Upgrades you get during the run feel very impactful, making it fun to build up from the start and try different strategies. Later in the runs you'll be flying around with an array of movement abilities, swapping between multiple powerful weapons.

My only caveat is that the movement and gunplay doesn't feel quite as tight as some of the best arena shooters (at the time of this review), however it more than makes up for that for me by being a great roguelite which I haven't seen enough of in these types of games.

Along with the awesome in-run upgrades, there's both standard purchasable metaprogression and metaprogression through little quests that can be completed during the waves, which is neat and different. I look forward to playing more!",1

https://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/post/vampires-melody-2-translation-team-thoughts-and-thanks

I recently received a beta key of this game for free from MyLifeForOliveira as a translator and beta-tester for this game.

[i]AsicxArt[/i] has returned to Steam after a 3-year hiatus to release a sequel to its previous game with [i]Vampires' Melody 2[/i]. It continues the story of the vampire couple Raylan Monroe and Yella Lester following one of the endings in [i]Vampires' Melody[/i] in which they have been banished to a deserted island for failing a routine ID check. Raylan and Yella will have to learn to survive in a hostile new environment, and come to terms with the new reality after waking up from their slumber for 300 years.

As with [i]AsicxArt's[/i] earlier titles, [i]Vampires' Melody 2[/i] retains many of the charm and highlights from its earlier releases by featuring cute well drawn artwork and having great musical compositions for its accompanying background music. The art will look very nice on any visual novel fan's Steam profile. In addition, this title features fun, casual minigames that add some interactivity and make the player feel invested in the game and characters without being too difficult.

In terms of plot, [i]Vampires' Melody 2[/i] retains many of the cute, comical moments, and fan service as Raylan and Yella work together to survive in an island adventure with a comedy, fantasy, science fiction and mystery narrative. Some players may not like the fan service and romance tropes with a female vampire domineering over a cowardly male protagonist, although I still think the way the script is handled came off as very funny, and the scriptwriter has also given the protagonist several chances to save the day over a vastly more powerful supernatural being which saw me rooting for the protagonist despite his inherently weak and cowardly nature. Many of the scenes are also brought out very well by the excellent voice acting and artwork. They help to lend immersion into the game, bringing out the tense moments during minigame challenges. There are numerous references to events in the prequel, so it is recommended to finish the earlier game first before starting on this one.

Lastly, I would also like to share that I handled the English translation for this game.  As a long-time fan of [i]AsicxArt[/i], I was motivated to work on this project after following feedback from my friends in Steam, members of my Steam group (Visual novel, JRPG, Anime), and fans of [i]AsicxArt[/i] over a weakness in [i]AsicxArt[/i] and [i]SakuraGame's[/i] earlier games. The game's excellent production quality and feedback from fans of [i]AsicxArt[/i], together with support by [i]SakuraGame[/i] and my friends in Steam helped to build up the sense of pride and excitement to bring a cute and interesting comedy to an English audience. I hope the English translation for this game is an improvement over their earlier titles that will not disappoint fans' confidence in the games by [i]AsicxArt[/i], and would like to thank all the fans for their patience and support all this while.

Thank you to all my friends and family members who have supported me, and to [i]SakuraGame[/i] for giving me the wonderful opportunity to work on the English subtitles for the game before release. It was a pleasure to work on this project and we hope you will enjoy reading this cute, funny story, along with the cheery upbeat opening theme song [i]Seaside Melody[/i] by idol group [i]Luce Twinkle Wink‚òÜ[/i] to lighten your day.

28054,"Oh god, I liked the first game.

Unfortunately the dev has no Idea how to get this story going on a deserted island setting and made a Hatchet-like narrative going on, albeit poorly executed. Dev added in some flimsy minigames to mask the lack of plot happening but man is it still too much busywork to go through. I was 2 and a half hours in of hopefully getting into some kind of conflict did I then realize that I was already halfway through the game. Oh, well there was some mystery going on I guess which tried to grab my interest but it gets cancelled out since there is also some swoon-y and cringe romance tedium.

Funny they introduced some characters late game but at this point I wanted it to end. I guess this makes an ok lengthy fandisc but man is this not it for a sequel. Let alone being as much as the same length as the first game!",0
28055,"I really wanted to give this a positive review but it's kind of hard. I even waited until I played the whole game and went through every part of the flowchart and got all the achievements to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

In short, it's not really worth it. The story is mostly filler or over-extended, only the very beginning and the very end has any meaning at all, most of the things that happened in the middle could've been shortened, or made to be a whole lot more interesting. And by the end of the story[spoiler]they are placed in a situation very similar to the one they were in the previous game.[/spoiler]

Choices do not matter, this is a static visual novel through and through, there's only one choice that only change a few dialogues in two or three different places but has no bigger meaning to the story, it just serves to connect this game to the previous one. And the ""alternative endings"" are just ""you died"" screens from failing a few very specific mini-games. And speaking of..

The mini-games add nothing and, imo, only take away from the experience. They are way too easy, you cannot fail most of them (game just lets you repeat it until you do what it wants you to), and they are really really simple, they are more akin to quick time events than mini-games. In my opinion, if you're going to add mini-games, you should add actual mini-games and, other than maybe the very first time, don't force them onto the player. There's a few visual novels that did this well, having mini games about table tennis (ping-pong), pool, bowling, air hockey, card games, etc. Also having achievements related to failing those mini-games 3 times brings nothing but extra frustration to the player, even more so if you ignored achievements until you completed the game once, which just makes it worse because the fast forward/skip function in this game is really really slow.

The art style is, generally speaking, good, but I feel like they over-sexualized Yella for no good reason. Maybe I'm just misremembering but the previous game was nothing like that, and neither was any of their other games released so far. I bought and played pretty much every AsicxArt game because they were cute and heartwarming, with a (mostly) lightweight story.

All in all I don't like, and I feel like I just wasted my time playing this VN. It's not [i]bad[/i], but it's not good either. If you're planning on buying this I'd recommending waiting for a sale.",0
28056,"It's a letdown from the first one which was great. This one has a pretty bland story, very few choices, no real alternate routes. Way too many goats. The art is still good and music is decent. I wouldn't really say it's bad but it's not good either, when you consider how many better VNs there are to spend precious time on.",0
28057,"Just when you thought AsicxArt stopped making VN's, out of no where they come with Vampires' Melody 2!
Let me be honest, I'm very biased here, because I'm still waiting/hoping for Fluffy Store 2.
And I'll be honest to say that I think Vampires Melody 2 is not as good as the first one.

The story is so-so. You are stranded with Yella on an island, and you need to survive the elements and aggressive goats. While there are some funny moments, it wasn't very interesting. It started to get interesting with the caves and stuff, but it doesn't go very deep.
The biggest issue I had is with Yella's behavior. I mean, she was't very nice in the first game, but now she is outright abusive. Every time she doesn't like what Raylan says she kicks him, verbally abuses him and even threatens his life. And there is nothing Raylan can do, because his life was given to him by Yella and can be as easily taken away. A classic example of a toxic and asymmetrical relationship.
The ending was kind of good on its own -the story gains pace and I liked the drawings and bits of prose-, but when putting it in the bigger picture, it's very strange. Why does Yella suddenly become so mellow?? I wish she was like that in the whole novel. The pace is also so high that it feels rushed, and things don't make much sense anymore.

The only real reasons to buy Vampires' Melody 2 is the artwork, steam achievements, maybe the music. Also, you can switch between English, Japanese, and Chinese, which is nice for reading practice. Just don't expect too much from the story.

so, Fluffy Store 2, when??",1
28058,"The story was so bad. Just a life of keep catching goat, and on the way to catch goat. I lost my patient while playing the game. Also, the mini games are so stupid, I'm playing visual novel, doesn't need so much of interactions. Season 2 is really disappointing my expectation.",0
28059,"I did not expect such a strong start, let alone an outstanding story.
Easily a favorite.",1
28060,"The idea of a sequel to the first game is questionable, but the developers did it. Full story with fillers skipped:
[spoiler]The story takes place after two of the four endings in the first game. We end up on a deserted island, find some weird lab, maybe activate a superweapon that causes a tsunami. We get rescued, and move on to the true ending of the original game[/spoiler]
What the hell",0
28061,"To be honest, just don't buy it. The first was great, but this one is useless. They just had to don't publish it and stop the story with the first one, it was ok. 

The game doesn't add something about the first and the story is bad, they just add some mini-games to try to fix it.  

",0
28062,"Such a disappointment compared to the first game!! I got through the first few chapters before I decided I‚Äôd had enough. It‚Äôs just the two of them walking around the island alone. There‚Äôs way more talk of goats than there should be within only 2 chapters. Maybe it picks up, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit through multiple chapters for the chance to start caring about the game. There wasn‚Äôt even a plot‚Ä¶? It was truly just them wandering around looking for fish or goats. That‚Äôs not even worth me censoring for spoilers. Also, the dev decided to add in shitty mini games? If you can call them that. They‚Äôre just ‚Äúclick at the right time 3 times in a row!‚Äù with different scenarios. Super lame and unnecessary. 

I got this on sale for $1.99 and I still refunded it instead of taking the L and going achievement hunting just for something to do. Skip this one.",0
28063,"Plays out a bit slower compared to the first game. Humor is still there though. The story did lose me here and there as I tuned out and tuned in from time to time. Story heavy and has some interactive moments and a few fail endings later in the story. Save often post chapter 4. Really enjoyed art and interactive moments, but the story just lost me too much. Still a good read, especially if you enjoyed teh first.",1
28064,"It's shorter than the last game and has less choices, there's also no punishments for failing minigames but is still a great novel.",1

28066,"my acquaintance with asicxart games began with the first part of the vampires` melody. i immediately fell in love with this game and hyperfixated on it lol. but anyway, the story is heartwarming, and despite the low budget, the game turned out to be rather lovely. 
then I played the second part. minigames are a great way of interactivity that kind of replaces choice-making, because there is simply no choice-making, which is very depressing. speaking of plot, i can say it is rather shallow comparing to the first part, BUT nevertheless, it still made a tear whirl down my face. i guess my hyperfixation + the trait of perceiving certain game characters as the family members had their hand in my adoration of this game ^^
i bought the game full price because i am very eager to support the developers. i hope they will release something soon... please...its not like im begging you but---
oh, and if you are still reading, you should definitely try this and many other games. fox hime and fluffy store are very enjoyable.",1

28072,"I enjoyed this VN, not as much as the first but I do find it worth playing if you really liked the first one.",1
28073,"I don't know how you can mess up the sequel this badly. Half the story is about catching goats, another big fraction is about day-to day-chores, only the end gets somewhat interesting (probably to hype you up for the third part). 

I appreciate the devs went out of their way and tried experimenting with the mini-games to keep you engaged, as reading this story will make you fall asleep in no time. The problem is, the mini-games kinda suck.

I can't recommended the game to anyone, those who liked the first part will find it rather disappointing, and the ones who haven't played the first part should play it instead and forget this game exists. Better have an open ending than giving this crap a try.",0

28087,"I'll be giving this game a thumbs up for now, however, It is really awesome, in my first 15 minutes, But things that I'd want in future updates to improve the game are:
- Have the ability to parry with the knife while reloading (currently you can't do that)
- Sounds option (Currently the game doesn't have any options to configure the music volume etc)
- Overhaul the UI (The Game's UI isn't the best)
- When dialogue is being played have the option to click to continue to the next dialogue text (It moves to fast)
- The voices in the game is to low and hard to understand
- And lastly It would be cool for you to add some skin to the character = ) and it'd be visible in First person aswell, for example (Red sleeves, and gloves that have lightning emitting from them) something unique

Overall, I'm going to continue to play this game more, hope it is still worked on in future updates and above in which I recommended gets added

EDIT Day 1: (I'll be adding onto this edit more things that should be updated the longer I play)
 - Also what would be good in the future is to add Skins to the Knife Aswell/Abilities
 - Photo Mode
 - Being able to aim when running around
 - Instead of making the knife auto-block, Make it so that the player when they right click, can activate the block mode on and off.
- (Not sure if this was intentional, but I noticed, you die in one hit?)
- Should have the ability to move faster when holding the knife out

Edit Day 2: Jesus Christ...this game is UNFORGIVING LOL... IF YOU don't like dying alot, and you rage quit, this won't be your game, it is hard, you die in 1 hit, and to the level I had to take a break on, they just threw multiple huge aliens at me all at once...lord have mercy, but more things that should be added

- Make the player able to block while reloading aswell (please lord)
- Make every level a checkpoint OR remove the dialogue if a player has already seen it once and dies Or a skip button, I can't lie, not to be mean, it's annoying and stressful to have to wait every single death and every single time for the dialogue/cutscene to finish for the 1000th time
- (A cool Suggestion that would change the flow of combat) Only if y'want, make it so that if a player successfully hops ontop of an alien, it damages the alien or kills them, that would be cool, but would need to make the player jump higher.",1
28088,"Let me preface this its a fun game but you should wait a while as there's a decent amount of platforming bug issues and a semi rough translation and some rune balancing. 

That said once they fix those major issues, I would definitely recommend it, so be patient and allow them to fix the bugs before buying. Once they fix these issues its a gonna be a major gem.",1
28089,"While I had some trouble running it consistently when I first started playing, I've since had very little issues the last few times I've booted it up. The combat is satisfying, the movement upgrades make sense and are very useful and the story is mysterious and interesting. I haven't finished this game yet, but if you're a fan of metroidvanias, give this one a try; try the demo first if you're unsure, but I'm still enjoying it 9 hours in and the gameplay is very familiar to hollow knight in some ways, such as spike pogoing, a wonderful charm system and platforming challenges for rewards and upgrades. Do yourself a favor, just jump right in and get ready for a wild ride; you'll be glad you did.",1

This isn't as much as much a review as it's more about the Steam Deck.

When I first downloaded the game it would crash every time on the oled steam deck.  If you run into this issue change the compatibility settings to run on Proton 8.5.

When you first set the setting to 8.5, if you haven't installed it before it will automagically d/l the needed files for this.

At first you will see a black screen, but let it stay up and eventually you will see the Unity logo.

28093,Nice little line puzzle game.,1
28094,"Great game for what is there and asking price!
If you liked insexsity check out this game, can't wait to see it keep growing
you start off by creating a character pick some traits positive and negative traits or none at all, blood type ""effects your character in some positive ways"" and a back round ""also effects in different stats"" then your dropped in a world where you can make choices on how you'd like it to turn out, depending on stats and traits different random events can trigger.
there is an energy system that you use when ever you go to a new location interact with object around the world, work, or sexual acts. Your energy drains differently depending on the actions you do. can gain back energy through food, sleep, energy drinks.
Your character has a hygiene meter too, that drains depending on your actions and can be gained back through items or taking a shower.
there's a lot of areas accessible from your home, diner, slums, red-light district, park, alley, clothing store and etc, lots of ground to be covered and discovered.
Just give it a try it's literally a dollar and has lots of content for it.

Edit: I really liked this game, but after being in the discord the dev of this game was always polite and quick to response but essentially he said that he was abandoning the game in a month or 2, because it didn't do so good on steam, and essentially it was to advert his game for other sites, I should've known better cause whenever a game is released on here and there's other sites involved ""the subscription based ones"" they usually ditch the game on here and do bare minimum. super disappointing and the one time i let my guard down thinking hey this person cares about the game and not the money ""as they've also stated in the discord"" but seeing him say he's abandoning it in a month or two contradicts that statement and is just like every other dev that uses steam as an advert, yeah its a dollar but for this reason I would avoid this game.

The dev banned me from the community discussion, cause I called him out on the points of my review, also he has stated in the discussion that the Patreon version is an update ahead which i thought was against steam rules but what do i know since ""i'm an attention seeking troll"" for telling people that he was thinking of ditching the game, saying it was an advertisement for his patreon and stating we missing content and behind content of patreon. that was the reason for him banning me while name calling me, crazy even though it's all true and all what he has said. DEV is also banning anyone else who has brought up any of the fine points of my review in the discussion tab and giving rude ban messages, thinking its me with alt accounts. Iv'e said what I had to say not my problem others have seen your discord of you saying your ditching the game and laughing about it.",0
28095,"""Mr. Unaware ‚Äî 08/02/2024 9:43 AM
Well, Insexsity together with Fleeting Iris were my main inspirations for the project, but none of these games went for Steam in their prime, but more like a way squeeze a bit more $$$ in their last days. This game will stop getting updates some time this year, because all my current effort goes into its remaster - Unaware in The City: Revisited. Steam is more of an experiment to me rather a way to earn more, and hopefully nobody will feel cheated that they had to pay $1 for a game that will stop receiving updates in a few months. Sure, I could charge $10-20 and make much more from Steam, but it would leave a very bad aftertaste in my mouth üòõ Either way, enjoy!""                                                                                                                This is a direct quote from the developer in his general chat with time stamp for proof. Not saying anything that hasn't been said by yourself.(Also I  have a screen shot of proof) Why not set this game up for success from the start and release the same updates at the same time? Not making us go outside from steam for more of the content. Truly not very demure of you . Can't take this one down buddy. I'm a long time standing member of steam not a troll like you want to believe. Don't talk down to people for speaking the truth about statements you, yourself have made. 

The negative reviews tell the truth in the discord and there's proof in the pudding :P",0

28097,"Despite the very simple graphics, the game is very entertaining and funny and you can play your character in many different ways. For this price, it is really a bargain.",1
28098,"As someone who's been into PC gaming since 1998, I've played a huge number of games and I have a lot to compare it to. 

Apart from the science fiction and space genres, a separate item of my hobby is NSFW adult games. 
Not just as dumb porn, but as a separate genre of games that subtly plays on human passions and instincts. My point is that this project actually deserves a lot of attention. It's a great adult game that is quite competently designed. 

It has many features, well chosen and put together, which create a fascinating and interesting life simulator in its cute 2d style. 

There are many ideas that would be good to implement in this game. Right now, it's not a cut diamond. But if the developers continue to support the project - this game can go to the top list of games of similar genre. Recommended for purchase. I believe that after the release and the end of development the game should be worth more. The work of the developers is worthy of praise and support. Well done guys.

28101,"This is an adult life sim sandbox style game with both rpg and lewd scavenger hunter mechanics with a female protaganist ... that's a mouthful!

But its so good . . .

It is currently sold for $0.99, so as long as you are in the market for an adult game with a female prot, its more than worth checking out. Overall, I was fairly impressed with the game, and it shows promise to be even better as it is further developed. Most of what you'd want in an adult, female prot life sim etc etc sort of game are checked off, and I think my only complaint was that there really wasn't enough places for the prot to work or go or have fun and some of the events became a little stale after a while ... but for $0.99, and with potential to get a lot better, its very worth it. The prot is customizable both in appearance, background, and even voice a little, the rpg mechanics are pretty sound, there is a mini dress up game, adult fetish hunters will likely be fairly pleased with various scenes in the game, and I can think of more good things ... but the prot is currently stuck working at one job where she really has no chance to not end up corrupted at some point, I think, and there is no bar, no night club, no spa, etc. etc....so lots to be added, but I have confidance that the creator will add more of those things in - so yes, I'd gladly recommend this game for those looking for an adult female prot game.",1

28111,"Another worthwhile addition, the new weapon is good & the bow now takes a sight, but the main feature is the caller.

While some say its too heavy, I don't find it a problem myself because I will just carry a tent with me, deploy that & then use the stash inside the tent to equip the caller, walk out to a spot, place the caller then go back to the tent & equip as many weapons as I like.

Not a problem, its part of the management of the loadout.

Somebody pointed out that it gives you a headache, I AGREE!! my first use I thought ""NO WAY, this is annoying"" but have a look in the sounds menu, they have conveniently added a slider to adjust or turn off the remote caller sounds.

I can see this being useful as I can call animals to a location while I sit in a treestand, there are lots of options, some say its cheating but I think they use bait IRL don't they? 

The only thing I do agree with others are the cosmetic packs, they should have been free for each reserve as we have already purchased the reserve, but at the end of the day these are all DLCs, they are not compulsory.",1
28112,"I think my Refund Request notes say it best!

*******

I bought this pack purely for the electronic caller:

1. Wa-ay too heavy, ridiculous! Should be 2-3 kg MAX!
2. Calling is constant and therefore unrealistic and highly irritating - this could be overcome with a 'frequency' setting and/or even a 'manual fire' button. Currently, it is a very 'blunt instrument'. Frequency should have a broad range of at least 10-60 seconds between calls.

I love the concept and I'm looking forward to new and interesting ways to hunt, but I cannot use this in it's current state. If you bring the weight down AT LEAST 1-2 kilograms and introduce a broad frequency setting, I will repurchase immediately.",0
28113,"The e-caller can be turned down in Audio settings! All these negative reviews about the noise... just turn it down!
The e-caller has a range of 200m. It is OP for canada geese farming. I occasionally call with my reed caller as well because it has a range of 500m. They work together.
The rifle is cool, love lever acitons.",1
28114,"The e-caller works well.
Remember that you can turn the volume down in settings. It doesn't change its effectiveness, just ensures you don't go mad listening to it.
It's kinda heavy at 5kg but can make life a lot more simple on reserves with lots of animals. It also takes the hassle out of switching to an individual caller every 5 seconds.
Not sure about the weapons, haven't used them, but the caller is well worth the money.",1
28115,"Dissapointed in the electronic caller. On Emerald coast there's no caller for kangaroos, Banteng, or Saltwater Crocodiles. The three big species that are argaubly the most fun to hunt. Yet the caller works on Alligators on other maps. After a long wait for the DLC that was a huge let down",0
28116,"False advertising - says all callable species can be lured with the electronic caller, but tigers cannot be called in with it. Tigers have a caller in the game, why does this device not work with them?",0
28117,"The electric caller is rather.. interesting to say the least
Instead of selecting one setting and calling one animal at a time, Yeah it calls every animal in the game no matter what setting, you guys really put 0 effort into this and its a disappointment, only really good thing about it is the gun.
That's all I have to say.",0
28118,"The rifle is really nice, it's good for class 4-8 and has a nice fire rate and reloads fast. Great choice for an all-rounder.

The electronic caller seems really good - you can select the call for almost every animal in the reserve you're on - but it's heavy and it's made for ambush hunting which isn't really my thing, I like to keep moving and use the standard callers. 
The really important thing about it is that it's remote - you can enable/disable it and change the call type from a distance which means you can lure animals into view from your stand or wherever to get a clear shot without risk of them seeing, hearing or smelling you while getting into position.

I haven't used the bow and probably won't so I don't know if that's any good.

Besides the rifle it's not much value for a player like me but if you really enjoy ambush hunting, it's probably worth it for the electronic caller.",1
28119,"The Ambusher Pack is fantastic! I love the Moradi Model 1894 .44 lever action rifle. The exceptional penetration (or expansion if you use the hollow points) really makes it an excellent choice for medium-sized animals, especially within 150m, though you can certainly take down larger ones, even out to 300m.

When paired with the outstanding electronic caller, you can easily set up a tree stand, blind, or tripod to position the animals where you want them. What's particularly noteworthy is that the electronic caller attracts both American alligators and raccoon dogs, for which standalone callers aren't available (although there's a Perk that works on raccoon dogs). (In response to bad reviews complaining that the caller is unrealistically 5 units of weight: like the high weight of the digital rangefinder bow sight, the caller's weight is more about game balance/limitations to prevent making stand-alone callers obsolete [try carrying all the waterfowl callers; they also have unrealistic weights].)

I'm also quite fond of the Stenberg Takedown Recurve Bow. It's lightweight, compatible with standard arrows, and, most importantly, can utilize all the available bow sights in the game. Due to its light weight and versatility, it's worth carrying as an alternative weapon, even if you're not primarily a bowhunter.

All things considered, this is one of the finest weapon and equipment packs released. I'm thoroughly enjoying it, and it's unquestionably worth the price, especially for the electronic caller.",1
28120,"Worth it for the electronic call. Remember that you can turn down the caller volume in the settings menu. As someone that has spent a lot of time IRL hunting coyotes behind an electronic call-- I appreciate this slider more than you can imagine. It doesn't affect the in-game volume, only the system setting for your speakers. Priceless. 
The .bow is fine but there isn't much variation in the traditional bows to begin with. I was more excited for the .44 Mag lever gun and it is solidly....okay. I frankly think it's rated too high in the game as the .44 mag in a carbine length barrel produces roughly half the numbers of a .45-70 Gov't cartridge. With a .45-70 in the game, there should be more to differentiate the two from one another. 
As a fan of lever guns though, it rounds out the collection until we get a .22LR lever gun like a Henry Rifle.",1
28121,"Bought it for because every item is made for me. I almost exclusively use lever action and bows and I am an ambusher style hunter.

Every single item is a minor let down in some way.

Rifle (Pass) I like have access to modern scopes on a lever action so the rifle is a pass. Though it is annoying to have to hit reload every round at the rifle range.

The Caller(FAIL) weighs a lot, which is fine I guess if it was more powerful. But it is constantly spraying out calls and gets annoying quick. So if you are looking for a hunt on the move(I am not talking long stalks, I mean moving with wind or circling a lake.) item at all it is not handy and weighs so much you cant afford to bring extra callers. Having to go back and pick it up every time I want to move a little was more of a hindrance than I thought it would be.

The Bow(FAIL) I was so excited for the bow. Can accept all modern sights which is fun. But it is just wildly inaccurate and not even consistently inaccurate. It pulls to the right super hard for me to the point where even using the high tech scope It would shoot out of circle at the 50m targets. It was so bad I thought it was a weird bug where the arrows were just not being registered.",0
28122,"The electronic caller is a really good idea for this game, but the frequency is so high and it stops calling by it self relatively fast, not sure if that is intended or bug, but its annoying. It is a great tool though, combine it with the scent sprays and you have a really effective trap. I don't care much for the new lever-action rifle but the recurve bow is really cool and was needed, we had no ""traditional style"" bow in the game of this quality, but now we do.",1
28123,"5kg for the caller is waayyyy too heavy. 

This thing has the same weight as ten (!) normal callers, and I never take ten callers with me. This alone renders it useless, unless 
(i) I don't take any firearm for birds/rabbits/foxes etc, or 
(ii) I take a backpack for all the the extra weight. 

Another thing they don't tell you, is that even though it weighs as much as ten normal callers, its attraction strength is on average 25% less than other callers. 

This is a massive disappointment.",0
28124,"The electronic caller is the best damn thing to ever be added to this game.
It doesn't take that much space (I don't know wtf some people are crying about)

You can ambush animals in any way possible with this, it's like being with another hunter but solo, it's much more fun to hunt with this.",1
28125,"Hard to tell if it's working, All I hear is loud calls every 2 seconds, no clue what the animals are actually doing...(aka useless). I also found animals will not go to it out in the open, they go like, around somewhere which is usually like 150 meters from the ""caller""(noise box). AKA they act scared of it and hide where you can't shoot. Eh, working as intended?",0
28126,"The .44 magnum lever-action rifle is one of the most goated and busted firearms at the moment. It's a class 3-8 rifle which makes it a rifle that never leaves my backpack, but does suffer from pulling off longer range shots (300m+). It can easily double lung and, drop animals in literal seconds which is absolutely awesome. The electronic caller kind of sucks, but its worth it for making story missions easier. The take-down recurve is a solid choice for a 2lb weight category and thankfully does accept the EZ mode sight for quiet eliminations. I would highly recommend this DLC specifically just for the .44 mag rifle, but the other two items are kind off worthless in my opinion.",1
28127,"I really like this DLC except for the rifle, it looks nice and has cool animations but I haven't found a fitting place for it in my loadouts. The bow is a nice addition though. Like others have said it feels a bit inaccurate but thanks to its low weight I've been able to ""squeeze"" it in most of my loadouts so I always have a bow with me which is a trade off I don't mind.

The caller is very heavy but I think that most people are missing the point. The way I see it is you're supposed to put it down and camp out in a hunting stand or whatever. HOWEVER.... it still weighs the same after putting it down so the remote takes up 1/4th of your inventory (unless you've got a backpack on) I'd like it more if the weight gets reduced after putting the caller down.

I'm having a lot of fun with it and hey this pack only costs 5 eur so can't complain really.
",1
28128,"Now I will tell you why this supplement is not worth its money. 
When the electronic decoy was announced I thought that the developers finally decided to make a variety in the game and give the opportunity to fans of hunting from ambush to hunt exactly from ambush and not just walk around the reserve and shoot animals. But as soon as I bought and tried this decoy I was very disappointed. 
1. I decided to try the ambush hunting. I bought tents and went to set them up in the preserve.
2. After that I decided just without marked zones of needs to start beckoning, first some animals and then others, sat and waited suddenly some animals are near.
3. One call, another call and so passed all the beckoning sounds and unfortunately no one came. And this means that the animals still need to walk and look for unfortunately and DLC did not justify their expectations from the manc as the weapon is not bad to say.
The developers did not try and did not make a variety in the game and the possibility of such was. They think that everyone likes only this kind of hunting, and they apparently don't care about those people who like hunting in a cage. Why not make and for such people the opportunity to hunt as they want? Why not make stuffed animals not only for birds, but also for deer, for example, not to give the opportunity to arrange ambush positions and so bait and whoever comes will be the trophy. Not everyone likes only the Greats to extract or diamonds. I, for example, on the contrary interesting just the variety and not shooting as in shooters. 
Now specifically the disadvantages of mank and DLC in general:
1. The decoy has a large weight - 5KG
2. The decoy has the lowest ability to lure compared to conventional decoys, namely - 30 vs. 40 or more. (could add new sounds for baiting and make better baiting just for ambush hunting).
3. manok manik as well as the usual one for 200 meters, it is not enough and could make the zone more for ambush hunting as it is not convenient to carry such a box with you and I do not know who will do such a thing.
4. it is inferior to the usual decoys in all characteristics.
Now I will tell you what this electronic decoy can be useful for:
1. For tasks where in a certain area you need to get an animal. 
2. For hunting birds. 
More I do not see the point of carrying in the bag this almost useless thing and developers with us just mock us with this approach in the development of content for the game. This decoy to buy is the same as buying a car that does not go, there is no use for it and I think I spent money in the wind and do not advise anyone to buy this DLC unless you do not need a new weapon. Weapons are not bad in the package. 
I'm a fan of the game, I buy all DLC that come out and even all the coloring although it became twice as expensive as it was, but more I will not buy something like this, there is nothing to feed those who do not try and release some nonsense just to rip off the players money. They even on broadcasts do not try to make a normal presentation of their new DLC, it is bluntly obvious that the game for them is more only earnings and not creativity and desire to add something new to the game. I think the developers need to respond in the same way, do not buy and let them think about the future.

28129,I have absolutely no idea how this isnt installed like any other dlc i have purchased i cant find in the game store where to purchase the electronic lure and i also do not see any of the guns i purchased in my game?!,0
28130,"I wish these reviews had a neutral recommendation instead of yes or no.
The best part about this is the lever action and the recurve. 
The e-caller, however, says it is compatible with all species in its description but you can't call every species. I was looking forward to calling in some grouse in revontuli :(",0
28131,"A worthwhile addition to the game! The .44 is great, and the bow takes a sight, but I will agree with everyone else that the caller is a bit heavy! I don't mind, though. I just manage via tents.",1
28132,"nice new DLC. the new caller comes very handy ‚Äî place it in front of your favorite hunting stand, let it run and wait for the animal. the advantage here is you dont call it to your location than to a perfect spot to shoot at and you dont have to call all the time cause the device does it for you. like the new approach as an addition to the ‚Äûtraditionell‚Äú hunting methods.

oh, and the price is top ‚Äî you get also a powerful lever action and a nice recurve bow.",1
28133,"The obviously contentious part of this pack is the electronic caller, so I'll talk about that last.

The recurve bow is highly effective. It has a low draw weight but is still more than capable of skewering multiple organs, especially with the Pumping Iron perk. It's really low in terms of mass, like the traditional bows, but allows for sights, which makes it infinitely more accessible.
The 1894 is an excellent addition, too. Having a rifle capable of 3 - 8 Class harvests means it's capable of replacing one of the very common 4 - 8 Class rifles in a loadout. The default ""zero"" for the 1894 is definitely further than the .44 Magnum revolver with the handgun optic, but it is not the ""standard"" range seen with nearly every other rifle cartridge. The 1894 is also relatively low mass for a rifle and I do like its animations.

Electronic caller is highly useful, but it is annoying.
Actual electronic callers can facilitate delays between calls but theHunter's version absolutely doesn't. It's fun to hear some new calls and have selections between the different types of calls for a species.
It is also quite heavy. 5 units is big and means your loadout will have to change to facilitate it, and I'm pretty sure that it's heavier than just having every caller for a reserve on your person.
Bumping down the weight by a unit and allowing intermittent or timed calls would make this useful tool less of a burden.

Not a bad pack! No doubt worth it if you're waiting on theHunter sales.
",1
28134,"I've added the game to my cart, bought it, downloaded it, and although it's supposedly in my library, I cannot find the caller or the rifle, or the bow anywhere in the store.  So I don't know what to tell you other than a) I'm disappointed with my experience, and b) proceed with caution when deciding to purchase this DLC.

28136,"The gun is great for close engagements huge pen, e caller works well with blinds, tree stands and tripods or just hiding in a bush, remote switching is great when you see a different animal approach and switch to its call, duck hunting works really well too and the bow is very light to be compensate for the weight of the caller and works almost as well as the bear claw",1
28137,"The caller is great for duck hunting and when hunting in maps with many species like NEM or Rev. It would be nice, if we are able to recall it from the inventory.

The Rifle and bow are ok, but I think the caller is the only selling point for this DLC.",1
28138,"Updating review to recommended since EW changed the e-caller stats. Now it weighs 3.5 and the attraction strength was updated to match the other callers. Also, I've tested it a lot ingame now. I can say it is at least as effective as the manual callers, likely better as it spaces the calls automatically. Well deserved thumbs up now.

Original review below.
______________________________________________________________
I'm not fond of bow hunting, so I have not much of an opinion, just test it a little at Parque's range, it can use the digital scope, that's very good, but even with that scope I never landed a single shot on the 100m target.

The Moradi, yeah, it drops small deer on the spot. A little scary to use against Moose, because they run like crazy, even when double lunged. This is, quite frankly, nearly a meme rifle - you can drop Mule deer with shots thru the backside and the ridiculous penetration will cause you to get stomach, liver, and lung. Now, nothing really bad about this. It is worst for example in ""Classic"", where you have the 9.3 O/U, or the .340, that will allow you to do the same but with a water buffalo, and also drop it on the spot. Mules will run a little bit at least with the Moradi.

Finally, the main ""attraction"", the e-caller. So far I'm getting mixed results with this caller. I used it for geese; it doesn't seem to have any advantage over decoys, it was, predictably, worse. I thought of combining it with decoys, and didn't see any advantage either. And what would be the point? This caller actually works more like a decoy in the sense that you set it up and hide preparing to shot from a distance. Then it seems to work much better with coyotes, but just barely with red deer. At this point I don't know if I'll be using it at all, as it has too many disadvantages.
This is the reason I'm saying no ""at this time"", with the hope that the devs will actually do something about it. I understand the need to ""balance"" a device like this. However, and I've seen this same feedback in several places, it is too much. They made it weigh 5 units, that is the equivalent to 10 callers, that you'll never ever will want to carry, you wouldn't need to carry that many. This would be okay, however, the problem is that they also are only giving it an effective calling range of 200 meters, and worst, they gave it an attraction strength of only 30 compared to the 40 most manual callers have. This absolutely doesn't make sense, it is an electronic/digital caller. It should have the best optimization to give you a way better attraction than a regular caller.",1
28139,"Bought it, it's in my library and  It's not available when I go into the storage in-game, none of it. How do you solve this?

It has been resolved, as of today 25 October.
If you have problems with this, delete your mods in dropzone folder, et voil√° !

The mods that are affecting this DLC are: 
Soft feet = won't load your ambusher pack items.
Run speed = Your bow and the caller are there but won't be working.

Increase render distance WON'T affect this DLC and neither increasing speed of your atv.
I haven't tested the other mods. 

Happy hunting !",1
28140,"When you realize how powerful the handguns are and decide to put the same ammo in a rifle you get a monster of a gun. E-caller is awesome for not having to carry 6 different callers at once and worrying about what calls you need every time you join a map. The bow and rifle are very awesome, haven't tried the new bow yet but it's light and you can put all the sights the compound bows use on it (including rangefinder bow sight).",1
28141,"Bought it for the caller which is almost a cheat item.
Every call in the game at will without the need to level to it or to carry the caller itself.
Can attract the animal to a position of your choosing and your hands are free to shoot it since the caller bleets on its own.
Never fails to attract the animal, but i have skills put into callers.
Bit heavy at 5kg, but i can still carry 1x tent, 1x bow, 1x rifle, 1x handgun, spraycans of Stink B' Gone, dogfood and ammo with a tiny backpack so i don't see the issue.

28143,"Update: after this update I have suddenly started crashing every time I play. Seems to be a progressive bug that gets worse with time.

.44 is worth it I like ti a lot. I do agree with others. it makes no sense that the caller weighs more than most rifles. I think it could be lowered to 3 max.

Edit: after playing with the .44 a little there seems to be an issue where the animals can jump the first shot. Its almost like the first shot completely misses then the follow up can hit. I have tested it multiple times now and the gun itself seems to be missing for no reason.",0
28144,"Great dlc makes it so much more easy to hunt from a treestand and tower or hide out.

28153,"--EDITED after testing out Moradi--

Giving a thumbs up, but with reservations.

The electronic caller is, as others have said, extremely annoying. The high frequency of calls per minute is grating at best, and completely unbearable at worst. It works though, and can allow for changes in tactics which is a welcome thing at this point in the game.

I also like the bow. It's only 2 lbs, and can use all bow sights, including the electronic range finder sight. This is quite nice because it allows for some interesting loadouts. The bow works fine, though it does feel like the lower poundage actually has an in-game effect, notably when attempting frontal heart shots. So while it's not a mandatory addition to the game, it is a nice one, and probably my new favorite bow. That being said I AM an avid archer in RL, so any new bow is fun for me. YMMV.

I could care less about yet another rifle however, and have not even tried this new one. I'm sure it's fine, but whatever really, this game is not hurting in the rifle department. Overall, this seems like a wasted opportunity to me. You could argue that the new recurve also does not add anything new I suppose, but to me it does stand out as a more unique weapon, given that we didn't have a 'normal' take-down recurve that can mount sights (and that lower weight does come into play compared to the compounds). A rifle that can use .44 cartridges may be fun for some (and all the power to you), but I don't think this really translates into new gameplay or strategies. So great, you can use a heavier weapon with a calibre already available in a lighter weapon... IF the ballistics for the 44 projectile actually change in the 44, then I could see the point, but unless I'm mistaken, EW has not done anything like that so far (EDIT: I was wrong there, the .44 ballistics are slightly improved in the rifle, see below for my results). The Cuomo shoots EXACTLY like the 243 rifle (I've checked that out at the range, there is no difference) even though the barrel is quite short (obviously). In the case of the Cuomo however, this is an AMAZING thing, because you can carry that light pistol around to shoot any class 2 to 6, which gives a lot of freedom in loadouts...

Overall, this pack is nowhere near as interesting or necessary as some of the other packs, and the electronic caller is really a mixed-bag. I don't think I'll be using that thing myself; it's too heavy but mostly, it's just WAY too annoying. As for the weapons, I think in the end it just comes down to personal preference. But neither the bow or the rifle are really necessary upgrades, IMO.

But I am still recommending the DLC, if only because I approve of anything that can (at least theoretically) lead to new tactics and/or strategies, even if the execution is not perfect. Put another way, I'm ok with giving EW some of my money now for this sub-optimal selection, in the hopes that they put weapon packs out more frequently (which ideally means more chances of us getting really neat/different/exciting/game-changing items).

Moradi/Panther comparison
No zeroing perk
.44 is good for classes 3-8

Moradi (3 lbs) with Hyperion scope
----------------------------------
100m => shots land on cross-hair
150m => shooting at 10 ring, most shots land low on 8/9 line.
200m => shooting at 10 ring, most shots land low on 4/5 line. 

Panther with pistol scope
-------------------------
50m => shots land on cross hair
100m => shooting at 10 ring, most shots land low on 7/8 line.
150m => shooting at 10 ring, most shots land low on 2/3/4 line.

With these results, I can see a place for the Moradi in loadouts, given the in-game versatility of the .44 cartridge. Also, the rifle is pretty darn light at only 3 lbs, so it is in fact quite nice, stats-wise...",1
28154,"10-23-23 Review update;

Since my original review I have figured out what was keeping the dlc from working.  I removed an old mod that was no longer working after the last update and the the Ambusher Pack content was then available in the game.  So if it is not showing up in your game, that is something you might want to look into.

Now that it is working, I have to say that I like the new content very much.  The new gun which shoots .44s, is very handy because that caliber covers a lot of class range 3-8.  I also like the electronic caller, it is fun to use.  I haven't tried the bow as I'm more a gun enthusiast and not really into bow hunting.  

---Original review---
Items are not showing up in the game.  Very disappointing because was looking forward to some new toys to play with.  I've tried verifying the game files and disabling and re-enabling the DLC.  Neither has worked.  The price didn't break the bank or anything so I'll hang onto it in hopes they fix this.  Looking at the reviews, it's clear I'm not the only one with the issue.  If the issue is fixed, I will update my review.",1
28155,I really like the takedown bow. The e game call is awesome and you can call animals in from so far away.,1
28156,"BUG. After I placed the caller on the ground as instructed and right clicked to select the sound, the device's GUI just disappeared.",0
28157,"Okay to clarify something people are complaining about the caller is honest useful but it does require having knowledge of the hunting zones and what you are hunting i can easily work in open spaces but is good if you're in a tree to help with visibility. it is also good for attracting animals from area's that is is often hard to spot them in like coyote's and other small game as long as you're patient.

moradi exce[let rifle for hunting dear/medium fame decent raye of fire fo lung and headshots but does have a maximum range of about 150meters for effective use 200 if you know how to use the gun effectively(only done that once or twice myself) while the bow light weight shorter range than mos bots but less weight making hunting easier  though i often will use tracers with it when i can to help with tracking if i'm having trouble getting that kill shot",1
28158,It is a usual broken. When you sneak and want to change call you see nothing. And the caller weight as 10 callers!?! In the end it is a rifle and a bow for 5‚Ç¨ and both is not worth the price at all. Wait at least until the lazy devs fix the bug! That way they have an extra motivation ;),0

If you fall, (which is all I did, considering the weird, slippery movement) you don't get re-spawned, but instead have to do MORE slippery platforming just to get back up to where you fell.

28173,"I've played video games for the past 40 years. This game is a throwback game with above average difficulty featuring a variety of themes on each level along with the entertaining original music. The variety offered by this game is refreshing change to most games these days. 

The game appears to be basic from the marketing but it's anything but another attempt by game developers to bait you into another ""basic"" and ""mindless"" trap to make the happy buck. This is a genuine classic development of a game that is entertaining and difficult for any level of player. 

There are a limited number of shots you can take on each level forcing the player to be frugal. Pay attention to your health as it is also a scarce resource. I liked both features of the game as so many games these days allow for unlimited ammunition and health.

28189,I really liked this tileset based on the pictures its for sure better than the default tileset.

28191,im not sure how to contact the asset creator for this as i want to know if they used ai to make the parts. there are some sprite inconsistencies present and i know this to be a common issue within ai generators. i was concerned after being deceived by another asset maker so make sure when you download assets (especially on itch.io) to reach out and ask since no laws are in place to have them state upfront (its a shame we have to coerce transparency). once i can confirm if the product does not use ai i can give a proper review other than the sprite errors and colour inconsistencies.,0

28199,"Alien Land is a bit of Chinese shovelware that seems to have been dumped on Steam as a cash grab.  Is it an asset flip? I'm not sure, but probably.  It's very badly made, whatever it is.  It's supposed to be a hybrid Tribes like city builder and TD game, although I think the TD elements are missing...  It's difficult to tell how to play because there's no tooltips, and a short, badly translated passage on how to click on stuff with your mouse (oh so helpful).  You can work it out, however, there's no point in doing so, this really is shockingly bad.

This game has been translated from into English... badly.  If this was done through Google Translate, Google Translate should feel ashamed of itself.  Regardless, the language in this game is broken and will put off a lot of gamers.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  In fact the assets are incredibly poor quality, and combined with the locked resolution, they look fuzzy and awful.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

There's also some graphical distortion, some of the UI elements are broken and take up about half the screen... you can play around them, but it's a truly terribly experience trying to do so. 

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

Alien Land has the ridiculous, laughable price of around $5 USD, it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.

28200,"Nobody's Home is the shortest entry in the VCRPG series, but I still thought it was a worthwhile experience. Good writing, lots to explore, and a few secret endings to discover. It's a light dose of horror, and short enough to be experienced in an hour and a half- and for the record, I don't think those are bad qualities.

The premise and setting are eerily hilarious and the ""working things out as you go"" is quite intuitive!
It only takes around 15-20 minutes to beat for the first time, but there are several endings to it! Definetly a recommendation for a short and unique fix!",1

28281,"Cannon Block Ball is a browser game/web app that's been dumped on Steam as if it was a fully fledged PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy web developers.  The game is an unabashed, lazy ripoff of Angry Birds (Copyright Rovio/Sega, 2009).  Many lazy ""amateur"" developers don't pay attention to their obligations under copyright law, and often steal the ideas of actual, real game developers without credit, such as the ""developer"" here has done.  At this stage no legal action has been taken by Rovio/Sega against the ""developer"" here, but it's never off the table, as previous copyright law cases have shown.

Putting aside the unethical intellectual bankruptcy of stealing someone else's game concept for profit, this is also breaking that unwritten law of stealing other people's game ideas... you should at least try to do better than the game you're ripping off.  Cannon Block Ball is considerably worse than Angry Birds.

Once more this is an attempt from Nannings to scam PC gamers into paying them for a game that you can play for free in your web browser.  This is unethical and insulting to PC gamers on Steam.  Putting aside the fact this is a scam and nobody should buy it, from a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

While there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.

The game features simple, cartoony 2D graphics, of the type you normally expect to see in low effort mobile apps.  3D graphics programming does require a degree of skill and competence and unfortunately not all developers have the budget or talent to deliver this, despite 3D graphics cards hitting the mainstream in the 1990's.  Considering this is being evaluated as a PC game, having the graphics phoned in like this isn't going to result in a high quality, visually impressive game that PC gamers are used to seeing.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

The very poor quality of this game puts it squarely on-par with ancient 1990's Flash/Java games, and given it's 2024 (and this was released not so far back in 2023), gamers and the industry expect and deserve better than this kind of low effort shovelware.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

So, should you buy this free browser game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Once more we see greedy devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is $1 USD, but it's free to play on the web.  Web developers must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a premium for a free browser game just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this can be played free elsewhere, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  Who do they think we are?  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

28306,"[b]Total duration: 2 hours 11 minutes, with 10 minutes basically being bonus beta tracks or something[/b]

Real neat soundtrack. For me personally, there's around 20 minutes worth of background music from the area tracks like Hoho or Bass Basement, but for the rest, I just feel like I'd rather focus appreciating them fully when they play.

I also just bought this to support it, but honestly, there's a couple of my favorites that justifies this purchase. Mutilla is one of the best tracks for me, which makes it a delightful surprise that this version has a slightly different 10 second start than on [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-k7vh21iaM]youtube[/url].
[b]Update, checked on 18 September '23: It seems that this very link now has the later-mentioned keyboard rhythms in, so this paragraph may no longer be relevant.[/b] I think the one here is a bit more bass-y (?), while the one on youtube is lighter but crunchier in a good way. But also. [u]the one here has a constant, rhythmical keyboard chord to it that Youtube's doesn't![/u]. (which goes to mean that these are 100% different versions of the track; if the youtube version will suddenly get added to the album because of this, then I hope the old one stays in the album)

I do feel like I would've loved to get ""Bassy Bass (Ancient Archive variation)"" though, because those play in-game and aren't available here. I know they don't sound particularly good, but, would've been nice to have!

I'm glad the default suspense music (""Uh Oh!"") and the final boss fight music, are each their own separate tracks, only with a similar first-minute build up, with the latter using the former as some sort of prelude. Again, the same part plays slightly differently, so having both to listen to is nice!

Also the muffled version of ""Essential Albums"" (that plays during the Pop Up Shop in Hellblivion) isn't here in the album. I do love that track in its intended glory, for sure! (Minor spoiler)[spoiler]How it plays near the end is comedic gold[/spoiler]. But still, it's a different, neat variant.

In the end, I think that's pretty much all tracks accounted for. So yeah.

28320,"my personal favorite aircraft to fly in this game, its definitely not the best one in the game, but its a absolute blast to fly.

the main pros is in its speed, jamming, BVR, and SEAD. in those roles its a absolute beast of an aircraft due to its sweeping wings and VERY powerful afterburner, jamming pods, AIM 54's, and having TSD along with good SEAD missile options.

its cons are in its agility, flight cost, and hardpoint slots. because of its size and weight its turn radius is less then ideal, you CAN dogfight in it, although your chances of winning are reduced, so keep your distance. its flight cost is very expensive so on missions with only 100K IF your using jamming pods you probably wont be able to rearm. its limited hardpoint slots is not something that needs to be changed as its hardpoint slots are realistic, im saying its a con because the other jets in the game can hold much more.

overall, its NOT the best jet in the game by any means but it is up there due to its VERY big pros, awesome bird!!",1
28321,This DLC addition to VTOL Vr is amazing. It‚Äôs a future version of an f14 swept wings and all. With this dlc you gain access to its EW capabilities which are pods attached to the aircraft to offer things like noise and drfm jamming. There are also the deployable decoy pods. A couple weird things with the plane: 1 it‚Äôs super ‚Äúfloaty‚Äù at low speeds. Not exactly a bad thing because this is how it‚Äôs designed just something to be aware of. 2 it‚Äôs stupid fast even at low twr but the maneuverability is lower than other planes.

With unusually low drag with wings swept back, accelerated up to mach 1.44 in level flight at about 50 feet altitude, then climbed to about 84,000 feet in a continuous steep climb, better in this test than any other jet in this game by a significant margin.  Doesn't pull the most AOA, but great acceleration and energy retention.  I love this jet.",1
28333,"The only way I can put this is... Big aircraft (they called it's inspiration a 'flying cloud' for a reason) with a tail-hook the size of a postage stamp. I forgot my wrist strap, and the unfortunate controller is now somewhere across the room, I need to go see if it survived after being tossed when my arms went up in a cheer. A cheer at finally managing to catch the 2 wire in what can only be described as a controlled *crash* of a landing. If you can 3-wire consistently, I doff my hat to thee. The more I tried and failed to catch a wire, ANY wire, the more I became convinced that mastery of the EF-24 could make a man a better boyfriend, such was the hand-eye coordination and multitasking required.

Right, the difficulties I've had in my horrible carrier skills notwithstanding: it's FUN, even if I spent much of my time swearing at it. It is BIG, both in size (see above), and how it flies (even when not trying to land). You can't throw it around the air like you can the Tyro or base aircraft, so you have to make very deliberate movements to get the most out of it. The sweeping wings change a lot about how it flies. You don't notice this in the 'auto' position (forward and to the left on that lever) as much, but manually messing with it does interesting things (made finding out that there WAS an auto setting kinda nice).  If you get the right combination of altitude, airspeed, and over-G, you can do some pretty surprising turns. But doing so bleeds speed very quickly and you'll be wallowing afterward.

It's got F-45 (totally-not-an-F-35) styled touchscreens, which... honestly works for this aircraft better than you'd expect, even if it feels weird not seeing old-school gauges in a Tomcat Analogue. You have a lot more control over the RADAR than you do in the F-45 (which most folks don't even know you can use instead of the datalink/TSD) and even a bit more than the F/A-26B gives you. It's as close to DCS-level as I've seen VTOL get.

And that brings us to the back seat: The pilot *can't* fully control the RADAR. The back-seater has the ability to set altitude, pilot only has Azumith (direction) and actually selecting a target. to use the AIM-54 properly, you will *need* two people.the rear seat can also swap SOI with the left control stick. That's something that I missed comparing VTOL with any game that uses my X52. Having to let go of a control and *physically move your hand to swap sensors* takes a notable chunk of time, and you can't adjust throttle/stick while you're doing it depending on hand used. So a pair of players, one almost completely focused on flying, and one almost completely focused on weapons/systems use, is going to be a very dangerous pair indeed. The downside of this, unlike the AH-94 and T55, is that it really doesn't work great solo. That's all before we get to the electronic warfare stuff which I haven't been able to mess with.

All in all, a fantastic aircraft (which fortunately didn't kill my controller upon finding it).",1
28334,"So basically this is the only jet I fly in VTOLVR, although a couple of statements before you buy:

1. It's either you going Mach 1.7, or your stalling.
2. When you use the radar, toggle on the hud, it's helpful.
3. As an EWO, you need to help the pilot jam stuff, most of the people (that are in the pilot seat) know how to use the radar and TGP, don't take the SOI like a bitch.
4. the plane is huge, unlike the t55 it could get stuck on the airfield runways signs (the yellow ones), when u get stuck just eject.

looks like I have said only negative things but, these are the only things that are wrong with this plane which I have found out to this day. this game is incredible..................... just but the damn plane.",1
28335,Every new DLC plane is literally a completely different experience when playing. very good,1
28336,"Even though I'm disliking it at the moment, I don't regret buying it and it's probably worth it for many especially ones which want to dive into EW. It's beatifully modeled and you can tell that a lot of exertise and love went into creating the EF 24 but unfortunately I'm not having fun with it and am a bit dissapointed. Theoretically the plane gives you a lot of options but to me it seems like you only be left with one, which is EW.

Why I don't like it:
- Can carry only less than half as much as a FA26b, I think you can carry the least amount of weapons from any jet in VTOL. The FA26b even gives the option to carry weapons instead of extra fuel but the EF 24 can only carry the fule tanks with no option to put ammunition on them instead.
- Super sluggish to fly, doesn't want to turn and is bad at dog fights even with extended wings. Even though the 26b woul carry what feels like three times as much the EF 24 would with less load still fly much worse and generally less fun.
- Seems to be only worth for EW (which other planes now can do as well to some degree) but is not good for multi-role things like having enough stuff with you to fight air and ground targets after another. The description of the jet says its a normal jet adapted for EW but then I don't get why by that it becomes underwhelming at all other roles. 
- The roll the 24 is good at is pretty boring in the type of flying we do. While you can jamm and decoy stuff to get close to targets you then don't carry enough with you to deal damage so all you can do is a support roll and you will need others do the fun work.
- All together make the EF-24 pretty much useless for the kind of missions I fly with a friend currently because instead we are better off using two 26b, carry more, be two targets instead of one and much more agile. 

What it needs so I could have fun with it:
- A bit better maneuverbility and less sluggish to fly, when having the wings spread it should not fly like a brick and be at least halfway decent in dogfights but at the moment it just doesn't want to pull any gs. Would be cool if I could use manually spreading the wings as more of an advantage in dog fights but  it just makes it sligtly less bad.
- Higher amount of weapons to carry so we are not empty as quick and can be equipped for both air and ground targets at once. Why can I not put more bombs/rockets on one mounting point or chose weapons instead of fule tanks like on some other planes like the FA26. 

Some background info why I don't like it:
What I currently do most is flying coop missions with friends, mostly dynamic ones where it's about taking an airfield with e.g. 4 air targets and 8 ground targets or cleaning a city nearby with 10-15 ground targets and other random things. Because the EF-24 can cary only very few weapons we are constantly out of ammo and would spend most time flying back to a base for rearming. Because of the bad capacity it's also hardly possible to prepare yourself for multiple tasks like having some bombs and anti radar missiles while still having enough AIM120 and AIM9 to defend yourself against air targets. When a friend and I each fly a FA26b which carries like twice us much rockets and bombs than the EF-24 we can take out several other jets still have enough bombs left to clean ground targets or big part of a city. With the EF-24 we can either have enough for air targets or for some ground targets but by far not enough for both especially if we woul go for sharing the cockpit instead of flying each our own jet. Because of this in most missions we go back to using the FA26b again which is a shame as I think the 26 didn't age well and with its bigger sized cockpit feels much less immersive to sit in as in the T55 or EF24. I would have loved to move to a new jet but have to go back to the old one just because it's far superior in versaitlity and also maneuverability.

Edit: Now I've also tried the F45 again and its much more effective than the EW24. It can jam without the need to carry pods (just less options and maybe a bit less effective), it can carry more weapons and still pull more Gs which makes evading missiles much easier. I can dominate situations alone in the F45 where we would struggle hard sharing cockpits in the EW24 and the fact that instead of flying in the EWO seat my friend can fly another F45 in coop missions makes it 10times more effective and fun that the EW24. Currently I can't see a reason using the EW24 until it can carry a bit more and fly less like a brick.",0
28337,"[b]PROS AND CONS BELOW THESE WALLS OF TEXT FOR TL;DR PEOPLE[/b]

This DLC is essentially what we would've had in real life if the corrupt hack named Cheney never existed. The aircraft's body is a modernized version of the world-famous F-14 Tomcat, while the cockpit area is packed full of touchscreens similar to the F-45A to facilitate it's unique ability: [b]ELECTRONIC WARFARE[/b]. With this aircraft, you gain the ability to deceive enemy radar systems using a combination of jamming pods and decoy missiles (that can also jam enemy radar, how fun!) in order to bypass and neutralize them easier than ever before! It's primarily built for two people (who both own the DLC) much like the AH-94, with one person focusing on the EW systems while the other focuses on flying and fighting, but both can be done by a lone pilot with enough focus and willpower. 

Besides the jamming pods and decoy missiles, this plane also has access to the AIM-54 Phoenix, a long-range, heavy-payload, radar-guided air-to-air missile that was exclusively used by the Tomcat, allowing you to obliterate enemies from afar! It's also as fast as a bullet, capable of speeds of up to mach 2.6 (maybe even faster) and is the fastest aircraft in VTOL VR to date. It's not perfect (see below as to why I think so), but for the low price (and those beautiful variable-sweep wings), it's a must-buy without a doubt.

PROS:
1: Tomcat. Need I say more?
2: EW is fun, the jamming and decoys add a new layer of complexity to air combat operations.
3: This aircraft is [i]fast[/i], [b][i]really fast[/i][/b]. Perfect if you have the need... the need for [b]SPEED[/b]!!!
4: The Phoenix missile is a [i]beast[/i] in BVR engagements, capable of going far and hitting hard.
5: Seems to take quite a beating and still fly (from my experience as a missile sponge).
6: Only $12 at full price, won't break your bank.

CONS:
1: Solo players will likely struggle with utilizing the EW mechanics effectively while piloting.
2: It can't turn as much as other aircraft can in a dogfight without ripping the wings fully off, and you'll likely hear a stall warning for most of the fight. It [i]can[/i] dogfight, but it will probably take practice and skill.
3: On afterburners, it [b]DRAINS[/b] fuel. You can get like 20 minutes of constant afterburners [b]WITH EXTERNALS[/b] before fuel dries up, so you'll have to stay off of afterburners when it's not needed.
4: Can't split weapons with EWO, only one or the other can launch missiles. I'd say just to leave that job to the pilot to avoid confusion.
5: Not much space for weapons, and no cluster bombs or rocket pods are available.
6: Personally wish the pilot seat was less like the F-45A and more like the F/A-26B, I just would've preferred a more ""analog"" setup.
7: EWO gets no MP3 player :(

28338,"A great addition with an amazing cockpit and flight controls 
just dont forget to jam the hell out of any friendly in your area",1
28339,"This plane is pretty spectacular. its a great multirole, but it's role as an electronic warfare/support aircraft is it's priority.

it excells in jamming and is the best in the game at jamming.
it carries mostly Anti Air munitions, filling it's secondary role very well: air superiority.

in terms of air superiority, it has an amazing loadout. it falls somewhere between the T-55 tyro and the F/a-26 wasp. it carries much more than the T-55, it has MUCH more engine power, but it has no pitch limiter and it rolls slower. In the hands of a skilled pilot, it can hold it's own, however in the hands of an equally skilled pilot, the F/a26 would beat it, even if it would be a challenge to do so.
The Ef-24G also carries the long range Aim-54 missile, which is exclusive to it.

Compared to the F-45 ghost, this plane has the upper hand in a dogfight.

in terms of ground-pounding, this plane is quite modest. you have 3 anti radar missiles, 2 cruise missiles, the dumb bombs, 2 gps bombs and 1 laser guided bomb. in other words, it is very old-timey in terms of ground-pounding and carries less than the F/26, which carries an amazing loadout... but the Ef-24G still does a great job, better than the T-55 and very slightly worse or equal to the F-45.",1

NOTE: While there really should be an Electronic Warfare tutorial, you can find the EF24G Flight Manual on the VTOL VR discord which goes over many of the EW mechanics if you don't mind reading some.",1
28359,"honestly the best plane for vtol to date, i really like the cockpit design and electronic warfare is really fun, although you NEED a second person to do it (its not an option) anyway i have literally never bought something so fast in my life",1
28360,"Got around to learning how to use it, it's a blast to use. 
I'm usually not a huge Tomcat/Top gun guy, but the more 4.5 Gen feel of this thing sold it for me. 
And the Electronic Warfare systems give you a whole new play style to toy with.

Though sluggish in rate fights it can definitely pack a punch in terms of speed as well. 
Would recommend it highly for anyone, even if you think the movie ""Top Gun"" is overrated",1
28361,"Another fantastic addon for VTOL. The EF-24G is complex and well thought out. It adds two unique styles of play, it has versatility as a straightforward flighter, or can be used in it's very complex EW role. Long live the JamCat",1

It's gonna be hard to learn, most likely needs 2 people, but this thing is a workhorse of maneuverability and weapons/EW capability. Seriously, what are you waiting for? It's a 5th gen Tomcat.",1
28363,"*Highway to the danger zone intensifies!!!!!*
In all serious tho this is one of the best DLC/aircraft in the game. Carrier ops are more fun to do as you feel much like Mr Top Gun, EW is amazing and has made SEAD a lot harder(Which is something i prefer, maybe not for beginners), also you can troll friendlys with the EW pods now so enjoy free flight or any multiplayer mission with one person making your RWR beep for no reason 
Thanks Baha, for making my Christmas a lot better.",1
28364,"Very fun to fly and the EW is a great addition to the game. Haven't gotten a chance to fly with someone else yet but the EW is somewhat manageable flying solo. 100% worth buying.

The plane itself is VERY fast, you'll burn through your fuel in around 20 mins with the 2 fuel tanks that you can carry. The AIM-54s are great, and will win you most BVR fights you do in multiplayer. Air to ground ordinance is limited and I don't tend to engage ground targets nearly as much as with the other jets but the option is there. It also can't really dogfight since you'll rip your wings off but the AIM-54s will almost always get you a good few kills regardless (and you can carry a fair few AIM-9s or even AIM-120s as well just in case).

TLDR: good fun, super cheap, tomcat go vrooom.

But seriously this is great. Jamming is a full time job in the back seat but let's say you don't want to roll with a jammer and just want to be a Super Tomcat. Well that back seat is still useful. Take over radar management and keep the bad guys in the radar's view while the pilot steers and shoots. Still a lot of fun. Or how about doing recon for other units? Marking GPS targets for allies or yourselves to drop an entire payload of JDAMs and hit dozens of targets all at once in a display of shock and awe not seen since the Gulf War.

Simply put, this DLC is awesome.",1

Does not include a tutorial on how to use said system, that's not great.

Also only has one unique mission included as far as I can tell (you can do free fly and the other generic missions that the other planes have). I obviously haven't been able to beat the single mission since I have no idea how the plane works . . . because there's no tutorial.

The variable wings are cool though.",0
28368,"This is again a game where I would like to have the option to just give a ""mixed"" review, and while I usually give a thumps up because others review games on minor nitpicks too harshly, I can't bring myself to it this time.
In general the game has a good atmosphere, it felt more like a horror game the two prior games, and the criticism about the game being too dark isn't invalid, but not a deal breaker since illumination is provided plenty. Also adding jumping and weapons to the game was a welcomed sight, since I missed the janky platforming in the second game. The story was also keeping me engaged enough to not feel discouraged by the presented flaws.

However, the negatives:
- The game is absolutely linear. You follow light spots to progress through a level, and that's it
- The combat didn't feel necessary. In the first game defeating an enemy opened up more recordings in the zone, here it was just there to have busy work and sometimes collect a singular voice line.
- The EVP content was almost non existent. While the first 2 games' main gameplay focus was deciphering voice lines and piecing together the story, it was now just a byproduct. You automatically collect 95% of the voice lines, they are automatically deciphered and you just need to piece together a message after a zone. The only remaining gameplay in that regard were the camera recordings that are optional content.
- To the prior point: in order to end the game you better be thorough collecting the voice lines, because otherwise you can find yourself replaying levels to even start the ending sequence.
- There were no puzzle elements, just walking through the level without any interactions with your environment and little to no environmental story telling.

So overall, the game did some things right, but lost its unique playstyle in the process. After playing the game, it confirmed to me that Sylvio 1 was by far the best entry in the series.",0
28369,"I had to restart this game from scratch because of a bug that makes multiple copies of the same phrase in the ghost records thing, but I finished it in the end.

The whole ""phrase placement"" puzzle that's very prominent and important is tough af and could be more streamlined, perhaps the same way the songs are used by isolating the correct phrase in the correct place from further movement instead of having to reconfigure ten phrases into something coherent; the idea of 100% correct only is agonizing for game play. I easily spent a good three hours additional just trying to finagle the phrases into the correct position.

The four weapons in the game could easily be reduced to two; one rifle type that can zoom and a pistol/smg type that alternates firing modes (semi/auto) depending on clicking or holding the mouse button. 

Hope this game will be patched for new players in the future though, especially with the puzzles in mind. I did like every other part of the game but the puzzles hurt me bad.",1
28370,"If this is the first time you've seen the name ""Sylvio,"" then please understand that this is actually the third title in a series. Chances are, if you decide to start with BW before Sylvio 1 or 2, you'll be confused and frustrated, as the game starts immediately from the ending of the second title. I'd highly recommend at least experiencing Sylvio 1 before jumping into BW, as both games are very similar. 

For fans of Sylvio, that last sentence should probably catch your attention. I was wary when this game was first announced, I loved the atmosphere and music from Sylvio 2, but it was a huge downgrade from the preceding title. I'm happy to say that this release feels like a return to form. 

Continuing from Sylvio 2, Juliette now finds herself on a dead alien planet that looks eerily similar to our own. A strange device on the surface asks you to input an unknown code, and Juliette descends down into the depths of the planet to find it. Darkness envelopes you, strange glowing statues are scattered everywhere, and gravity defies all logic as you clamber around ruins that are illuminated by small pinpricks of light. This time around, Juliette has a companion by the name of ""Lee"", and unseen guide that helps her traverse the area. It's a refreshing change from the first two games, as the story is slowly revealed through the two's frequent conversations, and it requires less piecing together compared to the earlier titles. 

But how does BW compare to Sylvio 1? Hard to say. It's funny to see BW tagged with ""exploration"", as the game is pretty linearized. You follow set paths through the levels and you can't deviate at all. The only way through the game is forwards, and it'll drag you kicking and screaming if it has to. Linear levels aren't a huge deal breaker for me, but it can start to get old when the environments are too samey and drab. Every level that I've seen thus far can be described as ""ruined buildings surrounded by trees."" Even Sylvio 2 had unique levels (e.g. the hotel, the farm, the church), so it's a bummer to see BW's set pieces all blend together. That being said, I'm actually struggling to find some collectibles, so it's not linear to the point that it becomes a total snoozefest. Puzzles have also been removed, the game is now more combat focused. There's only a single enemy type, floating spirits, that you have to fend off, but you're given multiple weapons to choose from? A pneumatic pistol, a pneumatic shotgun, even a pneumatic submachine gun! I'm not exactly sure as to why they're included, as Sylvio isn't meant to be an FPS shooter. 

And yet despite the problems, I'm having so much fun. It feels like I'm replaying Sylvio 1 all over again. Sylvio has to be one of my favorite indie games of all time, and I recommend it because of its tone and atmosphere, not because it does anything innovative with its gameplay. I would recommend BW for that same reason as well: you walk through empty, desolate environments, with nothing to keep you company except for the cursed messages hiding in the static and the haunting synth chords of the soundtrack. The more you descend, the more you learn about the events that transpired here, growing that unsettling pit inside of you, the feeling that you're about to stumble across something truly evil and terrifying. We're not here to go in guns blazing, we're meant to dial back, sit tight, get lost in our own thoughts. So draw your blinds, turn off the lights, crank your volume all the way up. You've got some Sylvioing to do.",1
28371,"I would honestly recommend playing both Sylvio 1 and 2 before playing this.  I went out of the way to buy them before I played S:BW and while the 2nd game is a bit of a hard play I enjoyed my time getting here.

That being said, this games pretty nice.  It has this very moody vibe the entire time as you try to piece together what happened to the 18 humans and the astronauts that visited this alien planet.  There's moments of clarity that feel really emotional throughout the story and I found myself really enjoying the conversations Juliette had with Lee.  The gun returns from the first game but really isn't here to solve puzzles anymore, instead its mostly to fight the ghosts that will try to impede you.  The actual combat isn't anything too spectacular (and can be disabled) but I did find in the last two areas I found myself needing to conserve ammo or run away from enemies to survive.

Sylvio: Black Waters feels like a strange continuation of the previous two games.  There's still so many questions that need to be answered involving what or who ""Sylvio"" even is, and what was up with the aliens at the end of the 2nd game.  Though as a story on it's own I think it's pretty enjoyable.  It's absolutely a step up over Sylvio 2 and the story telling was fun.  The game IS very dark, though it does help give it that moody feel, and there's plenty of lights throughout the game to help navigate through the darkness.

Took me about 7hrs to beat, while completing almost all side objectives.",1
28372,"Good game. If the game is too dark... deal with it. Turn up your brightness, or just follow the lights that literally take you to the end of the game. Still awesome.",1
28373,"I was surprised they were making a 3rd Sylvio game. I really enjoyed this one. I highly recommend playing the first two before playing this one otherwise you will be confused. The game is DARK but I think I understand the developers intentions pretty easily. Just follow the lights it won't steer you wrong. The ambient music is great, the combat is an absolute dumpster fire. I may turn off enemy encounters on my next playthrough just because of how clunky and ridiculous it is.  I definitely recommend playing this game if you've played the other ones.  It's still not as good as the first game, maybe a little better than the 2nd. All in all worth a playthrough


8.1/10 will play again",1
28374,"About 9 years ago a very unique and underappreciated game by the name of Sylvio was released. It dealt with a really curious concept of EVP ‚Äì Electronic Voice Phenomena and made for a really cool and creepy ghost horror adventure with light combat mechanics. It had just the right amount of ambition for the one-person development team at Stroboskop, so while it was somewhat ugly looking and had lots of minor frustrating issues and bugs, the experience was unlike any other so the game was worth playing anyway. The game was to be followed up by an equally ambitious sequel that would move EVP research from audio to video, but, sadly, the Kickstarter campaign to support the development failed. Sylvio 2 that we got  two years later was simplified in most ways in comparison to the original and while it still had cool ideas (and one of its sequences with spectrograms still gives me nightmares), it was somewhat disappointing. A few years after the release of Sylvio 2, the developer decided to stop making games.

However, the rise of the ‚ÄúHaunted PS1 Demo Disc‚Äù and ‚ÄúDread X Collection‚Äù communities, releasing short form horror titles, got Stroboskop excited again and after participating in Dread X Collection 5 with the short title ‚ÄúKarao‚Äù, they‚Äôve decided to return to bigger games with this new release of Sylvio: Black Waters. Which I‚Äôm very happy about‚Ä¶ yet I can‚Äôt say that the resulting game is very good.

So, how does this game play? This is a first person action adventure that focuses mostly on story exploration with the story itself being a very bizarre mix of sci fi and folk horror. It‚Äôs difficult to explain and I can‚Äôt say it works in the end, but the idea is intriguing. The game world, just like in the first game, is divided into several linear levels, all of which are conceptually connected to a central overworld. Though in case of this game you get two overworlds ‚Äì one from which you get to revisit the linear levels (something that the original release of Sylvio didn‚Äôt allow), and one where you get to drive a‚Ä¶ bike-thing with a radio to follow the light to get to the next linear level. That last transitional type of level is, frankly, odd as it lacks the fun of exploration of the first two games (where you had a car and a boat respectively) and seems to be added just for ‚Äúcool vibes‚Äù I guess?

And you do get combat back, after it was completely absent in the second game. This time around your weapon doesn‚Äôt solve puzzles and is just used to fight ghost-like entities, but the main focus of the encounters is changed. In the original game you just had to defeat ghosts that spawned at specific parts of the exploration and that was it. In this game, all ghosts spawn from glowing human statues that you can usually see beforehand. And if you break the statue before it cracks open on its own, the ghost won‚Äôt spawn. But some of the statues do not spawn ghosts and your ammo resources are limited, so the gimmick here is basically on noticing the statues from far enough and deciding if you want to spend your resources on destroying them to potentially avoid the fight later. It‚Äôs a cute idea, that sets a very good methodic pace to your ‚Äúexploration‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt say it was that exciting.

Especially since, I did write ‚Äúexploration‚Äù in quotation marks for a reason. Sadly, for all of the cool ideas with levels changing gravity and folding onto itself and the potentially cool combat mechanics the game is aggressively linear. To avoid players accidentally landing on surfaces before the gravity is the right way around or falling between cracks, there are invisible walls everywhere and all you do is just follow the lights. Not because it‚Äôs easier to do, but because you can‚Äôt not do that. Granted, there are still plenty of spots you can fall and fly through the game potentially forever (perhaps there is a kill plane but I have not hit it when I had these bugs happen). It‚Äôs a real shame because even though Sylvio 2 was also hand-holding you constantly, it gave you plenty of choice and illusion of choice to feel more interesting than it was on a mechanical level. Whereas here, the game is the opposite to all of the cool ambitious ideas that made the original so interesting. It also contrasts heavily with something like Paradise Killer, which is more than happy to let you bunny hop through its world however you want, becoming a huge part of the fun you get from that game.

As for the EVP ‚Äì it‚Äôs still here, but so oversimplified and not interesting, it feels barely a part of the game, despite being vital to the game‚Äôs completion. You just gather the creepy voices and the big ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù of the game isn‚Äôt about finding them, but about arranging them in order, which is often very poorly executed as there is only one correct solution, even if the lines presented can be set in any order and still be grammatically correct and mean the exact same thing. There is sound manipulation, with a video component included, in fact, but it‚Äôs not very interesting or engaging and is done for the optional stuff that doesn‚Äôt really lead into anything. In fact, most of the story here is just kinda ‚Äúvague creepy stuff‚Äù. And while the ending of the game might not be as silly as of the second title, it‚Äôs still more bizarre than good.

I am glad that Stroboskop is back into making games again. And purely in technical terms, I suppose Sylvio: Black Waters is the most competent project. But it‚Äôs also least memorable of the three and ends up feeling in some ways more disappointing even than the second game. I still enjoyed it, it has neat elements and cool atmosphere. But I can also easily see a lot of people completely dismissing this game and I won‚Äôt blame them.",1
28375,"Perhaps I need some story related context here, but I have absolutely no idea what's going on story wise and in my short time with the game so far I don't really feel compelled to figure it out. The game is dark yes, but it seems that was a stylistic choice based on some random plot device about the sun disappearing. However, this game is pretty boring to look at and the combat seems pointless. I'll probably play a little longer before refunding, but I don't think so. This definitely isn't worth the price because it feels like a half-baked tech demo.",0
28376,"I usually don't write reviews, but I just have to for this game
Just finished my first playthrough and i loved every second of it!
The atmosphere and sound design is as perfect as ever and the soundtrack is so good as well, also I loved the premise of the story and though I would recommend playing the first two games of the series to understand the story a bit better, I think it can also be played as a standalone
Absolutely fantastic game <3",1

Great music and sound
the environments are atmospheric 
I also thought the voice acting was good.
The game is dark but uses points of light for navigation and i still found the environments to be interesting to take in. The mystery/story was compelling enough for me to finish it which is more then i can say for 80% of games in my library. 
I found the combat to be not great not terrible i found myself missing certain lines of phrases during combat encounters and i had to backtrack towards the end of the game which killed the pacing a bit. I think however that relative short length of the game was a good choice. Nothing overstays it's welcome and it does not become tedious.
Night sky radio lives rent free in my head.",1
28378,"I adore Dread XP games so it breaks my heart to give this game a poor review.  Dread XP games have a reputation for being good and spooky.  Sadly there is not much good here nor is there anything remotely spooky. From the beginning of the game, your entire objective is to follow lights on the ground as they lead you through different areas.  The game is dark, sure, but that's how the lights lead you. 

As you move from light to light, there will be some that have an extra sparkle, which make up the crux of the ""game"".  You will get a sentence or a phrase of a short story and the next sparkly spot gives another sentence.  You then need to put the story in order to get it told to you.  Since you can just hold down the button and it will tell you in what order the phrase goes, there's not much riddling to it. 

Same with tv monitors that you can pick up.  While it's a neat mechanic, it's totally optional and, as far as I can tell, serves no real purpose other than to hear a song. For these you will need to listen to a recording and then either speed it up or slow it down, backwards and forwards, to unscramble a phrase. Over and over, until you have all the lyrics  Neat, but pointless.

There are enemies, but again they are just sparkling lights that don't really seem to do much other than harass you, so much so that you can disable them in the menu.

The voice acting in the game is fantastic, Juliette is superb, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the ""game"". I put game in quotes because you are literally just walking, from light to light, through the entire game looking for ways to progress to the next area.",0
28379,"My first experience with Sylvio: Black Waters wasn't very good. It's a little rough on the edges (ugly interface, not having a loading screen etc) and it's very confusing at first. Had to see a walkthrough to discover what I was doing wrong. After that, I decided to restart and actually had a much better experience.

Sylvio: Black Waters is actually a very beautiful game, with it's dark, gloomy, surreal and mysterious landscapes. The story is kinda abstract at first but everything starts to make sense like a puzzle. Actually, it's more straight foward than the previous games, with a sad, dark and twisted sci-fi tale.

It's basically an exploration game with ""words"" collection that forms the lyrics of songs and stories that you have to solve.  It's not so scary like the previous games and that's actually a good thing. The atmosphere is very dense, transitioning from ominous to melancholic, but never stressful. The synth soundtrack is brilliant and could easily be a score for a good sci-fi mystery movie. Audio wise, it's near perfect. There's light gun combat which can be avoided and even turned off, but I actually found it cool. 

It really needs some fixes (like the invisible walls that make the sniper practically useless) but it still a good game, mainly because of the atmosphere, the soundtrack and the mystery. 

Tip: when you finish a Lungs stage, you return to a hub. Find the ""office"" and follow the tracks. Then get the bike and follow the light until you find another track to a new Lungs stage. I noticed that I wasn't the only one who got stuck in the game because I didn't understand this.",1
28380,"Sucks, it's too dark, it's a where do I go, what do i go game. I played for 30 mins until i fell through the map. I can't image playing it any longer than i did. sorry",0
28381,"Just finished playing this (link at end of the review for anyone who wants to see a gameplay sample). I was torn on whether to give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I‚Äôve decided to give it a tentative thumbs up just because there were aspects of the game I liked. However, this is one of those games where I wish Steam had a neutral option.

I liked Sylvio and enjoyed both previous games. Sylvio: Black Waters is the third instalment, but I felt it wasn't as good. It's... a'ight, I guess? It picks up where Sylvio 2 left off, with protagonist Juliette on another world - presumably having been taken there by the aliens. I say 'presumably', because the game doesn't make any reference to said beings or explain who or what they were, as far as I'm aware. What ensues is an exploration of this world, unravelling the story of what happened there.

Story-wise, the game's... just okay. It was engaging enough for me to stick with it, but I was hoping for something more. The story of Sylvio: BW feels like its own thing, and as far as I could tell didn't seem to have any substantial connection to the lore established in the previous games. Maybe I'm missing something here...

The sound design is good, and the graphics are fine. People have mentioned that they are very dark, which is true - but the path you need to take is typically lit, so there's little chance of you getting lost (except perhaps in the main hub area, where the game might benefit from giving you a waypoint just so you know which direction you're sometimes meant to be going).

Now let's talk about gameplay. Something new in this game is the gravity mechanic. For instance, you enter a new level and everything looks normal; then you find a ladder at a peculiar angle, and as you climb it the world around you turns and shifts, gravity begins moving in a different direction, and now the walls have become the floor, etc. It's a clever gimmick that enables the dev to take what are quite compact levels and make them seem bigger than they actually are, as well as find unique places to hide ghosts to record, etc. The only downside is that the levels are all fairly linear, whereas this sort of mechanic would benefit from level designs that are much more open and less linear (i.e. giving you multiple paths, thus giving the player more of a challenge and incentivising them to explore every corner in order to find the path they need to get that one ghost recording that is positioned in an odd location, etc).

Another thing I liked about Sylvio: BW‚Äôs gameplay was that the gun mechanic of the original Sylvio was brought back - and the dev has definitely improved on it. In fact, there are four guns in Sylvio: BW: a pistol-type; a shotgun-type; an SMG; and even a sniper. Like the gun in the original Sylvio, they take more than one type of ammo: fluid-filled cartridges for short range, or marbles for longer distances. Throughout the world of Sylvio: BW you'll find statues - the remnants of the planet's inhabitants. Many are inert, but some hide hostile spirits (which look like human shapes made of golden particles, contrasting with the smoky hostile spirits of the original Sylvio). Wander too close to a statue containing a hostile spirit, and they'll bust out to attack. Which is where the different types of ammo come into play. If a spirit busts out, then you need to use the fluid cartridges. But if you have marbles, you could alternatively try destroying a statue before you get close enough to trigger the spirit within, negating any danger. But of course, not all statues contain spirits! However, if you look hard enough, you'll never run out of marbles - search every piece of abandoned furniture you find in the ruins.

Nonetheless, I did have some criticisms of the weapons. I'm not sure the game needed as many guns as it provides - the sniper feels redundant given that your other weapons still have considerable range when loaded with marbles. Furthermore, defeating hostile spirits doesn't yield anything. In the original Sylvio, eliminating a hostile spirit would give an EVP recording (which might reveal clues, waypoints, etc). But in Sylvio: BW, this isn't the case. It would have been good for there to be a bit more of a reward to fighting off the hostile spirits.

Which brings me to the main gameplay mechanic of all Sylvio games: EVP (electronic voice phenomena). The original Sylvio had you use your ghost-recording equipment to unscramble the audio of the dead to yield clues. Sylvio 2 then brought in the video camera mechanic, where you'd also get a visual recording that you had to scan through. This enabled some great creepy moments where you would see ghostly grey figures in the footage, which helped give Sylvio 2 a horror atmosphere without any jumpscares. So how does Sylvio: BW compare?

If I'm brutally honest, the EVP mechanics felt bland by comparison. I hate to say it, but I didn't think they were as good as the first two games. Partly it's because most of the levels are linear, and the locations of all ghostly voices are marked out by a particle effect that is easy to see. In contrast, the original Sylvio did things differently: whilst some voice locations would be marked with waypoints based on clues you found in recordings, some would not - instead, you'd have to use Juliette's microphone to zero in on them (prompting more careful exploration of surroundings). Even Sylvio 2, which went more overboard on the waypoints, still had certain points that would only appear once you found particular clues. But in Sylvio: BW, neither of these are a thing. The locations where you conduct recordings are just a bit too easy to find, I guess?

What about visual recordings? Have they been brought back from Sylvio 2? Well, yes - throughout each level, you'll find cameras with footage on them, which you can unscramble to get song lyrics. But it felt like a downgrade from Sylvio 2. Firstly, the song lyrics are optional - you don't have to find them all, and they don't tell you anything you won't figure out from the standard ghost recordings. Secondly, the footage on these cameras is bland, usually just a dark close-up of something in your surroundings. Don't expect to see any ghostly figures appearing in them to creep you out. I don't recall ever seeing a single one, and I was kind of disappointed, because Sylvio 2 did it really well. What this meant was that Sylvio: BW just wasn't as creepy as its predecessors, in my eyes.

Lastly, there were technical issues. In the hub areas, my frame rate would often stutter. Adjusting graphics settings didn't seem to help, but outside of the hub areas the frame rate stabilised. Whilst my PC is getting on in age, it's still beefy - so I'm of the opinion that the frame rate jitters indicate some optimisation issues in the hub areas? Another technical issue (and this one was frustrating) was in one of the Lungs levels. After being killed by a hostile spirit, the game had to reload from the last checkpoint. But it glitched, and the level didn't load properly - it didn't remember which way the 'world' was meant to be facing (going back to the gravity mechanic mentioned earlier), leaving me stuck on a ledge. Upon falling off, I ended up falling through the world indefinitely. I'll post this on the bugs thread and hopefully the dev can patch it, but it was annoying because I was quite far into the game, and no matter how many times I tried reloading, the glitch kept occurring (which forced me to restart the whole game).

With all that said, I'm sure you can see why I had a bit of a struggle deciding whether to give Sylvio: BW a thumbs up or thumbs down. I'll go with the former just because there were certain aspects I liked, but I'll caveat that with my view that this is probably (in my opinion, at least) the weakest entry in the Sylvio franchise.

28385,"Well worth the asking price.

OASIS: Tokyo blends elements from big publisher games that we're familiar with into an original and engaging game for a price well below what you'll play elsewhere. The game operates on a mission system similar to the raids of Tarkov, where players will deploy to wipe out gangs of thugs, assassinate high value targets, or upload viruses in server networks.

To assist you in this there is a wealth of weapons and weapon customization, cybernetic implants, and a hacking system reminiscent of Cyperpunk. I enjoyed min-maxing different cybernetic builds for my character; I lost track of time grinding missions in order to afford a new rifle, and then lost track of time again fleshing my rifle out with scopes, stocks, grips and other attachments. Getting back to my apartment and sorting through my stash after a grueling mission was extremely satisfying and with enough work I built myself up to a tuxedo and armor-wearing John Wick eliminating gang after gang with my rifle and sidearm only to get wiped out by a Setcom tactical team and start from square one again.

As others have said the AI has room for improvement, and I'd love to see improvements to movement such as a lean and crouch/prone system. But overall the game is a blast and seems to be a real up-and-comer.

28386,"This is honestly so much fun. I've been looking for a single-player Tarkov experience and this scracthes that itch. Gunplay is solid, I don't see any issues here at all. Inventory managing works great as well. Graphics aren't anything to right home about but the music is fun and the overall atmosphere is on the cusp of cyberpunk if you like that. 

Oh and as a big fan of cyberpunk-esque stuff in general, the cyberware feature (that's part of the normal game) is awesome. The fact that you can create builds from cyberware/augmentations is *chefs kiss*. The developer also included more than one game-mode (I believe there are three: a rogue-lite mode of the endgame, a survival (think OG MW3) game, and one more). Not even a necessary addition but the dev decided to make it and I'm grateful for the above-and-beyond. Best bang for your buck on Steam in my opinion.

I'm really happy with this game and am looking forward to whatever updates may come out of it. One thing I'd like to see is looting NPCs! And, if possible, a leaning mechanic.",1
28387,So I have only played three contracts or missions as of typing this I thought the game was actually really fun. The immediate tutorial is a little jarring but upon review of some of the info after hitting escape I got it all figured out although there are some weird things such as not being able to loot enemy bodies but there is plenty of loot scattered throughout the levels but a setting to maybe turn off lootable bodies and lootable enemy weapons would be very cool. Although i understand it would probably mess up the current in game economy as of now. Now to the gun play it does feel like a simpler weighty version of tarkov but in a yakuza subway mafia type setting its very pleasing to be honest but every time i played a mission all I was thinking was i want to lean around corners with q and e and I want to be able to crouch the stamina mechanic also slightly doubling as a health/shield is fine but the movement just feels limited if you can polish up all those things this game has a bright future although for six bucks its still worth it as of now.,1
28388,"I really really want to recommend this but its an unbelievably buggy ass mess. Starting the game for the first time made it run at 4000fps and then crashed, restarted and tried the tutorial.  the first 2 enemies the tutorial showed me fell through the floor after completely ignoring me to shoot a wall. the tutorial was unbelievably dark as well and really terrible at teaching you anything. I pushed through, played my first map, went alright had enemies clip through doors constantly which almost killed me. the hub area for some reason makes my PC chug, a PC that can run Doom Eternal.  I played my second mission and i started really liking it, i found a weapon stash of an mp5, scorpion, auto shotgun, and tons of other stuff. In this time i completely lost all my stamina, which is way way way too low, even if you can restore it in the hub, its worse that old cod sprint times. Another annoyance is swapping weapons in your inventory, you cant just drag and swap them, no you must drop them entirely, then put your weapon you want in the now open slot, look down and pick up your dropped gun.
the hub despite being a square is so damn confusing since its all untextured city corridors, i spend most my time there just forgetting which way was is the level starter. The players house is a random 2nd floor room in a stairwell too which got obnoxious to find everytime.
Here is where my biggest issue comes in.  You for some reason (that at least i know) cannot remove a mag from an equipped gun, you have to put it in your inventory to do so. so i go sure ill do that, theres no enemies, and the one Im tracking is in the next room, she doesn't know Im here, doors closed Im safe.  I suddenly hear her clunky voice line activate and see a shotgun barrel stick through a wall, Dead instantly. that's absolutely wild, and frustrating. 
I went that sucks, ill load up another level then, goodbye good loot that i unjustly lost. loaded in to enemies already looking at me, in the exact same map, despite being entirely across the city map apparently, i survived somehow, tried reloading my gun, for some reason despite not making it do so it dropped out of my inventory, despite doing the proper reload, struggling to find it i hear 4 more voices activate, and every single one gormlessly clips through the closed door and guns me down. Im taking a hiatus after that.

its really frustrating cause this game mechanically is everything ive wanted, a tactical customization single player looter shooter like tarkov. when the game works its so much fun, i l o v e inventory management, and upgrading loot through instanced areas, but stamina needs reworked, and these bots need some play testing.  i will cautiously hope and wait for better patches.",0

28390,"A neat little shooter that definitely can scratch the itch of getting in some singleplayer fps action! Enemy AI can be a bit silly sometimes, but other than that it's really solid!",1
28391,"I do recommend this game, but with a strong caveat that this thing is very obviously unfinished.
The missing features include:
- leaning
- proper medical health system [may be optional idk]
- AI being smart
- crouching, prone, stance management
- more maps
- npc loot

As it stands the game is really fun anyway, but it would be elevated if it had these things in it. Scratches the itch of Tarkov partially, albeit a greater variety of maps would be nice too.",1
28392,"It needs a lot of work in some areas, I.E you will die to enemies that aren't pointing guns at you, Enemy NPCs can spawn right next to you and instantly end your run, and the meta is to  sit behind a wall because the enemies are programmed to walk straight towards you immediately, and they'll often kill themselves when 20 of them try to stand in the same spot",1
28393,"no budget single player escape from tarkov in mildly cyberpunk alternate timeline near-future japan; take on a series of randomly generated raids to build to an endgame endurance run to the stalker zone and the endings. 

theres also some roguelite side modes and an endurance mode but theyre not very fleshed out. it is buggy; there was a bug where random enemies would be invincible, but it seems to have been stealth patched out. also the end game enemies like the cleaners will totally glitch out into distorted horrors so the only part you can reliably hit is their head.

also the balance is wonky, with most of the skills being useless, the cyberdecks being way less useful than ""killing your enemy with a gun,"" & m4 supremacy.

despite flaws i still had a lot of fun shooting thousands of cops in randomly generated offices for gun parts and i cant leave a negative review for a true indie game unless it is absolute garbage by a garbage person",1
28394,"Good game and has a great potential but lacks of content and lacks of randomness, ackward voice acting, werid AI and random generated level and bad weapon animations, bad tutorials and unintuitive UI and UX.

Okay, here's the updated review of extra few hours playing. After you reached certain level, you able to enter something like ""find a oasis"". It's like a campaign, you passing through all the randomly generated level until the end.

The concept is good but the problem is really unbalanced. It's roguelike so I can understand sometimes you need some luck, but it's too much hard. I packed my inventory full of 5.56mm ammo (around 600 + 5 30 round mag) but I already died 3 times because the lack of ammunition. I never found any 5.56mm spawn in any map, and containers and boxes, and the store too. Only shotshells, 9mm pistol bullets and 5.45mm ammo spawned. I rerolled the store everytime until it reaches the end of the chance but 5.56mm never spawned.

I'm dead fucking serious. Need more larger backpack and ammo vest, need more adjusted and acceptable RNG. Why the game keep spawns weapon with a different type of ammo so that can't be used? It's really bu11sh1t.",0
28395,"If you played Receiver and thought, ""it sure would be nice if someone turned this into a game""... this might be the game for you.

OASIS: Tokyo is undeniably a diamond in the rough. Graphics are bog-standard Unity schlock. Movement, aiming, and physics are gloriously dysfunctional. Missions are repetitive. Enemy AI is bewilderingly stupid. User interface is janky. There can't be more than 3 songs and a couple dozen voice lines in the whole game. Unexplained FPS drops are unfortunately common.

And yet, it nails the looter-shooter sweetspot so hard, it's worth taking a second look despite everything. Gunplay and core game mechanics are far more developed than a first impression might imply.

Guns are fun to fiddle with and fun to shoot. Variety of weapons and attachments is decent. Ammo and inventory management are meaningfully integrated into FPS gameplay. Enemy encounters almost always pose a genuine threat. Layers of branching build progression and customization make additional playthroughs worthwhile. Difficulty settings ensure the game is accessible to practically any skill level. And gameplay never feels slow, thanks to stacking energy drink buffs cranking your character's movement up to speeds that would put Sonic the Hedgehog in the ER.

At $6.99 USD, the dollars-to-fun ratio is a no-brainer.",1
28396,"Plays too stiff, insultingly unfair initial mission where multiple ai camp you in the dark and can take unarmored multiple headshots while you have a shitty pistol and limited ammo, sets the tone for the rest of the game, not worth the money don't buy it.",0

Was a bit put off when I realized you couldn't loot bodies, but there is enough loot scattered throughout the map that adding full loot on kills would slow the game to a crawl. Shooting feels good, and there are a wide variety of firearms. Some are better than others, and some balancing is a little weird. An UMP-45 (SMG) takes two headshots to kill while a Colt 1911 (Literal starting pistol if you skip the tutorial) takes 1 despite being the same caliber. As of writing, there is no lean or crouch function, the former being slightly more odd of an omission than the latter because of how Tarkov-esque the firearm damage and healing system is. Some of the randomly generated maps can get repetitive, but the core gameplay loop is so addictive that it doesn't matter that much after awhile. Combat in this game is quick and deadly, and sometimes you're better off fleeing with your stuff than getting caught between waves of reinforcements. Still plenty of room for this game to grow, but for $7USD, this is an easy recommendation.",1

28409,"A fun little single player shooter that takes the inventory/economy management from an extraction shooter, and applies it to a mission based structure. You won't be getting huge open levels you can loot and 'quest' to your hearts content here, but much smaller, levels generated specifically around an objective, which you will have to complete before extracting. You can extract without the objective but you'll take a reputation hit, but sometimes its worth it if you're low on supplies and don't want to lose your gear.
The combat feels good enough, It's not the best shooter I've ever played mechanically but it does the job (what I wouldn't give for a lean function! or even just a crouch to better loot low items).
There's a nice bit of mission type variety, and the locations get more varied as you progress in the reputation system.
Overall, I definitely recommend, the game is fun in its current state, and there's room for it to get even better.

28410,"To play this game once is a simple task. To truly master this game is inherently a challenge.
This game has a surprisingly small community for how advanced it is as an indie game. There are its bugs here and there, but it's quite a decent interjection to the hellstorms of triple A titles we've gotten as of late [spoiler] (Hello MW3 players, are you excited for BO6?!) [/spoiler] and I'd honestly have paid more for this game if I knew I was going to enjoy it this much lol.

My advice for this game:
1) Add a demo, so people can try the game out before they buy it. [spoiler] you could use the intro section & one/two missions the player can do, with stuff like shops maybe cut out so people can't access them with external bypasses. [/spoiler]
2) Add more music. [spoiler] as far as I can tell, and from the point I've played up to, there's only really 2 music tracks that play in the background one after the other. To counteract this, you could have varying soundtracks for different sections of the ""lobby"" of the game (i.e.: soundtrack for being inside house; background noises for being just outside; soundtrack for being inside shopping mall; reduced/no background noise when inside train station - it'll usually be tense since people here will often be heading to their mission.) [/spoiler]
3) Add more flare to the lobby area. [spoiler] i feel it'd be beneficial if certain areas had more noticeable features to signify their importance, like the area you live in could have a few yellow posters around the place saying ""APARTMENTS FOR RENT"" etc. just so it stands out. even more so, though, you could... [/spoiler]
4) Add MORE to the lobby area. [spoiler] you could expand the area above ground, and have small restaurants selling more food items/drink items, etc. though i get why this feature may not be implemented, since the parts of the game where you're in the lobby area are usually at night, so they might be closed. [/spoiler]

This game is amazing, BUT it takes notes from being a rogue-like. If you don't like losing progress, don't play this game, or otherwise be prepared to turn into a ""full-time""-masochist.",1

Click on the places marked with a small golden triangle. There you can buy things, take orders.
Always check the book in the upper left corner of the screen when you select an order. There you can see what you need to complete the order.
1) Finish the ladder and the door orders.
2) Buy the owl feathers and the leather belt.
3) Complete the bow order, buy the horns.
4) Look at the axe order - get a message that you need to upgrade your forge. Go to your house/forge. Upgrade the forge. Put the Grinding Stone in a vacant slot in the forge.
5) Go back and complete the axe order.
6) Buy the leather

Now you have a new location, new orders, etc. You can always repeat an order if you failed to fulfill it. All materials regenerate, you don't need to restock or buy again. There are repeatable orders in the game, so you can earn money as much as you want. These are marked with a double box. You'll find them when you complete the Tavern location. Use the ""Help"" menu to read tips on each of the tools.

28425,"The interface is a bit janky. The audio balancing is wacky at times - my cats got scared when an audio sample of ""angry cat meowing"" blasted at full volume, disproportionately louder than music or other sounds. The rare voiceovers are done using text-to-speech, and not of the latest advanced interations clearly. The turorial is overbearing, so I skipped it after a while and started a new game without it. Fortunately it wasn't too difficult to figure out what to do. The game could use some minor polish here and there.

HOWEVER! Despite all that, [b]I'm absolutely loving[/b] the gameplay! It's probably one of the best blacksmith games out there, with the focus on making items, rather than managing the forge or economics.
This is more of a puzzle game, where players have to use various tools and materials to assemble an item as close to the blueprint as possible. You can saw wood or bone, hammer and bend metals into various shapes, use sharpening stone, pin components together, add ropes, leather straps, belts, buckles, spikes and many many more things and available tools.
Progressing through the story unlocks new unique orders with gradually increasing complexity, which in turn does a great job at teaching the player new techniques that will come in handy later.

My first axe that I made was a real piece of garbage. It looked hilariously bad. But over time I became better at hammering metals into shapes that I want. And it's SOOOO satisfying to complete an order with 99% accuracy!

If you like involved gameplay that consists of meticulous tinkering, measuring and experimenting - Blacksmith Song of two Kings will be right up your valley!",1

28427,"Blacksmith. Song of two Kings is a unique blacksmithing title and the answer is yes, I'm the best blacksmith this side of town.

Since writing this review I'm 93 hours in and still thoroughly enjoying it. I play it on and off, and it's also super great if multitasking to background audio or listening to your gf. Nonetheless, it's still a difficult game to master and I had to look the game creator's owl blacksmith video to get some tips. Originally, I thought it was only about shaping items, but the game, strangely enough, has a lot more going for it than I originally thought. As the best blacksmith in town, I need to manage what tools I will take to the smithy with me, what guests can stay at the house (to help improve the business and/or smithing) and what current items and bonuses to use as well, which supplement guests (each with their own story) and their relative items. It doesn't just end there. There's a progression system, an interesting story, a map with fog of war, and gold to earn for your business (upgrading the buildings, buying materials and taking on certain jobs). Later, there's magic and morality (like cursed/blessed properties) you can later imbue in your craft with the help of guest witches and necromancers. Yes, being a good blacksmith requires a whole range of skills.

I cannot find much fault to the game, but it does have its own set of problems. However, the art style and crafting physics are really enjoyable, so for me they are easily overlooked. I thoroughly recommend Blacksmith. Song of two Kings to anyone who enjoys a bit of a challenge but at their own pace and to people who really appreciate this kind of immersive art style, and especially to those blacksmiths that have a talkative partner. Currently at 93 hours and judging by the map, I think I have another 30-40 hours before I complete the campaign.

[h2]PROs[/h2] 

+ Fantastic art - everything is drawn
+ satisfying skill based crafting system, especially the shaping of metal
+ Great music and atmospheric sounds
+ Intriguing and indepth story, even though I was not too interested
+ House, item management and business management of blacksmithing
+ Allows for creativity to solve many problems
+ Take your time and relax
+ You can cheese the % recognition marker for crafting of items (sometimes makes unnecessarily difficult items easier to craft) 
+ Great and quick support from the creator of the game with any help, including bugs
+ Tons of jobs, and many repeatable jobs
+ High difficulty - without thorough preparation for the material the order needs, you may need to restart or make the item again later and many jobs have extra optional requirements for extra rewards
+ Fantastic crafting effects, especially the magical side

[h2]CONs[/h2]

- Since everything is drawn, cutting and shaping materials can cause the item to lose its depth so it does not look as good anymore
- Overly stretching and bending metal can cause some odd properties 
- Items are not built for utility or practicality but rather to complete certain criteria (-immersion)
- You can cheese the % recognition marker for crafting of items (- immersion) 
- Occasional bugs
- Low replayability
- All information needed is available in-game but initially knowing where to look is sometimes unclear

Very buggy, EXTREMELY FINNICKY. You spend more time lining things up than actually crafting, it honestly seems easier to do a lot of this stuff IRL than with these controls.

The items I make end up looking as crap as it would if I tried actual blacksmithing.
It's sort of annoying and intriguing at the same time.

The difficulty I'm playing on is apprentice (I shudder to think how difficult it would be on Master difficulty). I really wish and hope that the Devs would consider bringing in ""Total Noob"" difficulty and add guides or self-correcting hammers, or maybe an 'undo' button... ? Pretty please Devs... 

I absolutely love the concept and relaxed pace of the game.

This game really allows you to express pride in your work: sure, you can trick that little number in the corner into thinking you did a good job, but when the time comes to hand it in and you're forced to look at the misshapen monstrosity you created, it really does make you feel a little guilty for not trying a bit harder.

28440,"The game is not perfect. The execution can be improved, especially the UI and the controls. It needs A LOT of QOL changes (can I have zoom please?). Regardless, I love it. I believe there is no other crafting/ smithing game with this approach. 

I'm really bad with my hands (I blame my lack of dexterity) but I love crafting and tinkering in real life. This game reflects that accurately - as what I craft looks very bad or I spend too much time in one craft just to make it acceptable. LOL. But that's the beauty of it. I've been pretty stressed lately and going to the forge late at night helps me relax and unwind.

I recommend the game because I wanted to support its development. Despite being a ""finished"" game, it lacks polishing and can sometimes feel like Early Access. Regardless, I wanted others to try the DEMO first and judge the game for itself. I believe it will be a lot better after a few updates.

I often find at the end of the creation process, that I've missed something. And thus I am required to abandon my work and start again.",0
28444,"Loved the game, pretty fun

Especially liked the part where it crashed, sent me back roughly 30 minutes in progress, crashed again while I was redoing the candle stand two times in a row and now I'm too scared to open it up again because I have 6 minutes left before being able to refund it.",1
28445,"The controls are a disaster (can't see all items in inventory), and the tutorial dos not teach you anything (click here, click that).",0
28446,"So this is really fun.

I'm using legit blacksmithing techniques to solve real blacksmithing problems. Like, how do I get an even curve on a metal rod? A vice, a hammer, consistency and patience.

This ain't cooking mama. You're mostly using the same raw materials and the same tools to make different objects, which is the most 'feels like crafting' experience I've had in a game. And, like, games that try to simulate crafting are my entire jam.

The 'overworld' 'you are running a shop' economic sim part is barely there, but just there *enough* to make me feel like I'm playing a crafting game, not a puzzle game, if that makes sense. Very welcome, very good use of limited dev resources.

The whole project is really tightly put together, gorgeous, small-but-with-a-lot-of-gameplay, and does a unique physicsy thing, reminding me of Hammerfight by Konstantin Koshutin.",1
28447,"I see quite a few comments talking about how bad the physics and control can be. 

That's true, honestly. Like a tool meant to let you bend metal where the metal can easily get stuck in it. That's been a fairly minor irritant so far though, as have all the others. It's sometimes incredibly hard to get metal in the shape you want it, also, in extreme cases to the point of feeling impossible.

But then, I didn't come here for perfection, I came here for Swinging Hammer. And let me tell ya if you're as obsessed with smithing as I am, this is a good one. Annoyances or no, it does capture the feeling of carefully hammering something out, carving, nailing, etc, and there's satisfaction in getting something that [i]looks good[/i]. Take some time, get used to the controls. It mostly became second nature to me after the first half hour or so, and by that point I'd forgotten I had only intended to give it a quick try before switching to another game. So yes, I recommend.",1
28448,"Do you enjoy messing with unintuitive controls? Do you like QWOP? Because if QWOP made a blacksmithing game, it'd probably be a lot like this. Trying to line things up to bend in this game is ridiculous. The hammer rotation mechanics are awful as you try to angle it just right in this 2D environment where you bump into everything. And then when you try to clamp onto the anvil, it gets jammed and you can't use the horn to bend your metal at all. A great concept, but overall incredibly frustrating controls.",0
28449,"While this game is far from perfect, it does more than many other similar item creation games manage: actually creating the items yourself.
Most crafting mechanics require you to simply gather the raw materials into a single area and then it becomes a predefined shape. I never really feel satisfied with these sorts of mechanics because I don't have any control over what the result actually looks like.
In this game, you need to actually deform and arrange the raw materials into the shape you need, and it's the deformation forging that really got me hooked. You can customize an order to look how you would like it, and there's even a ""free play"" option to make literally anything.
My only real complaint is that it sounds like voice acting (there's not a lot of it, but it's there sometimes) is AI generated, but it looks like this is just one single person's passion project, so from one indie game dev to another I understand why.",1
28450,"Developer is fairly responsive and pays attention to the bugs and issues. So thats a major plus already.

The game is kinda a puzzle crafting game where you have to do your best to work out how to move metal with the tools you have on a 2D plane, which can be conceptually difficult until you practice a bit.
The controls can be a bit janky and it absolutely feels like its been designed to play on a tablet, which is not a negative in itself, but does lend itself as a reason to the odd controls.

I have almost 11 hours on record so far and will be continuing to play through as its probably the best crafting game, and singularly best blacksmithing game, I have ever played.

If you are into blacksmithing and medieval craft, this game is a must buy",1
28451,"I think I've encountered a numerical glitch in the game. On the first project to do for the thugs in the northeast part of the kingdom to the northeast, it requires a pretty simple dagger to be made. However when I go to select the order its saying I have to pay 99650 gold as a fee in order to take it on. Has anyone else had this issue?",1
28452,"Just not good enough physics mechanics for the game, materials constantly getting stuck on objects that are supposed to be used together. Unclear instructions from tutorial also.",0
28453,"Really cool game with cool mechanics.

The start is a bit rough and could be more streamlined. 

Else its pretty cool",1
28454,"6e... that s the appropriate price for that game in this current state.
It s an early access at best, with bad audio. 

I played the demo for about 6h, so that s my review after 13h of gameplay.
DON'T BUY.

--- for more details ---
When I played this game, what was passing through my mind was ""I m sure it would be easier to do it in real life..."" (then that's this game offers).
- The space where I crafted was cramped. It s difficult to move things around without hitting other pieces.
- You have the list of materials needed for the recipe only before crafting, never during.
- You have no way to trace the schematics on your plank of woods. So cutting angles on planks is a nigthmare.
- You have no way to mark a line on iron. So making angles at the right spot is a guessing game.
- The rail on the grinding wheel can be adjusted, but not horizontally. Moving a piece through the rail to have a straight edge is unecessary difficult.

The voices have static. All of them. And it s an AI reading a script monotously.

Otherwise the game has good art, the story was okay and the world building was actually really nice.
I would have enjoyed discovering more of this imaginary world if it wasn t such a chore.

Complete.",0
28455,"Great game about forging, but to be almost perfect it would need some UI/UX quality life improvements: 
-When choosing what items to bring, the highlighted items are almost identical as the non highlighted
-Once you are in the forge, you dont know exactly what items you need to use to forge, so for example you dont know if the base of a weapon is a wood or metal base
-When created an intermediate item, it stays there, you can't store it for later, so it can be annoying because it collides with the other collider items and tools
-If you make a big mistake and add something by error to a weapon (which hapenned to me), you can't undo it, so it could cause you to fail and you would need to restart everything again, frustrating
-Ropes physics are frustrating too, sometimes they go crazy
-...",0
28456,way to many glitches literally had to retry a level 5 time cuz the protection was to low even tho i did everything right. and you can so easily get soft locked cuz you spent your money on the wrong things and you cant do any contracts because they cost to much,0
28457,"Has it's quirks. Control of the hammer could be better, but skill comes with practice. The only way to save the game is to exit via the menu, so I've lost progress before assuming that there was an autosave and Alt+F4ing. Sometimes the ingots get a bit wonky if worked too much. BUT, it's also the best blacksmithing game I've played thus far. Hope the dev sees this as positive encouragement to keep plugging away at projects like this.",1
28458,"No this isn't blacksmithing, you lightly tap one side of a metal and the entire things spreads in all sides. 
This is not blacksmith ""Simulator"", this is instead ""spread texture"" simulator. 
Refunding, didn't expect to get stressed from a thing I actually enjoy irl.",0
28459,"Great therapeutic blacksmithing game! Start out crafting ladders and tavern signs, work you way up to magical artifacts for the kingdom's greatest knights, and have a lot of fun the whole time! While some interface elements could use some refining, the crafting is mostly intuitive and satisfying. Highly recommended if the premise appeals to you!",1
28460,"Great game! After finding your way to use the controls, it`s a relaxing crafting game. 
Please let us keep as many pictures as we want in our gallery!",1
28461,"The new game of Blacksmith: Song of two Kings has positively surprised me. 
The gaming process is captivating from the very first minute. What particularly pleased me was the tutorial ‚Äì straightforward yet detailed, without unnecessary information.
The game immediately draws you in. The thrill of completing each task is great. You can feel the difficulty level increasing, but it only adds to the game's excitement. The satisfaction from each stage completed is gripping, urging you to tackle more challenging tasks. You immerse yourself in it and lose track of time.
Blacksmith: Song of two Kings has the potential to be one of those games that linger in your memory. I recommend it to everyone who appreciates quality gaming. Even veterans in this genre will find much fun. 
",1
28462,"Clearly started out as a mobile game. Does not work great on PC.
Materials disappear if you can even access them",0
28463,"I am not one to comment on games but I feel like this dev deserves it! 
This is one incredible little big game. Extremely cozy but at the same it gets me hooked with the story bits and overall world. The forge system takes a while to understand and get the hang of, but once you do it's very magical. So far I have been having a blast albeit not having much time to play. And the developer is very kind listening to the community's opinion. 
Be prepared to learn how to bend metal, cut wood in circles and all that. But one nice thing is that you can always do some workarounds and still make it work. For example, I failed in bending a metal so I cut in 3 shapes, fixed them all and still got 100% accuracy (since the shape was there I just used 3 more screws), which I really like : )
If you want a true blacksmith simulator, with nice physics and all the mechanics I truly recommend this game. 
So far my only gripe is the screw animation could be a little bit faster (maybe there is an upgrade in the game which I still haven't found).
Edit: yes there is a way to speed it up haha (now I am getting destroyed by the curved daggers)",1
28464,good but saws are a bit janky but still pretty good,1
28465,First blacksmithing game I have found that feels like an actual blacksmithing game.,1
28466,One of the best carpal tunnel simulator I've ever played,1
28467,"I am thoroughly enjoying this game.
Yeah, the interface and the controls can get quirky at times, like with every physics-based games, but nothing game breaking.
The gameplay is very unique and the story mode is very well put together and has a nice addictive reward loop going (fulfil crafting order > make money > buy advanced crafting tools and components > upgrade your forge > fulfil more complex order > etc etc).
I grabbed this on sale but it is easily worth the full price!",1
28468,I found this game by accident but it is just a really fun crafting simulator??? It has a similar vibe to potioncraft in that when you work out the best way of doing things it feels rewarding. There is a story and plot too but the crafting is definitely the focal point. I've been treating it as a game to pop into when I need some chill time and it's great.,1
28469,i really like the game... but it is a bit Overpriced for what it is..,1
28470,"This game really does give you a satisfying blacksmith experience with a fun variety of orders to complete. I recommend anyone interested even a little to give the demo a try like I had, your progress in the demo will transfer into the full game. I was hooked after the 3rd order and all progress was still there and I was even prepared to start over if need be. Finding creative ways to fulfill the orders and problem solving builds truly feels like becoming a more competent blacksmith and I found myself developing my own work flow, where it once took many tens of minutes to finish a meager knife I was now pounding out flawless longswords in 15 minutes with little to no hick-ups.

Only complaint I have is a minor one that is a non-issue to me because I tend to watch videos while I play games would be the voice lines from the companions and the soundtrack. Companion lines sound like they came off an old floppy disc point click adventure from the 90's, like come on you can find door bells with better recording quality. Soundtrack I found to be alright for all of the 3 minutes it didn't feel like a loop. 

Everything else about the game I can say I enjoy or at least see the reasoning behind, easy recommendation to anyone who likes to get creative and enjoys challenging themselves to develop strategies.",1
28471,Awesome with more songs! Looking forward to more releases ^^,1
28472,Good songs. Would buy more.,1
28473,"Neat little physics game with mind-boggling controls. Description is apt: easy to learn hard to master. Similar to other rage games, prepare to have your progress destroyed due to your own incompetence.

It's fun! Worth the purchase.",1

28490,"Absolutely love this game, it is such a simple concept yet I adore the storyline and of course my little bucket-headed fairy friend. The little puzzles and challenges do really well at breaking up the slight monotony of building and crafting. If there was anything to critique, I would only say that the change of music when the fairy runs is a bit sudden, however I do still love the change in music.
Definitely would recommend giving this game a try!!",1
28491,"For a free demo I will say this was a lot of fun and the progression feels rewarding while also adding to the challenge of having to travel further out from the tree in the middle. 
The physics are a fun addition and adds a lot to the aesthetic, however this does have you tripping over every residual rock and tree root left from mining/cutting trees.

Overall a positive experience, I only wish there was a way of marking each 'island' with a resource symbol or note, as after you mine an area its quite hard to remember what resource was there after clearing it.

While the water totem is a nice additional extra, it would be nice if you could manually regrow a resource with an item like a watering can, as often I found myself waiting for yellow flowers to grow (with the water totem) just to make fuel for the resource replenishing fire to make some progression.

9/10 would recommend

28522,"Cool units, the grind is very long and hard so the pack is worth it imo.

How collectibles work:
I thought I lost 2 of my e8 shermans but turns out if you assign them to one regiment, you cannot assign them to another. So with that in mind I had put 2 of them into my 1st tank regiment, moved onto the medium regiment and thought they were 'consumed'. They are not consumable they are permanent, and you can buy as many as you want with supplies earned in game in order to spread them across multiple regiments, they are also not overpowered as they are just reskins of default vehicles like the regular e8. That said the flamethrower sherman is pretty cool and good for anti-infantry would recommend unlocking that fairly quickly.

Wish there was somewhere that actually gave you the full rundown of how collectibles work but trial and error is fine ;)",1

28533,"the fear when you hear a sonar ping then the splash of a depth charge

28534,"Despite being a VR to PC port, this is probably the best way you could do it. Controls feel responsive, it's challenging but not annoying, immersive but not pretentious. All-in-all a very terrifying fun experience.

Oh and of course for those who have seen the movie ""Das Boot"" this is a dream come true.",1
28535,"In my short time playing and lack of people to play with (and horrible internet connection reliability overall), I've rather enjoyed myself in this desktop experience and am strongly considering grabbing the main game for use in VR, and outside of VR. I've turned on all the assists and was still left with the challenge of not tunneling on one task and overall navigating the submarine through minefield peppered waters. Don't think I'll be getting the gold medals very often, but managing to multi-task the submarine into a silver or even bronze time is still a feel-good moment. I especially like how there's no geometry involved in making torpedo runs and that the gunnery is very intuitive even outside VR, just straightforward tasks to be done.

I have had a mild gripe on the mouse interaction in regards to fast-acting with gunnery though, I'll stand myself off to the ""corner"" so as to have quick access to shells and quick load them into the gun and pull the trigger, all in one semi-smooth operation. The gripe comes in where sometimes the little green status/menu screen will sometimes overlap with the trigger depending on where I'm standing, but this is largely resolved with just changing up position a little bit and carrying on.

Another small thing is that I don't believe the sonar station or the hydroplanes have been covered in the tutorial, nor any mention of the player having a compass, spyglass, or little map/speed/depth tool in their inventory spheres, but I was able to quickly figure those out. I do especially like the little pocket chart that gives quick orders for surface/periscope depths, speeds, and being able to pick out a direction. Functionally I could sit in the weapons station, check the hydrophones for a quick scan for targets, peek up with periscope, adjust course, manage torpedo locks, all in one convenient location and makes singleplayer usage quite a bit more smooth.

Noteable experience: I did get tunnel vision in sinking merchants in mission 3 and have ran into a mine which caused three leaks whilst I was at periscope depth, I was in the weapons room at the time where all the leaks were. I went to the helm, set the hydroplanes to full ascend, went back to the other room and welded a leak shut. Realizing stopping would be a good idea to prevent another mine hit, I went back to helm to stop/slow the sub before going back to fix the other two leaks. As I was putting the welder away in my room traversals, I noticed an odd toolbox-looking object in one of my inventories, checking it out and discovering that it was the aforementioned map/control thing. Wound up finishing the mission, took about 14 minutes to get done as I was navigating mines and running subsurface to avoid planes, but will definitely have to give it some more goes later on.

Overall, yeah I'm gonna put the main game on the wishlist. Cheers~",1
28536,"very good for a free game and super fun with friends, might need some time getting used to realistic controls tho",1
28537,"I enjoy this game, i think it's very nice. I was playing with my friends for the 3 hours i have played so far.
In multiplayer, when beginning a new mission there's an annoying bug though: when someone is talking while the mission  starts it will replay around 1 second of their speech until the game loads example: ''yeah about tha- (about tha-, about tha-, about tha-, about tha-''
Otherwise i can't complain about the quality",1
28538,"Tested (87 minutes)
Error in 4th Tutorial, control is removed of levers and switches blocking completion. 

Free Non VR
Playable but non intuitive interface
Pressing and holding F to interact and then rotation to actuate where a point and click on mouse  should suffice.
Having to keep turning wheels where 100% turn of open or closed is only option instead of intuitive one click smooth operation.
Having to run between rooms to perform actions. It is not a one man sub but game treats it as such. An Order menu should be in place, more so for for when assist is on. 
IEs, Orders,
Set to periscope depth, sets to periscope optimum depth.
Set Depth, and option to select depth.
Evasive Maneuvers, orders random speed and course changes.
Surface, and emergency surface.
Dive, and emergency dive.
Silent Running
Speed changes
Hydrophone Report

To be precise, there is a lack of functionality. The assist features should always be on, and the captain should be able to take specific command as an option, no as the rule. Someone manning the hydrophone, someone on the helm, able to complete given orders. Running into next room to check hydrophone and then back change course is crippling.

Cold Waters could take a lesson from Iron Wolf in sub controls, but Iron Wolf could take a lesson from Cold waters in user Interface and commands.
Cold Waters gives ability to see targets that could not otherwise be seen, a failure on their part as that is not how subs work. This is not a review of Cold Waters though.
Iron Wolf allows a mostly submerged sub to man deck guns and fire while gun is covered in water, that should be fixed.

I see no way to identify targets by sound of visual other than to look for deck guns. Did not encounter enemy subs. 

Maybe the non free version is better but this is not a bad review. While the interface and how one has to manipulate it is lacking in my opinion, Iron Wolf does a fine job of Sub control and Mechanics. As one reviewer put it, it was an exciting time of seeing nothing. That is submarine combat. A tactical solution in a graphical void.",1
28539,Me and my 2 vegetable friends got qualified to pilot a submarine (we have 30 minutes of experience).,1
28540,"While the game does function well enough, it is still a far better option to opt for the VR option. The only reason I would recommend the game would be more of a ""demo"" as to what features would be available in VR. 

The other issue between the games is the speed at which different actions occur. The locomotion of actions, such as loading torpedoes manually, are vastly different in speed. Additionally, the interactions measures often are difficult to manage between adjacent ones. For example: Opening a latch on a door vs pulling on the door are often difficult to differentiate. 

However, the true negative to the game is the lack of free-roam. This is the real bread and butter of the game, and is a key piece missing in the current form. While my opinion might improve slightly if it were added, I would still only suggest getting the game as more of a test/demo. 

The other point to consider is the online community for the game. While the game is clearly meant to be enjoyed with multiple people, you will often find it to be rather ""empty"". While the Non-VR game is new, the VR counterpart is not. Both have, at best, a fledgling online community, making multiplayer a rare encounter. Unless you have friends joining to play, I would caution expectations on that regard, instead viewing it more a solo-game.",1
28541,"very good free game, did not actually find any major bugs, only bugs were that i could not play the guides because  of jank but the actual game works just fine.

very nice free expirence.",1
28542,"The destroyer stage is hard but beat-able, it was a hard fight but i got through it neitherless by firing torps randomly. Have these things on to help you 1-Auto Torpedo Reload 2- Auto Pump 3-Alarms",1
28543,"this game is a master piece it is fun  that's why i recommend it   
as a free game this is legendary as it provides immersive controls  and experience that can keep you on the edge of your seat.  
1) yes the controls are a bit janky but its a great transformation of a game which was meant for vr but they are quite simple 
2)the game is a bit difficult for some missions as expected 
3)the game is very playable  with its easy controls
4)the graphics quality is good  
these are some of the reasons that make this game worth it as it also serves as a prologue for the other version but this is no prologue its a cut down version of the real game and will still work just fine",1
28544,"Haven't played with friends yet but I imagine it's more fun

Alright on Single Player",1
28545,"This game is surprisingly fun, with realistic gameplay and such, even supporting VR! My buddy and I met this VR player whose name I think is ‚ÄúColota‚Äù or something like that, he was super chill and we just made him the captain of our submarine for the game until we had to leave. Mr captain man, can we add you?",1
28546,"It's a simple enough game run a German submarine with your friends while hunting an allied convey, what could possibly go wrong?, get your crew together and Dive comrades it's time to create Das Boot only with people who have no clue what they're doing, a genuinely super fun game to play with your mates.",1
28547,Its fun exciting and its great with friends... I'm really into the history of WW2 and the Atlantic shipping route is a big part of that so of course !'m interested in U-BOATS!! all I need for this game to be a 10 / 10 would be to Have something more obvious for a voice chat button... I'm still not clear on how to talk to others in the game... i have bought the VR version because of the free version,1
28548,"A fun game, the mechanics are odd to learn but as soon as you get a grasp on it best ride ever, especially get one friend or two and you have a functioning team.
Recommend having auto assist for pumping otherwise the sub is your oyster.",1
28549,"Fun little game. A quality that I did not expect for a free game. Surprisingly sophisticated if you play without AI help (which you can if you have less than the 4 recommended party members). Slightly monotonous (basically just find target, lock torpedo, shoot, reload, repeat) but ig it would be fun with friends (I wouldn't know).",1
28550,"Let me tell you the tale of the phantom wheel. As the designated driver of the sub (only one not high or something), I quickly fell victim to the ghoulish apparition known only as ""THE PHANTOM WHEEL."" This bastard loves to steer you into mines or mess up your friends torpedo shots, but only does so in moments of absolute chaos.

I know it's a glitch, but this shit so funny that we found ourselves cursing the phantom wheel and laughing every time it happened.

8.7/9.2 - Should have had more ghosts.",1
28551,"vary hard, fine graphics, very nice macanics 7/10",1
28552,game is really fun may seem complicated but you'll learn fast play the tutorials there are 4 for every room and repairing don't lookup videos you don't need to just play the game with friend or friends and have fun 10/10,1
28553,"A cool game to play together with your friends! 
Me and my friend both dont have a VR but the game is already very fun without! The game is pretty complicated at first but we just pulled every lever till the prblem was solved and tried to remember which lever is for what. 
I say download the game and have a few fun nights with your friends!
...I mean what do you have to lose th game is free.",1
28554,"the game is so hard its incredible, like im shooting 10 times or more on a ship and it doesnt care at all and those ships are on godmode the whole time like they know any time anywhere where we are and knows exacly what to do.",0
28555,"its is very entertaining to play, especially when you do it with friends and when you don't do the tutorial. Its more fun to figure it out as you go.",1
28556,"Played through the tutorial and the first mission by myself. Looks to be a good 'tank killer' game of eld with plenty of chaos for a group and level headed strategy for solo.

Cons at time of review:
‚Ä¢ Can't Crouch. Apparently you can, but there is no keybindings config at all.
‚Ä¢ No idea if I saved my progress or not. After completing the first mission I saw nothing posted on the lobby leaderboard, and there was zero way to exit the game from within the game; thus forcing me to close via alt+tab into Steam.

Something to note: in the tutorial while learning the fuse box, you might softlock yourself. Fuses are able to be messed with and blow the lights prematurely. You can progress if you happen to be in the right spot, otherwise it is better to restart rather than mouse around in the dark before your Torch (t key) is available.

I also recommend high dpi if you can. I set my sensitivity to max on an old 2012 Naga and could still only slowly move things  sometimes. Make ample use of key inputs for the periscope.",1
28557,"very fun! playing w/ your friends and cooperating in stressful situations and coming up on top always feels amazing
would like for the tutorials to be worked on a little though",1
28558,"sea of thieves but good

In all seriousness, I love the way you interact with the ship - it feels like a point-and-click game except for the fact you can walk around and I LOVE IT. It feels much more realistic than any game of similar nature to this.

8/10 would appreciate a paid non-VR version with more content",1
28559,the experience of being in a old submarine  with little protection and the only defence is your strategy i love this it makes you and your friends put all there strength to survive i love this keep making more like this,1
28560,"U Need to get this, Best Testing Before getting real thing, i enjoyied the Intense Level of Stress and teamworks with late missions
Treu Graphics aint great but its Awesome Content",1
28561,"Great game! I like it a lot quite simple design, anybody can play and I might even get the VR version because it provides great gameplay.",1
28562,"This game looks crude, basic and primitive. The missions are not inspiring, the game mechanics cannot compete to anything I know.
If you play it with your friends it unfolds a surprising amount of fun though. Cooperate and become a team or drown! Simple as that. Find out if you are U-Boat material. But do try out the demo first.",1
28563,"This game is the final boss of sim games. If you're playing in non-vr you're gonna have a slightly easier time than your buddy who's stuck in vr trying to load the damn torpedoes. All in all, an A+ game. Way more fun if you've got a full crew of four.",1
28564,This is a great game about you being in a submarine it has realistic control in it and i would highly recommend this to everyone! But the trailer music is a bit weird.,1
28565,"I was not going to buy this due to not having any VR equipment. But, after trying the free non-VR edition, and the VR copy can be played without any VR tools, I‚Äôm hooked. Good call on making it free (like a demo). Adding another sub game to the library.  Thanks!",1
28566,fun simulator vr controls for keyboard and mouse are good wish it had the free roam mode but makes sense why it isn't available it does have all the missions  the vr version has,1
28567,I Greatly Enjoy this game. It might not have the best graphics but thats becasue of the fact its VR capable.,1
28568,the phisics a pretty good and a good portion of missions. took me a while to find out we are nazi's or japanese. just look at the planes going down close to you.,1
28569,"The AI is kinda BS rn and needs fixing
The destroyers know your location at all times basically even though you weren't detected yet unless you haven't fired a shot
Depth charges are also kinda bs
Other than that the game could be fun
Sadly it's ""Could"" for now",0
28570,"This Game is awesome, seriously once you figure everything out its a ton of fun. By yourself with assists if needed or with friends. Your going to have a good time with this! Not to mention the whole game is free and what I mean by that is. All of the missions are unlocked for you to play and it even has a procedural mission for infinite replayability for the last mission. enjoy and good luck!",1
28571,"I played a public match and i couldnt even communicate with the other players, no way to communicate, there arent any keybind options.",0
28572,"A really cool game if you take time to understand it
  
Un jeu vraiment cool si vous prenez le temps de le comprendre",1
28573,"Der m√§chtigste K√∂nig im Luftrevier simulator
Best submarine game I've ever seen, no motion sick.


It also enhances my inner Kriegsmarine :)",1
28574,"Elements from the VR version don't translate great, like very hard to see inventory slots in dark environments. The tutorials are mostly fine but sometimes lack important distinctions and sometimes give incorrect information. For example the periscope actually uses the inputs W/S to move it up/down, while moving the mouse forward/backward zooms it in/out. The actual gameplay is fine for the most part, but not entertaining as a single-player experience.",0
28575,Its a lot like Sid Meier's game Silent Service (1985). Both are good games. Isn't open world like silent service though :(,1
28576,"i yelled alarm at my crew and panicked and got blown up by barrels of TNT

10/10 Best co-op game with your friends",1
28577,Very good but super hard. Me and me has exploded the sub at least 6 times and we have blown up so many innocent merchant ships.,1

28579,Fantastic graphics and very addictive.,1
28580,"me and the boys were playing level 5 and i was up on deck. i saw the destroyer turning sharply, i thought it was listing from my constant deck-cannon rounds. every time it turned i yelled ""GUYS ITS LISTING ITS LISTING""
only right before we sunk i got the thought that it was just turning, 10/10 game",1

28582,"Pretty sure you guys still working on the game,The character that display on your right screen just a live 2d, doesn't have any reaction when the character took damage and cloth don't being rip apart while the HP is half or lower.

Overall, The game still chibily cute and fun",1
28583,"Not the worst game I've ever played but it feels unfinished.

'Range' power-ups actually upgrade the projectile scale.
'Projectile count' doesn't affect most weapons.
The black sword doesn't seem to do anything.

You need to play 30 games to unlock all 6 scenes, but I got bored after about 7 games.",0

Default controls can't be switched and ass.
No options for different screen resolutions windowed mode

 Not worth it even on sale. Buy another porn game for now.",0
28585,"Marionette Eden Breakers? A Mixed Fantasy Adventure with Sensual Twists! (‡∏Ö'œâ'‡∏Ö)

[h1][b][1] Intro : [/b][/h1]

Marionette Eden Breakers is a hack-and-slash action title revolves around the premise of defeating monsters to become more powerful, a concept that initially piques interest. As you progress, you can acquire a variety of weapons, and the more monsters you vanquish, the more powerful your arsenal becomes, enabling you to deliver overwhelming attacks. Additionally, the inclusion of H-animations adds a unique aspect to the game, catering to a specific niche.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience : [/b][/h1]

However, the game is not without its shortcomings. Some players have voiced their disappointment in the lack of a compelling narrative, as Marionette Eden Breakers seems to lean heavily on its predecessor, Marionette Eden. Furthermore, the H-scenes, a significant selling point for some players, are notably brief and lack voiceovers, detracting from their impact. The battles themselves have also come under scrutiny, with some players finding them less engaging than the standards typically seen in the hack-and-slash genre.

One aspect that particularly stands out as a drawback is the absence of character reactions during battles. Players have noted that clothing doesn't sustain damage, and there's a lack of representation of the characters' struggles as their health depletes, which ultimately impacts the game's immersion.

[h1][b][3] Verdict : [/b][/h1]

In summary, Marionette Eden Breakers offers an interesting mix of action and adult content, but it falls short in some critical areas. While the concept of powering up through monster-slaying and the inclusion of H-animations have their merits, the underwhelming narrative, uninspiring battles, and short H-scenes without voiceovers leave room for improvement. Gamers seeking a more fulfilling hack-and-slash experience may find more satisfying options elsewhere. However, those interested in a unique combination of cute heroines and adult content at an affordable price might still discover something to enjoy in Marionette Eden Breakers.

28593,"This game is overflowing with personality and that unique Sui Arts touch!
If you haven't played his older games you might be a little surprised though. The game doesn't take itself very seriously and there's lots of fourth wall-breaking (the game even points out that the joke is getting overused in the beginning). If you don't enjoy the humor, you're probably not going to enjoy your time with the game.
However, I do recommend that everyone at least tries the game. There's a free demo, so nothing will be lost if you don't like it. You're not going to experience anything like this anywhere else (except in Sui Arts other games then obviously).
But I'll keep following Sui Arts and I'm already looking forward to the next episode. Keep up the good work!

[strike]The only thing I can see as a negative is that this is very obviously a mobile-first kind of game and that includes the big on-screen buttons. It would be nice to have a setting that removes some of those (for example the interact button in the bottom right) so it looks closer to a game made for the computer. It's obvously not needed and doesn't change how good this game is, but it would be nice to at have the option there. [/strike]
(Edit: The amazing developer listened and updated the game, so you can now hide the buttons through the settings)

The game is also released on Google Play and Apples App Store. I‚Äôve played his other games on mobile and only bought this on Steam so that I could enjoy the new pixel-art on a bigger screen.

In short: Buy this and when you've played this, play all other Sui Arts games if you haven't already.",1

Finished every world and 4 extra levels in World 5 (marked as 6, 7, 8 and 9th level). These extra levels are extra hard, but managable. I recommend upgrading hero speed for those extra levels, you can find the upgrade in the main menu (requires gold though). Thank you for the game!",1

28604,"We DIDN'T PAY for a game that offered a specific experience. The product we got for has been irreversibly changed to the point it's no longer even the same game. Of course we're going to be upset about it. We were promised - and delivered -  a game that has tons of features including many worlds, unique monsters, shops and even many party modes. It includes survival mode, you can play alone or you can play with your friend. Get as many skins, profile pictures and make your profile as cool as possible.The difficulty of the game is medium. rather than the ""pay money to receive a meaningless skin"" experience the game has turned into, with each character becoming increasingly less unique and boring.

The community that entered the game from the beginning should not be forced to pay money for a few skins of the game they once loved in order to try and cobble together something that represents the game they were initially promised. DLCs should be a fun way to add extra content; not a poor and cheap way to make a quick buck.",0
28605,"Fruit Conflict is probably the most intense game you'll ever play. The action is non-stop and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the fruit characters are hilarious and fun. I'm totally addicted!‚Äç",1
28606,"Not recommended.

I like what this game wants to do. It's simple, avoid the dangers and collect the fruit. There is a lot of opportunity here, but it just feels like a prototype. The graphics are low grade and everything feels very generic. I was really disappointed in the jaggy movement animation. It's free, so go ahead and try if you must, but it needs a lot more work.",0

28610,"Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round because we've got a game on our hands that's not just great, it's paradigm-shifting, genre-defying, and a downright masterpiece. I mean, when I say it's one of the best of all time, you better believe I'm not blowing smoke.

Now, this game doesn't mess around when it comes to levels. Each one is a revelation, an experience that hits you like a ton of bricks. They're not just levels; they're immersive worlds, and every single one of them is a crucial piece of this gaming masterpiece. You might be wondering, ""Does it have any duds, any levels that make you question your life choices?"" Short answer: No! This game is in a league of its own.

Let's talk about the soundtrack for a moment. You know how Kendrick Lamar dropped ""To Pimp A Butterfly"" and Radiohead came through with ""OK Computer""? Well, move over because this game's OST is something else entirely. It's a musical journey that deserves more accolades than it already has. Hans Zimmer himself gave it a standing ovation, and for a good reason; this soundtrack is next level.

Now, we can't just ignore the visual feast this game serves up. The art direction and sprites? Immaculate! I heard they were crafted by every artist on Twitter ‚Äì and it shows. This game doesn't just look great; it's a visual spectacle that pushes the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

But hold on, there's more. The gameplay here is a revelation. Fruits changing locations ‚Äì I mean, come on! Who would've thought that gaming could take such a groundbreaking turn? It's innovation like this that makes you question if you've been living in a cave because no other game even comes close.

Graphics? Don't even get me started. This game's visuals are on a whole new plane of existence. They're so sharp and breathtaking that it feels like you're gazing into another dimension.

I could go on and on about this game, but let's cut to the chase. It's a 10/10, and you can bet your bottom dollar on it. This game isn't just great; it's a work of art, a testament to what the gaming industry can achieve when it dares to dream big. If you haven't played it yet, what are you even doing with your life?

also there is a game mechanic where chains become visible on your screen and freezes you in place randomly which is horrible and would be better as a visible trap or something not just randomly showing up out of the blue. having the ghost catch you means you have to find all 10 items again walking out of the house means you have to find all 10 items again so there is no point in trying if the dev is gonna make it this difficult",0

The game is still in alpha, so be mindful of changes or bugs (I haven't encountered any bugs yet). The game is fun, if you don't mind a bit of a grind and some learning curve. The dungeons are hard, but have all the ores necessary for progression. The puzzles aren't too complex (subject to change with harder dungeons), but give really good loot. There's always something to do, mine, gather, or kill. The character move speed is very slow in the beginning, but the level-ups give good stat boosts (towards the start, I put my points in speed and it made a big difference). Overall, the game is fun, a bit grindy, and I'm excited to see what kinds of other things the developers have in store for this game!",1
28657,pretty fun and silly project that was probably fun to make. the difficulty ramps up pretty quick and I think it would be more fun with an option to disable the 02 timer mechanic.

28663,"Compared to other rockstar games, the content seems rather lacking for the ""rock star life"".  The last big update devs spent a lot of time working on casino stuff - which does very little to flesh out the ""rock star life"", as I told the devs - adding things, all of us non-rock-stars can already do in real-life, does very little to create the ""rock star life"".

Makes me question the future of the tile.

Much work needs to be done and ON TOPIC to live up to it's own name.  Until they actually work on ""rock star life"" stuff, instead of ""random stuff life"" I can not recommend it - yet.  Hopefully, before dev is done, this will have changed.

28664,"This game is great fun.  I love a simulation game which uses skill trees, allows you to talk and build relationships with NPC's and is quite free roam.  It's fun that you can make your own decisions, explore and use your income to buy things.  I think the game is fair and balanced, meaning you don't have to grind to make enough money to progress.  Although I am a guitarist myself, I enjoy that the game isn't fully orientated around the guitar and also incorporates different aspects of the character's life.  I've put a few consecutive hours into this and am now at the point where I've played at most venues and have the most expensive clothes and cars.  I recently bought the studio which has allowed me to recruit more members into the band and to record music for other artists -  in this current version, the money earned from the studio doesn't seem like the best source of income and is also very difficult to achieve, however Rock Star Life Simulator is a free roam game and the studio is not something that you have to buy.  I think this is a great game and I am really looking forward to the future updates and what can be added next! Well done developers!",1
28665,"Rock Star Life Simulator has an interesting premise: start off as a nobody playing guitar on the street and work your way up to becoming a world famous rockstar. Unfortunately, the game's execution is so poor that it's almost unplayable.

The graphics are incredibly outdated, lacks of polish, and the gameplay is clunky and repetitive. There are also a number of bugs and glitches that make the game even more frustrating to play.

If you're looking for a fun and challenging rockstar simulator, I'm afraid Rock Star Life Simulator is not the game for you. However, if you're just looking for a laugh, you might get a kick out of how bad this game is.

Overall, I would not recommend Rock Star Life Simulator to anyone. There are much better games out there that you could be playing instead.",0

28667,"First and foremost, this game has the potential to be something truly unique and amazing! That being said, it's definitely far from finished and unpolished.

Pros:
-Starting from the bottom and working your way up is a fun concept.
- The AI chat system is absolutely amazing! It isn't perfect, but it works very well!
- The beginning progression is good.
- A lot of the initial concepts are intriguing.

Cons:
-Fighting feels like something just thrown in. Is very clunky and pointless.
-Same with as above when it comes to driving. Much easier and more efficient just to use the fast travel bus stops.
-Limiting the amount of chats with the AI really slows progression, especially since love is important to progression.
-Time goes by too fast when performing. A 6 song set can literally take over 10 in game hours and needs to be adjusted.

But I also found repairing guitars to make money very appropriate and creative. The biggest problem in the game is that the city is too big. My advice is that if you have money, choose to travel by bus, the first car is very slow :D It is a very successful game for the first version. Small note: The price may increase in the future. Because the game has a high potential for success.",1
28671,"I Really want to like this game.

Unfortunately, my dexterity is almost non-existent. The game needs to scale down the Guitar Hero button-pushing for those who just want to experience the game, but cannot handle the button requirement. 

Hopefully, since it is Early Access, the developer will work out a solution that lets people with physical disabilities enjoy the game.

{Crossing my fingers}

*****UPDATED 04/21/24*****

A huge shout out to the Dev, @cet, for responding to my original review and dumbing down the game for me.

The latest update allows you to set the difficulty for each song between normal and easy. This really helps a lot, as the easy mode allows you to advance when the dexterity challenge becomes too great. I currently have 6 songs written. The first 3 were easy to play on normal because it only required 2 fingers, but when it expanded to 3 fingers I was struggling. The 6th song required 4 and I was lost.",1
28672,"they have worked on every detail, Start your career as a street artist and climb the ladders to be a rockstar but you gotta work hard, You need money and as a street artist you dont earn much so you need extra jobs to get some cash.

Interactions with NPC's are great especially ""Flirting"" you must show what you got cuz there is an ""AI Chat"" whos answering you so they might not like you if you say something weird.

You must give a chance to this game and experience the fun with your way.
",1
28673,"game is still very buggy,  currently not worth the $12.  needs a lot of work, may areas still not implemented, so just a tease.",0
28674,"It's truly become a simulation game. I haven't seen a simulation game in the music genre that draws you in like this. It funly makes you feel like you're progressing step by step on the rockstar path. From the character creation screen to many different contents in the game, it promises many things beyond ordinary simulation games.",1
28675,"This game is so nostalgic for me... I love everything about it!! I am having so much fun with performing aka guitar hero/rock band-like format and playing the notes using keys on the keyboard. It's not too easy and not too hard. It's just enough to be challenging in a game-like way and not too much where it would be annoying, it's just RIGHT. I also love gradually increasing popularity and growing relationships. My goal is to eventually ask the bartender out lol I think if you loved playing guitar hero or rock band and you also enjoy simulation games like my summer car or cooking simulator then you'll definitely enjoy this game.",1
28676,"First of all, well done to everyone who contributed to the game, I hope you will be rewarded abundantly for your efforts. The game is very nice, I didn't even notice that 2 hours passed while I was trying to understand the game :) I think it will be among the best simulation games. GLHF",1
28677,"Game is really shallow atm, the Song playing is quite boring would need some improvements to be anywhere near the levels of say Guitar Hero. Not much to do in the game. I unlocked the studio and played at the best stage that's all the content for now.",0
28678,"Boring game play, soon after starting a new game there is nothing left to do. The AI chat feature is a nightmare and hardly works making the NPCs in the game useless.",0
28679,"First of all, GREAT GAMEPLAY for a game that is still pretty new. Tons of content that will keep you busy for over 4 hours. 5 hours playtime and I'm not even halfway done. Weirdly, tasks are repetitive but don't get boring cause they are just challenging enough to keep you on your toes. Good dialogue with NPC characters. Overall smooth gameplay mechanics. Also, funny as fuck that you can run over peds and hit people's car and no one cares. If you lose a shit ton of money at the casino, I recommend driving out and running over like 30 people. It's therapeutic in a way.

Second, and more importantly,
SUCH A GREAT FUCKING SUPPORT TEAM!
They have a Discord for this game and the devs are on there like 24/7. I left a comment at 5 in the morning and assumed I'd get a response in a couple of hours. Nope, in less than 2 min a dev hops in and says I can personally DM him. He then proceeds to write out full on paragraphs to help me with all of my problems. I kept DMing him after with like small problems but he was on top of it everytime. Such a nice and helpful dude and timely ass responses. 100/10. 

All in all, GOATED fucking game, GOATED dev team. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the future of this game. A lot of Steam sims games are clear money-grabs and unfinished projects that people use to just get money. This game truly seems like the devs and overall team had a true passion for creating a game that can be genuinely enjoyed by all sorts of different people. Really screams collaborative passion project indie vibes for a sims game which is hard to find on Steam.",1
28680,"pretty fun game and cool idea, but the AI chat system needs to be ran client-side somehow, requiring a constant stable internet connection for a game mechanic is silly and unreliable, people get constant connection errors.",1
28681,"The game is great, but we definitely need more than one slot to save the game, because I would record one for youtube and the other one I would switch, so I would switch in several different ways as well. I can't wait for new updates.",1
28682,"I got an angry cop on my back cuz I accidentally peed through the wall of an outdoors toilet. So yeah, the game is yank. But to me that is part of the fun. Flirting is fun, the AI is very fun to chat to. The rhythm game is fun but too easy at first with the small amount of buttons. Hope someday we will get 6 key mode too. The simulation part is okay. It's definitely got that way too big and empty world feel though, but that in and of itself is very simulation indie game like which despite being objectively bad is somehow kind of nostalgic already to me as so many indie simulation games share in that, so it has sort of this weird cheap charm to it. Still in EA with many things still being announced that I do hope won't remain empty promises.",1
28683,"Rock Star Life Simulator is an engaging and amusing dive into the chaotic world of rock stardom. The game brilliantly captures the wild and unpredictable journey of becoming a rock legend, complete with hilarious moments.
However, while the game is undeniably fun, it could benefit from a bit more refinement. Some mechanics feel slightly clunky, and a few bugs might interrupt the otherwise smooth gameplay. With a bit more polish, Rock Star Life Simulator could truly shine as a top-tier simulation game.
Despite these minor issues, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Rock Star Life Simulator a try. It's a great game to kick off your gaming session, offering a lighthearted and engaging experience that promises plenty of laughs and a good time.",1
28684,"Very fun game, as of writing this, it's got about maximum of 10 hours worth of gameplay. It seems like they're definitely working on adding more content to the game so that's very exciting! Overall very positive with the game!",1
28685,"fun game and cant wait for updates. 

only problem i experienced, and i dont know if anyone else had this issue, but when trying to record another persons song in the studio, the part where you have to fix the sound waves of certain instruments is too hard. i seem to never be able to get it mainly because it takes so long with such little time.",1
28686,"This is a really fun game and even in this early state totally worth the price! 
- I love the AI chat, really makes you think and be creative. 
- Playing the songs is fun every time, always a chance to bomb!
- Odd jobs in between trying to pick up chicks, great way to pass the time
- Social media elements are funny and feel very current

If the devs read these, some thing that should be added at some point:
- Look customization: more clothes, hats, tattoos etc. Also being able to change your hair style in-game.
- More places to pick up dates, 1-2 more bars would be great.
- More homes, maybe a penthouse?
- Basically more of everything (cars, guitars etc.) 
- Consider making an 'easy' mode for the actual playing, some people aren't good with these things. I admit once you get to 4 buttons for the songs I had some trouble.
- Add tiredness to hunger & bathroom so we'll be forced to end the day at some point, otherwise the only incentive to go to bed is next day's gig/money.",1
28687,What the actual hell is this!! It's absolutely AMAZING! It's a little rough around the edges but the core game play is great. The driving feels a little Roblox but the life sim mixed with a rhythm game like guitar hero is great! 6/10 easy! can't wait to see what they bring to the game!,1
28688,"I played the early access version of the game, then I loved the game so much I bought it here and I don't regret it at all. There is a learning curve to learning the songs but that's the fun part. Each song, you have to practice it to get better at playing it like a real song. This seems like a pretty small simple game right now, but it's surprisingly immersive and a whole lot of fun! You can date girls, drink beer, buy houses, a studio and cars and of course ROCK HARD! Oh, and you can make your own custom guitars and but them and they add to your charisma. It's really awesome! The Devs have more intentions in the future with this game so I'm excited to see what's next! Definitely worth the money!",1
28689,Very fun and good sim game with a solid framework. Not a ton of content finished most of it within 5 hours but i can see where they plan to add a lot more. The AI dating was very cool and unexpected and cant wait to see where it goes from there. Most of the songs were pretty good but needs a lot more. got stuck playing the last three songs over and over to get max profit. Need more band members and variety!,1
28690,"Nice game with a lot of potential only thing thats weird right now is talking to people when you flirt (for some reason they always dont understand what i say not even hello) other then that game works well and is enjoyable



29/2/2024 edit: I have to say after i opened the game the AI worked and i could talk so my only complain was fixed but my current complain is that the game has 'nothing' left for me (after almost 8 hours i got all houses guitars clothes cars and achievements but i understand its a work in progress so i wont rate it negatively). I still suggest getting this game and waiting for it to be fully out i think its worth its price",1
28691,"its fun im a huge fan def a little rough, some touches like music in the car, more band members, maybe little touches on graphics but ither than that really cool concept will keep playing cant wait to see what homie does",1
28692,"Even though it was the first version of the game, it was a very enjoyable game with a lot of content. 

I enjoyed the immersive progression of the fiction in the game and the freedom to do my own activities. I can't describe the joy of running around and peeing after flirting coolly in a bar. The crowds that gathered around you at concerts when you played your guitar made me feel like a rock star.

Visually I think it was very satisfying for a first version.  

I am Feeling like a rockstar!!!",1
28693,"--- Highly Recommend ---

I played the game for a while. If I were to comment on the game I played, it is a very fun game with a good main idea. In addition to the main story of being a rock star, the side mechanics are also very well handled. It's great fun to wander around the city and advance the game by playing on the streets. Besides, it is also well thought out to advance the game by interacting with other NPCs in the cafe.

I will add the good things I see later as I progress through the game. It will be fun right now. I definitely recommend it to those who want to play.",1
28694,"The game has a fun and vast story that can be played for days from the very beginning. The mechanics are very easy, and one feels very happy while playing. After all, you can't always be a Rock Star. I found the amount of money I paid to be insufficient; I recommend it to everyone.",1
28695,"I'm giving this game a thumbs up because it does a pretty good job of what it set out to do.

Upon first appearances you'd look at this like just another throwaway game cobbled together to make a quick buck. Well if it is, they did a good job of hiding that fact.

Keep in mind this game is early access and incomplete and it does have it's issues. Not a whole lot to do right now besides play music and whenever you're not playing music the game does get a bit boring. Also there's no real point in doing anything either. 

However the songs are awesome, the gameplay mechanic QTE for the music playing and song writing are interesting, engaging and fun and even a lot of the other aspects of this game are interesting as well. Like talking with the AI chat bot. That's fun...and terrifying.

It's gameplay components are solid, as its ideas and the general development mechanics of the game. Plus it's a cheap price. At the very least it'd entertain you during a long weekend.

But if you'd like a more in-depth look at the game please check out the video on my YouTube Channel (link below).

Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.",1
28696,"It was a game that I had a lot of fun, especially the songs were well chosen. it was very nice to give concerts in different venues, especially the ""melodify"" income made me very happy. i definitely recommend you to give it a chance.

9/10",1
28697,"Flirting with ai is interesting concept, I liked it. You can cheat on your girlfriend or boyfriend, I didn't expect the game to react to that. Worth price 10/10 xD",1
28698,This game is still in early access and when you create a character you realize how full it is. everything from handing out flyers to becoming a star and peeing on people (except the bartender),1
28699,"This simulation game is one of the best I've ever played.
It has excellent mechanics and gameplay. If you're a fan of simulation games, this is a must-have. The artificial intelligence integration is impressive, making it feel like you're talking to a human.  Even the AI alone is worth the purchase. Despite being in early access, the game already offers a substantial amount of content. It is expected to improve even further with future updates.",1
28700,"(sigh) Twenty one years ago in 2003, Electronic Arts did a much better job with the release of their Superstar expansion for The Sims. The graphics, the action, the songs, the animation, the content -- all of it was far superior to this effort, despite the passage of time with other inspired works such as The Sims 3, Guitar hero, Rock Band -- well, that's it for me, but all of these (including The Sims Superstar from 2003) were incomparably superior in making me feel like a rock star. I think it is reasonable to expect these influences to inspire anything following to be much better than this.

Frankly, I suspect this title and theme are far too ambitious for the apparent skill level of the development team. First of all, If you're going to attempt to simulate rock star lifestyle, the graphics should be amazing. Everything should look gorgeous -- not clunky. The graphics are nowhere near the level they need to be to provide an immersive experience simulating the glamour of a rock star existence. I mean, 1,000% improvement would not be enough. A whole new graphic style of presentation is what is needed, and I can't imagine that happening.

The AI chat available with a very limited number of NPC's is briefly impressive, but it's not that much fun making innocent small talk with a chatbot to maintain a relationship, and opportunity for such interaction is severely limited anyway. The reward for your effort is also quite unsatisfactory. Soon, I found it to be a very not-fun daily chore to maintain a numerically scored relationship level which drops daily for no reason, and drops precipitously if you choose to ""make love"" (I guess the character is exceptionally lousy at that!) The fulfillment of this action is presumed, and not shown. Considering the lack of any reward to the player for doing it, I soon stopped doing that so that I would not have to work so hard to recover the relationship level afterward. Most NPC's you see you cannot even interact with at all. It's all pointless, anyway. Again, in The Sims 3 (2005) NPC reactions to your rock star character were far better. In this implementation, fan recognition is often rude, even hostile.

There are side jobs you can do, and some of the minigame tasks associated with them (like tuning a guitar) are a bit clever in their implementation, but it's not enough. They've introduced a music studio for the player to buy and this is one rare instance where their focus is on track to make you feel like a rock star, or maybe just a record producer, but at least it's in the right ballpark, thematically. Nevertheless, there is little reason to do it. If you can afford to buy the studio, then you don't need the pittance of a reward that you get for completing these activities. Additionally, the music produced at the studio is awful and the performer animation is elementary. Otherwise, most of the other rudimentary content (casino games, aiming a stream of urine, fist-fighting rivals, driving a car, keeping yourself fed, etc) is missing the point, doing nothing to make you feel like a rock star, EXCEPT --

The main activity in the game is writing and performing songs. The developers have some good ideas in implementing mini-games to represent song-writing, and the songs are mostly somewhat musically pleasing, apparently original works but without lyrics. When performing the songs, the action is similar to Guitar Hero or Rock Band, but unlike those titles, this title hasn't bothered with animation of your band rocking out on stage. Unfortunately, the number of songs is very limited, and if this is all you want, Guitar Hero even on a PS2 is a much more immersive experience and a lot more satisfying.

In summary, this game is almost certain to disappoint. I paid $10 on sale and in retrospect, I wouldn't waste a buck on it. I'm sorry my review must be so harsh, because I know this game is in early development, but honestly, I don't see any promise in it. The design team does not seem to know what kind of content is relevant, but worse, the entire production is far too crude to simulate rock star life and would need a complete do-over from the beginning to succeed. The most noteworthy talent demonstrated by the development team is their creativity in making mini-games to represent tasks, but unfortunately it is not enough, and everything else is sub-par.",0
28701,"To be honest the game is pretty fun, but they should keep updating this game because if not, it is going to be a dead game real fast",0

28705,"This indie game reminds me of Guitar Hero! I used to love that game. Of course it's still new, but I am so excited for them to add more to the game. It needs more houses, clothes, vehicles, and areas. I haven't beat it completely yet, but almost there. The game definitely has potential! The option to chat is pretty cool too.

28711,"Unique mechanics with interesting ideas and fun gameplay with friends. I usually don't like horror games but Ominous is not just a horror game in which you run around and scream, there is a gameplay loop that cleverly thought but easy to understand that can keep you for tens of hours. If you love games lile Phasmaphobia and Lethal Company, Ominous is definitely worth try and it's an another proof that indie games carry this genre. 
Final note: we need a chair race mode",1
28712,I think this game has potential has a few bugs in the game but if you are willing to tweak with it and figure out how to work around the bugs its not to hard now to escape a map is the challenging part slow down the moving blocks on the lava platforming part and i think the game would be good also maybe add some ominous music to the game so the game isn't so quiet,1
28713,"Ominous is a fresh concept into gameplay but the slowness of the game in the TUTORIAL alone did not give me the urge to go any further. I found the sound quality lacking, the animations in-game rather slow or lame to say the least. The vibe of the dimensions where more like a hotel and when you jumped from one to another it felt as though I was just going to another floor as only the door number changed!

While I get the concept, I did not get the difficulty of finding and/or interacting with the buttons/items or even what was required of me via the TUTORIAL text. So doing this in-game would surely lead to my demise and/or frustration. While Ominous is early access and loads can change, I feel that the DEV(s) need to hear from the community as the feedback/ideas will help move the game forward.

While I was lucky enough to get a KEY, I still found that the price point and setup options are excellent. Other then that I really can not see myself playing Ominous more then I already have. I may revisit the game once several updates are applied. If your interested in Ominous, make sure to do your homework before investing. Good Luck

F.Y.I.: The most fun in-game is the ANNOYING DANCING BARTENDER that takes so much time to bounce around just to give you your items, after you paid one cent or dollar for them. LOL!

Their is a light story to accompany the game and and you can access the in-game shop to purchase extra undo's, jokers, wild-cards, shuffles, double coins and removal of a card (selected or random) at any point in the level. However those shop items will NOT carry over to the next level. It is only for the current level so don't buy a bunch of jokers thinking you have a few to last you.

28726,"[b]solitaire quest: garden story[/b] is yet another generic +1/-1 card game that doesn't offer anything new but it was supposed to be a welcome change after the endless lazy suricate (jewel match) and 8floor reskins, if they even bother to change the skin at all. the garden theme is not really for me but I'll take anything over atlantis for the billionth time. I thought the dev would be a welcome change too. boy, was I wrong.

I found a bunch of issues outlined below, but instead of fixing them (shouldn't take long in competent hands), they told me of their 15-year experience and intentional design decisions based on all sorts of player feedback. no idea who would think some of these are in any way convenient, acceptable or should be a standard, [b]making games for a casual audience shouldn't mean throwing common sense out the window[/b]. no wonder you can't tell these games apart, it's as if they were all made by the same hivemind (or probably [i]for[/i] the same hivemind). I thought these guys were new on the scene, would explain a lot, but they're just as bad as suricate. call themselves playzzy, the 'p' must be silent.

[b]200 levels[/b], a good amount, doesn't overstay its welcome. one level unlocked at a time but besides the stars themselves, [b]a different color should indicate imperfect levels[/b] so they're easier to find on level select. [b]4 ways to play[/b] to please everybody, with optional per-turn or per-level timer or untimed with extra cards. it can be changed anytime. the optional in-game help explains what you already know. grab crystals hidden under cards, some are frozen, locked, etc. they [b]really went overboard with the annoying 'face changes after x turns' nonsense[/b]. grabbing the crystals is enough for 3 stars most of the time, except when it's not. it must be based on the number of cards left, not mentioned anywhere of course, nor is there an on-screen star progress.

there's an [b]illustrated diary[/b] and some dialog with a paper-thin narrative and a [b]garden to decorate[/b] with the crystals. they're 'upgrades' and have to be bought in order, can't go straight for the one you actually want to see. [b]endless mode[/b] unlocks after about 30 levels and not only is it endless but also pointless. unlimited deck, no undo, no shop, a tiny bit of extra cash. as soon as the board starts to clear, more cards appear, enjoy if you can.

[b]power-ups are fucked up.[/b] shuffle, turn cards up, etc. bought from the shop, only accessible from a level, as they're all per-level and used instantly, except [b]jokers and wildcards, which are lost at the end of the level[/b] whether you used them or not. also, [b]can't use the spade to remove a card if there's only one left[/b], last altogether or the others locked, defeating the very purpose of that power-up. shuffle is very conditional as well, even if there are plenty of cards to mix up, 5 is apparently not enough. and they went even further: [b]everything gets more and more expensive with each purchase throughout the game[/b]. instant consumables with an ever-increasing price tag, genius.

but wait, there's more. offering [b]5 extra cards for 100 gold at the end of an incomplete level[/b] is a very mobiley but potentially helpful thing to do, except [b]there's no confirmation and the button is right under the last card[/b], in the upper half. another example of stellar game design, a misclick losing you a bunch of money.

I've lost count by now but here's another never-before-seen idiocy: [b]undo changes the next card[/b]. missed matching the 7, you see the next is a king, undo, match the 7, draw next card and it won't be the king again. are you serious? [b]achievements are bugged[/b] as well. don't care personally but the one for completing 50 levels with 3 stars popped after 35. and they only appear outside levels, not when conditions are actually met (or not met, as it were).

[b]navigation is awkward but still nowhere near the nonsense one has to deal with in jewel match solitaire.[/b] game mode selection comes up when starting a new game but there's no confirm button, gotta close the window to continue. there are [b]single screens of text with a skip button when it should say continue[/b], there's nothing to skip. and the level complete screen should have more buttons (menu, map, garden) and [b]continue shouldn't lead to the garden every fucking time[/b], whether you can upgrade something or not, but load the next level.

as you'd expect, the game is very pleasing to the eye, except for the very basic main font. there are a few card customization options, separate volumes, a non-resizable but much smaller windowed mode, game cursor toggle, in-game representation of achievements and multiple player profiles. unfortunately, [b]settings aren't accessible from the pause menu[/b], gotta go back to the main menu to adjust volumes, and [b]progress is stored in the registry, the worst possible place[/b]. don't even dream about cloud saves. and esc doesn't bring up the pause menu because why would it?

all things and questionable decisions considered, it's [b]a whole lot worse than most other games in the genre and the bar isn't exactly high[/b]. since it evidently won't get the extra attention it badly needs, not even basic grammar fixes, it's not something to recommend. not sure why loading a level takes so long either. my pc is ancient but not as much as the system requirements and come on, it's a very basic card game that should work on a broken toaster. tried it on more recent hardware, no problem there (except for [b]deliberately slow animations when levels get laid out[/b]), but it still gets the award for [b]worst performance in a solitaire ever[/b]. 15 years of 'extensive experience' my ass.",0
28727,"""Solitaire Quest: Garden Story"" is a solitaire card game with extra features. While it doesn't innovate the genre, it's a fine addition, if you like such games, especially considering its price. Pretty graphics, cute animations and relaxing sounds are there to accompany you on your quest to restore the pretty garden!

You can expect powers-ups and minigames to make your gameplay easier and more entertaining on those 200 levels. While you are playing the game, you will earn coins to spend on power-ups, help actions and, most importantly, buying decorations to restore the garden. There is a story to give flavor to the game! On top of that, you get the endless mode after a few levels into the game, in addition to those we already have (normal, timed, relax and challenge). You'll see various mechanics used such as unlock a card by finding the key, unfreeze cards, put the fire out, etc.

28728,"[b]Note:[/b] An awesome friend gifted me a copy of this game. ^^

[i]Solitaire Quest: Garden Story[/i] is a card solitaire game developed and published by Playzzy Games.  You take on the role of an unnamed female character who has just inherited her Aunt Diana's garden, as her aunt has retired from gardening and is now traveling.  As you attempt to improve your aunt's rundown garden, Steve, a rival gardener who has lost gardening contests to Aunt Diana, approaches you, sneering your efforts and offering to buy the garden.  However, you refuse to rise to the bait, continuing your efforts, and even get encouragement from Amanda, Aunt Diana's close friend who also happens to be a yearly judge of the gardening contests.  What will happen?  I know I'm leaving this on a cliffhanger, but I don't wish to reveal spoilers and all that. XD

As for the gameplay, there are a total of 200 levels in story mode, and you can choose from among four game modes: normal, timed, relax, or challenge.  (For review purposes, I chose to play in normal mode.)  Endless mode is unlocked after you complete a certain number of levels.  You can choose from among various card designs and such.  When you start a level, you're given a layout of cards on the board, and the objective is to obtain the required number of flowers, which you obtain by clearing the board of cards.  There's a store where you can purchase boosters, such as jokers and the ability to randomly eliminate a card, to help you complete the levels easier.  You purchase boosters using coins, which you can earn as you complete levels.  The flowers are used to purchase decorations for the garden, and as you purchase a certain number of decorations, part of the story gets unlocked.  Also, Steam/in-game achievements are present although they won't count towards a user's global total until the game is out of ""Steam is learning about this game"".

Now that I've gone over the story and gameplay, I'll move onto my thoughts.  Every once in a while, I enjoy a relaxing game of solitaire, and [i]Solitaire Quest: Garden Story[/i] delivers that.  The story is pretty basic, but it's enough to move the game along.  There's the typical villain as well as moral support for the MC.  However, the main crux of the game is the gameplay.  I had no trouble completing most of the levels although those last three levels proved to be a bit challenging, as I had to replay them a few times before I was finally able to obtain all of the required flowers.  Although there are no mini-games, unlike some solitaire games, I was never bored while playing through the levels.  It's nice getting to play a simple game of solitaire.  All of the achievements unlocked for me without any problems.

As for the art, it is quite beautiful to gaze at.  The cards and backgrounds are lovely, and I especially liked the garden.  It was great to witness how purchasing upgrades improved the garden's appearance, and it's fun to customize what decorations you want.  In regards to the soundtrack, there's only one track, so I wish that there had been more variety.  Regardless, the instrumental track that was present is very relaxing and soothing to listen to, perfect as you play through the levels.

Overall, would I recommend [i]Solitaire Quest: Garden Story[/i]?  If you're looking for a fun, simple, relaxing game of solitaire, then this is worth taking a look.  It's pretty doable to complete and earn all of the achievements.  For the asking price, I'd say that it's definitely worth it, as it took me about 11 hours to finish the game and such. ^^

28729,"[h1]I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH I'M PLAYZZYing IT A SECOND TIMEüÉè[/h1]
I'm actually kind of picky about Solitaire games because they have to have specific features. Most importantly, it has to allow me to remove all cards (not just special cards) and it has to have the option to replay levels as often as I deem necessary.
¬†
Solitaire Quest: Garden Story has 200 levels that can be played in a Relaxed, Normal, Timed, or Challenge Mode. It also has an Endless Mode that allows you to play a never-ending game with infinite deck cards.
¬†
I don't enjoy Timed Modes in a Solitaire game, and I would have loved it if they offered a Hard Mode, which was more challenging than the normal mode but either didn't have a timer or had a way to disable the timer.
¬†
There are several Obstacles available, such as Frozen Cards that need to be played twice, Ivy Cards that require Garden Shear Cards, Root Covered Cards that require playing Axe Cards, Padlocked Cards that require Key Cards, Fire Cards that require Watering Can Cards, and Wax Seal Cards & Wax Seal Cards of Specific Suits that require you to play red & black or suit specific Cards to remove the seals. As you progress, a whole slew of obstacles are thrown into levels to make them quite challenging!

Until the last levels, could not finish the game as there were not enough crystals to finish the garden and find out the ending of the game. If I would have known that I would not have devoted 15 hours of my time I cannot get back. Until the game producers make an update I would not waste the money or time on the game.

So I commend them for listening to their customer, the game is now officially fun in my opinion",1

If you like the Jewel Match series of solitaire, this might be of interest to you, and if you are the developer, you might feel a bit confused, and are rethinking how you choose to which curators you send games.

I guess it's just like solitaire.  Sometimes you flip the next card over and it's the ace you were hoping for, and sometimes it's just a packet of instant oatmeal.  Maybe it's Quaker¬Æ Instant Oatmeal, 100% whole grains, and packed with flavor in every bite.
So if you can't get enough solitaire or oatmeal, why not make Solitaire Quest: Garden Story part of your morning routine.

Sending me back to the garden after every level instead of the map was a little annoying, mostly just made the game go by slower than it needed. I do recommend but only on sale


A bug i encountered was sometimes the card in my hand shows the wrong card (ill play a 2 on a 3 and my hand then shows 10)",1
28734,"I enjoyed this game for several reasons: it's a good solitaire game with 200 levels, a story and a garden to build with the tokens you earn. I set the game on ""Relaxed"" which made it super easy to progress through the levels--it seemed the right card always came up and it was rare that I needed to ""buy 5 more cards"" to complete a level. I personally didn't like the music, especially with such a short loop it became way to repetitive. I ended up playing the game with no music while I watched football on TV (divided attention of course but relaxed mode made this easy). It was fun to keep going to complete the garden upgrades!",1

[b]Personal Comment[/b] The Creature Zone VR: Nightfall delivers a highly immersive and spooky VR experience with its detailed environments and tense sound design. The interactive gameplay adds to the sense of immersion, making it engaging for horror fans.

However, performance issues and technical glitches can disrupt the experience, and the predictable gameplay and sparse storyline may limit the overall enjoyment. Outdated visuals also detract from the overall polish of the game.

Overall, The Creature Zone VR: Nightfall is a decent horror VR game with strong atmospheric elements but is hampered by technical issues and a lack of depth in certain areas.

28745,amazing game from small dev studio :),1
28746,"the game dosent even have a build game option. so you cant save your game. you can litterally only play it inside of the game. i mean its just not what you would of thought it is ""Game Maker"".",0
28747,"Cyber Prison Management is a really badly made, well, I guess it could be called a tycoon/management game/hybrid action game (?) where you take on the role of a prisoner or the prison system itself and manage various aspects of prison life... as a prisoner your goal is not just to survive but escape, and of course as the AI your goal is to stop all that nonsense.  This might all work if the implementation was fine, but the implementation here is frankly, well, comically bad. 

Gameplay involves clicking through various cameras to see the prison, interacting with stuff, sneaking around... the game design itself is quite convoluted and doesn't stick to clean lines and clear gameplay.  It's hard to tell what's going on at all, in fact.  This isn't close to games like Prison Architect. 

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

The artwork here is terrible, it's all just amateurish ""My First Wacom Tablet"" style drawings used instead professional looking game assets.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can create graphical assets properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low, enough on its own to deter gamers.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The implementation here is of such poor quality, the developer couldn't work out how to make the game display in fullscreen, it only runs in a window.

The controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just point and click stuff like a browser/Flash game.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the video game library/engine, GDevelop's Electron, which is really a container for HTML5 like browser/mobile apps.  It's rarely used, because it's arguably worse than construction kits like GameMaker Studio, RPGMaker and Clickteam Fusion, but it's also much harder to work with.  Despite this, it also has very limited capabilities, which go some way to explaining the poor quality of the game.  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

The very poor quality of this game puts it squarely on-par with ancient 1990's Flash/Java games, and given it's 2024 (and this was released not so far back in 2023), gamers and the industry expect and deserve better than this kind of low effort shovelware.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

Cyber Prison Management has the comically over-optimistic price of $10 USD, for which you could easily get any number of older AAA games.  Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

For comparison, the $10 asking price for this game could get you games like ""Europa Universalis IV"", ""Subnautica"" or ""Mass Effect Andromeda"".  Quality, professionally made games like those are frequently on sale cheaper than this.

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.[/quote]",0

28750,"This is an extremely short VN. It will take you no more than 45 minutes to finish the story and that's if you bother to read it and not just click through. The translation isn't great and the story isn't either. It's very bland. There are choices to make in the chapters and if you pick the wrong one you fail the mission. Then you are kicked back to the beginning of the story, because it doesn't auto save your progress after each chapter, which is extremely annoying. I got to chapter 4, made the wrong choice, failed the mission, and had to start the game all over. NOT FUN!!! The renders are very basic, static, nice, but nothing to write home about. The mini game modes are so awful they aren't worth your time. The Secret Mission mode is particularly bad. The hit box is so off I found myself shooting through the zombies body and head and nothing registered despite the shot clearly going through the target on screen. Yes Horny Spy: Secret Mission is only $4.99 and that's not a lot of money, but no I don't think you should buy it. Take your money elsewhere.",0

You Click at the start to get resources and then you can upgrade to automate or idle resources. The game is only $3 so, if you'd like to see this game get developed further and see where it goes then buy it. However, be aware that its quite possible that the game never receives an update and you are getting a game that is very incomplete and not really worth playing at current state and you waste $3.

It's a remastered classic RTS with unique gameplay, lore and story. If you want something new and refreshing, try it.
It's best played in Russian if you know the language, because the voicing is great, and in the official English translation a lot of the lore is missed. This version, however, comes with ""True English Translation"", which I guess is acceptable compromise - uncut lore, but mission briefings are with English text and Russian voice, and these are very worth not skipping through, because they're really good.

I'm really surprised to see the updated textures. I've read that they done it, but was skeptical because the screenshots look pretty much the same. But I've made a comparison of the same things in original and this. The changes are subtle, but noticeable. Which is perfect in my opinion.

The movies are widescreen, which is a nice touch too.

It's very nice to have content from both games in skirmish, maps and sides. In originals, there's only selection of default frames, but here, no content from campaign is wasted.

The ""community"" option in the menu also has some goodies. For example, a link to GitHub with source code.

Soundtracks from both games are in the game's directory, which is nice, but it would be l33t to have them also as Steam soundtracks.

[spoiler]This was the game which expanded my conscience in 2004. Many good memories.

Personally, I would not advise paying so much for Perimeter. But with this you support the creators of the game (Unfortunately, not KranK anymore)

But it is very nice that it is finally possible to play in 16:9, and even choose a monitor.
Glad to be able to play multiplayer without radminVPN/hamachi, and finally without desyncs that spoiled games.

Well, the balance, as I see it, has changed quite a bit. This is also visible in the single player campaign, which has become a little more difficult in my opinion. Btw, here are both campaigns: the original and from the Emperor's Testament.

And a nice bonus is the possibility of modding, although I did not delve into it. 


Among the negatives, I would like to note that this is the same original game (that thanks to open source, was able to receive fixes from enthusiasts)

28764,"Do you enjoy fighting man-made horrors within our comprehension? (they are a result of our inner sponge, after all) Well then boy do I have the RTS game for you.  In this game you will battle a variety of different opponents from many different classes, but by far the most unique aspect of your troops is that they are all of the classes and none of the classes. You see, when you want a rocket troop, you don't order for a rocketer to be made, you order the entire squad to reform their matter into rocketers. You don't just build a transporter for your troops, your troops are the transporter. And this isn't just some mechanic, you see this happen to the troops, as each one liquifies right before your eyes, and reforms itself into whatever you choose. 

There is also probably one of the main draws to this game, at least for me, and that is the fact that you can reform the entire map as you please, void some special exceptions. You watch as the comparatively small drones move the earth around, redefining the landscape in the will of the Legate. 

PERIMETER: Legate Edition is everything I was hoping for in a a light remaster of the original. The texture and engine updates may sound small but I assure you they make quite the difference.

28775,"This game is a take on the beton brutal gameplay where you climb one big map by jumping on platform ladder trampoline etc. 

They are trying to be different from it and funnily enough, that's where the flaw appear. Instead of having blocky platform they have some rocky ground platform which are hard to determine if you can stand on them or slide off them. There's no ""spec cam"" so some jump are just impossible to know where to go since you cant look around a wall before jumping there.
The ladder are slow and you cant really stand on them.

It's fine that they try to be creative but in this case, it only created flaw",0
28776,"[h1]As if you've ordered ""Mirror's Edge"" on wish[/h1]
Okay let's pretend you really want to play this game decently. First of all - the default settings are not very helpful. Just deactivate the FOV jump visuals and set your FOV up to 120%. Now you can see around and don't get distracted by annoying motion blur (or whatever realistic bs graphics was intended by the dev). 

Next is the setting: You are trapped in a cave probably somewhere in SEA. Sometimes at the beginning you can follow the paintings on the walls but later on in the game they will fade out and you'll find yourself in a mf HOG, like guessing which wall is the next climbable, where to jump safely or is there not a trampoline below which can be used once or twice. 

Now my main point this game deserves a total downvote - they messed up the ladders. 
1.by default you climb down on ladders not rest on the step you are on. 
2.to reach the upper step you always have to glitch while looking to your shoes. Otherwise you won't be able to jump off from top of the ladder. 
3.because ladders are curved steel hooks in the wall you can be attached to them from 3 different sides while you would only need to climb them up from the middle side. There is no way to climb around sideways.

Ladders are probably not the most important lack of the game, but to reach out  the last achievement (after the finished stage2) there is an extremely hard ladder placed which seems almost as unclimbable.

To round up my negative first impression they added some bs language with lots of ""pak"" and needed subtitles which supposed to be funny I guess?

Wouldn't buy the full game, because I know the difference between ""challenging"" and ""non-functional""",0

28783,An enjoyable soundtrack to relax to while chilling afterwork. Thank you to Sodaraptor for finally releasing this on Steam.,1
28784,A great soundtrack for a great game. Very whimsical and dream like. Even including those darker dreams. (Also: Thera my beloved),1
28785,"Otherworldly mix of music that leaves a strong impression after playing the game. Some of it feels lonely, some of it is plain cool, some of it is relaxing, or even disturbing. And nearly all of it feels retro as fuck.

28786,"I played this game a while back but stopped when things got a bit too spooky. The game wields the unease of terror very well. Thankfully there were no jump-scares, or were there? :) Shout out to the goat of psx aesthetics sodaraptor.

28787,"Well... it's nice to have a download of this music, especially as FLACs, but this is bizarrely put together.

Tower World's theme is very [i]very[/i] clearly an old mix. It sounds as it did in [url=https://youtu.be/PEhTOuiDwFc?t=2003]the original upload of the soundtrack[/url] on youtube back in 2021, rather than the version in-game which matches the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQjw3USYfak]extended youtube upload.[/url]

There are also some odd flubs in a few of the tracks - Mist World's theme seems to have a weird little artifact of some sort at one part, Gogi's theme might have a bad loop although it could just be how the song sounds because it's a little weird generally (and it seems to start fading before the loop happens, which is sloppy but not that bad), the Dream Nexus theme isn't as egregious as Tower World but it's also a worse mix than the extended upload. There are likely some other issues I haven't listed, too, but even if it's just these that's still pretty bad... It doesn't [i]ruin[/i] the soundtrack or anything, but I know I would have put in more care than this, and I already have for far less consequential projects like a Spelunky music mod.

Also... the Nowhere theme seems to be the same mix as the extended upload, but. it starts out mono. If you split the stereo tracks into two mono tracks, then invert one of them, that [i]should[/i] completely cancel out all noise and result in nothing at all. ...but instead you hear compression artifacts, meaning that it wasn't rendered out as a FLAC originally, it was instead converted to a FLAC from a lossy format, defeating the entire point of a FLAC. Best case scenario that's the only song that wasn't rendered as a FLAC, worst case [i]none[/i] of the files are truly losslessly compressed.

There's a chance that this was a weird set of mishaps out of the control of the person who compiled this. And if so... fair enough (and sorry, maybe this is a bit harsh). Still not ideal though...",1

28793,"First of all the big question: Is the translation good? Yes it is.

The game is simple yet beautiful. Don't be deceived by how it looks like yet another Slay The Spire clone. The gameplay is very different and engaging. The dice system adds randomness, some of which you can mitigate by your skill choices and equipment. The start feels railroady because it is essentially a tutorial baked into the first run don't be alarmed.

The story seems good. As explained on the store page it is based on Ancient Chinese mythology/history with the creator's interpretation and imagination thrown in.

Gameplay Loop:
1 - On the main map you chose which location to go. This part is linear.
2 - In each location there are story elements, which you access by clicking on their cards.
3 - Each Story Element(which can be a person, a location with people/shops/questgivers, enemy etc...) has its own small story. This part actually is reminiscent of Erannorth Games.
4 - Each Story Element can be solved by making choices, making skill checks, or combat.
5 - After completing a Story Element you gain experience, sometimes you also gain some loot. You gain skill points as you level up.
6 - You can spend these skill points on your character screen to create your own build. My favourite part: You can actually completely change the initial skills, don't like one? Just set it to 0 and regain its point investment. As you spend skill points your passive abilities also get unlocked(Don't be like me and wait 3 levels so that you can buy that +1 dice)

Skill Checks: In this game skill checks are done via throwing dice. There are 6 faces on dice: Yin, Yang, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise. Yang Dices can be used as substitutes for any other dice except Yin. You have 1 chance to match the required dice type to pass the check. Basically Yin is 1, Yang is 6. Yin is normally unusable but the skills that can use Yin are usually very strong.

Combat: At the start of combat rounds you roll your dice. Each round you also have 3 reroll options and you can use/lock the dices you like before rerolling. You have all your skills available to you. However to use them you must pay their dice cost. This part is similar to Immortal Way of Life's combat. As you level up(or equip related items) you gain extra dice throws or dices of one type so that tutorial episode dice starvation will soon be going away don't worry.

For 5$ this game is a 10/10 buy. 

Note: The game sometimes feels like it is stuck during the start but after a minute or so the menu appears. They probably forgot adding a loading bar at the very start. Don't let this discourage you. It might also simply a me problem but just writing it here in case someone else encounters it.",1
28794,"Cool gameplay, never seen using dice as stamina before. The story is pretty good so far. It feels a bit like Hand of Fate. Worth a try.",1
28795,"Only just started but all around loving it. The dice as your mana/points per turn is cool as heck and not to hard to pick up on. The translation is good so far. The subtitles cut off a bit on the screen when the pretty white haired man speaks to you, but other than that the game explains the mechs pretty well. You are told you can always go back to settings to find the help/tips again. The art work is so amazing!!!!",1
28796,"I honestly didn't expect too much from this game, the whole play dice on cards intrigued me but then I played the demo and what actually grabbed my real attention is that the story is amazing which more or less plays out as a visual novel with choices, deaths and failure states.
I haven't really played (or consumed much Chinese media) to begin with, but all this mythology I have never heard about just makes everything so interesting to me. The commentary from the Fisherman (the DM in the background) is also quite funny.

Also do have to say the story itself gets quite brutal (Ch.2 spoiler) 
[spoiler]R.I.P. Ji Yun, Ji Yu and Ji Feng :'([/spoiler] made me cry for an hour and also has quite some other dark moments but that definetly just adds to the fascination of wanting to see what's next. The failure states are also really intricate and detailed sometimes. Not just ""you died"" but several paragraphs of horrible things playing out.
The English translation - even though it's noted Alpha in the menu - is absolutely good, some obscure choices of words sometimes, but perfectly understandable.

The card art looks beautiful, and there is so many of it, even scenery you only see for like two paragraphs or so. I also haven't checked the artbook yet due to risk of spoilers.

The game itself does feel a bit janky with some effects, saving inside dungeons seems to run into issues and some of the effect text is really tiny but like those are the biggest issues I've came across.

Completion Edit: I have finished the game at this point, Dungeon saving no longer has issues. Missing text is barely a problem anymore.
The story was stunningly emotional, invoked feelings of happiness, grief, anger, so many tears and a desire to see everything through. Thank you so much for translating this and sharing your culture and mythology. The art is stunning and going into my wallpaper rotation. I learned so many new things too! ([spoiler]Metal[/spoiler] is an element!?)

28797,"Fatermyth is a great game if you know what you're getting into. 

This includes:
‚Ä¢ Interesting, but rarely challenging dice TTRPG gameplay (Every character has a cheese strat- there are few fights that challenge or circumvent it)
‚Ä¢ A story that splits between seven protagonists. You go through everyone once, then go through 4 of them twice, then go back to the start to finish it off
‚Ä¢ Said protagonists barely meeting up in their own stories. 5 of those images up there ^ on the page only happen in the last ~4 hours of the game, and this includes the art and gameplay of the protags interacting with each other.
‚Ä¢ Stiff and passive English translation 
‚Ä¢ You (as a playable character) having to beat and charm a man in combat to have an ""intimate"" scene with him

I really don't think this is a bad game, hence the positive review, but it's certainly rough around the edges. There are still some untranslated ""pages"" of the story here and there (thankfully you usually don't lose much), and the overall English translation is written in a way I (personally) found severely unengaging and detached. There are exceptions to this- and the game is wonderfully written when it drops this, but it's not very often. I can tell there's a good story here, with every individual protag and overall, but it was hard to connect to. So, in a way, it's kind of a perfect representation of sitting on a boat while a guy tells you why you should care about all of these people. 

I would best describe this game as a severely railroaded D&D campaign with simpler mechanics. There are choices in this game for sure, but they barely ever matter. If you don't pick what the game wants, it tends to just kill you instantly. There are some situations in which this makes sense, but I got sort of sick of getting fail-states for menial decisions after awhile. The game wants to tell its story, and all you need to do is play the right moves and press the right buttons. 

My biggest active criticism of the game lies with my last bulletpoint. If you don't want to do that (and you have to play through that incident twice on both sides, same result), I wouldn't recommend the game. That incident [spoiler] becomes the basis of Teal Guy and Fox's (using simpler names for identification) relationship, and their second-half stories are about their blooming romance and fated destiny together. The game likes to call their initial incident passionate impulse, but the fact that Teal Guy had to be charmed and defeated for it to happen is... certainly something. I tried to avoid Fox throughout the entire rest of the game for this, to no avail. Gifting her the skinned corpse of her kin gives me a fail-state, and you can't progress to the last section of the game without grabbing her spirit... I just need my boy Bai Chi to find a better girl... [/spoiler]",1
28798,"A real hidden gem. Anyone who is a little bit interested in a good story and simple yet quite unique card battle system should try this game.
It has its unique charm not many other game had, and I've played a lot of them. 

Story is split into different characters and you experience their journey one by one. 
And each and every one of them are powerful enough to make your heart beat faster. You can feel how much passion went into this small project

Just give it a try. If you can enjoy the battle system, you will absolutely love this game",1

28802,"UPDATED:

Finished the game, found all collectibles, unlocked & completed the bonus mini-game as well.

If you enjoy slasher flicks or yearn for games like Friday the 13th on the NES and Clock Tower 1 and 2 on the SNES and PSOne, then look no further.  Terror at Oakheart will most definitely quench your...  appetite.  

The story is very well presented for a game that is comprised of 2D Pixel Art and animation.  The pacing seems to be right on the money.  There are Lite Puzzle elements with classic action/adventure horror game vibes.  I haven't completed the game yet, but I can confirm that the atmosphere is completely engrossing and will leave players thrilled & chilled during and between scary events.

I must also mention the music and sound effects as they are top notch!  I truly did not expect such an unsuspecting game to have such great music and sound.  

Terror at Oakheart should take approximately 2.5 hours to complete for your average gamer.  I think the price point is just right, given that the experience is well crafted, engaging, and oozing with the appropriate atmosphere.  I'm looking forward to seeing how things churn-out in Oakheart.

Lastly, and this would be my only major gripe, is that there is no Full Controller Support.  There is however, a rudimentary level of controller support.   I've played both the demo and the full game now.  The Demo does have a bug or two when using a controller or gamepad, however, I didn't come across any bugs during my time with the Full Game release.  It is unfortunate that we don't have full gamepad support yet, though it looks like the developer is working on it since there is placeholder artwork in the options menu showing a Controller and what each button on the controller does.  However, once again, this placeholder art does not show the correct controls for the game (yet).

I have been able to figure out the controls very easily using an Xbox One Gamepad.  The 'Y' button seems to interact with objects, while the left analog handles the movement, the right trigger fires weapons, and the 'A' button dodges.  The ""Select"" button brings up the inventory menu, and the Start Button toggles the Options Menu (in-game).  There is one tiny section in the game where you must crouch and that, unfortunately, is not mapped to the gamepad in any way shape or form.  The only way to crouch right now is by pressing 'C' on the keyboard (unless you go through the trouble of mapping new controls through Steam's Controller Profiler).  Also, if you've forgotten your objective during a particular chapter, just press and hold the 'Q' key on the keyboard.  I don't know why these two actions were never mapped to the controller or gamepad.  Thankfully, you only need to use crouch in one small section of the game and most of the time the objectives are very straight forward.

I sincerely hope gamepad support is fully implemented in the near future because this is a banger of a game.  If you enjoy campy horror fun with classic Splatterhouse atmosphere (circa TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Genesis), then you'll enjoy this fun little adventure horror game with it's engaging story, eerie environments, and chilling soundscape.",1
28803,A fun horror game with lots of brutal executions and multi-character gameplay where nobody is safe!,1
28804,"It's sadly not really scary as the title implies. It's a decent retro game with good graphics though. Doesn't take too long to complete. There are no choices, it's 100% linear. You do need to run around and find items though. Overall it's enjoyable.",1
28805,"A pixelated tromp through classic horror movies. I wish I could give this a thumbs up but it's so basic. I wish I had done more research before I bought it. That said this is not a bad game but besides ""go here"" and ""press F"" there isn't much to do or play here. Honesty, I think this would be better as a mini film or something because the graphics and music are great. But the gameplay leaves a lot to desire.",0
28806,"So the game is great and as a horror fan I get the references and it really is a treat for any gore hound. Very nice setup which leads to a pretty solid finale. However I can't in good conscience recommend it due to the final boss and that level in general. So I get that the developers felt the need to do some kind of elaborate final fight in order to prolong the game/give some gameplay value but here it just doesn't work (at least for me) Combat is super clunky to begin with and the fact that you have to go through the same dialogue lines over and over when you lose made me quit after getting to phase 4 only 2 times.
So TLDR game is actually very good, an 8/10 from me especially since it's fairly cheap and you can tell a lot of love was poured into it, however the final fight just breaks it for me and thus I have to thumb it down.",0
28807,Loved it! Great nod to classic slashers. The tone and vibe is great. Music very much NES-inspired and it works so well. There's even a DODGE yooooo. 9/10 because of the doggie killing otherwise it'd be a 10.,1
28808,"TL: DR - TERROR AT OAKHEART is a love letter to 80‚Äôs slasher flicks. Toss in some cosmic and body horror as well and you have fun, well animated and looking Retro side scroller slasher.  Though it has a few flaws I 100% recommend this game to those who want something unique in horror games.  8/10

The TO LONG. DID READ.

TERROR AT OAKHEART at its core is a love letter to 80‚Äôs slashers like Friday the 13th and more.  This game you get to see all sides of the story. From playing as TEDDY as he hunts down his victims to feed the flesh god.  Too playing those who are doomed to not survive the night. 

Graphics ‚Äì
As you can see the focus is on retro pixel-based game play.  Each chapter looks create and the animations play out very well. You can see that time and care went into creating how things look and move. Even more so when you get to the kills in the game.  For fans of 80‚Äôs Slasher flicks that had to cut out most of every kill to keep an R rating.  In here you get to see some of the iconic kills from slasher flicks recreated in pixelated bloody mayhem.   From the to the over the top.  

Game Play ‚Äì 
The gameplay in this game is very simple.  It‚Äôs move left or right. Dodge roll, attack and reload, then lastly interact.  The two main flaws in game play this game suffer from a ‚ÄúOrder of operations‚Äù and lack of I-Frames.   Though you can find out with ease the rhythm of combat for each monster.  The biggest issue is you can still be damaged, and killed, in moments that you have no way to fight back.   EXAMPLE:  if you are transitioning between doors in the game.  You are not safe. You can take 1 to 2 hits trying to leave an area if you are not far enough away.  I feel the gameplay would be greatly improved If you have some I-Frame moments when the Transition starts.   The other is the ODER OF OPERATIONS.  This is double edged.  You must do things in the order the game wants you to. There is no real wiggle room for this.   You always must do part A before you even try part B.  First play through is not that bad but on your moments where you replay parts after death. It can be a bit annoying.  I do understand WHY it‚Äôs here, but it can still be a bother to deal with. 

Story
The story of the game is what you would expect of a 80‚Äôs slasher.  Don‚Äôt come here looking for depth and world changing ideas that make you question your own humanity. This is a SLAHSER.  Sit back and enjoy the mayhem with a smile as mayhem unfolds. 

Replay ability ‚Äì
This game sadly has very little reason to replay the game once you beat it.  There are collectables that if you just do a little bit of exploration as you play, you will find ALL on your first run.   There is a reward for beating the game that calls back to one of their past games that came out before TERROR AT OAKHEART.  But outside of that.  This is very much a ONE AND DONE game. 

OVERALL ‚Äì

TERROR AT OAKHEART is a unique gameplay and take on a horror game that really does embrace the slasher aesthetics and feel of 80‚Äôs slasher flicks.  Though little replay is in this game. At the price of $8 (at time of review) This is a short and fun game that very much should be checked out for fans for horror.  It will make up jump, smile, and squirm as any good horror game should

8/10 Bloody hands from me.   Some flaws can make you get Amad and rage at it. But you hopefully will still enjoy the bloody path and story this game gives you. I for one hope for a TERROR AT OAKHEAT 2

Terror At Oakheart:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

The town of Oakheart has been on edge for quite some time; Teddy is on a killing rampage. He targets couples, and his killing methods are never the same but always gruesome. Teddy was always an odd fellow, working as an ice cream vendor dressed in a clown outfit with a strange mask, and walking awkwardly. But then something extraordinary corrupted his already weak mind; you know, the usual horrible extraterrestrial monster shooting some sort of membrane that sticks onto faces. It‚Äôs scary stuff. Is there more murder in sight, or will Teddy be stopped? If you want to know, then don't miss Terror At Oakheart.

Terror At Oakheart is a pixelated side-scroller survival horror game with a light puzzle element developed by Tainted Pact and published by Assemble Entertainment on the 24th of February 2024 on the Steam platform.

The game consists of nine chapters, including a prologue, and will take around three hours of gameplay to complete. Yes, it might be short, but what you get for the price point is excellent. As advertised, the game is heavily inspired by the horror movies of the 80s and 90s, and while playing the game, a few titles, such as Friday the 13th and Aliens, came to my mind. 
What impressed me in this game is the way the story is told, and the fact that you play every character. Yes, you'll play murderous Teddy, and you‚Äôll kill a few characters in his eccentric ways. But most of the time, you'll be playing characters who are about to die. For a couple of characters, you'll have to avoid being killed or it will be game over. Ultimately, the character you play the most will be the Sheriff of Oakheart. Most of the combat phases occur as the Sheriff.

Each chapter is based in specific locations, and the story will flow cleverly as you go along. The chapters/level are designed as corridors with doors that you have to explore. Some rooms will have items to collect, such as keys to open locked doors, ladders to reach a house's second floor, and various items you can use during your gameplay. The puzzles are straightforward and provide a bit of necessary variation in the gameplay, 

The combat phase is simplistic and suits the game very well. You‚Äôll experience most of the fighting as the sheriff, facing characters who have died and become pretty fun mutants, as well as a few different monsters created by the strange alien. They are not hard to kill - if they are too close to you and you need to reload your weapon, try exiting the room, reloading your weapon, and re-entering. The enemy will reappear on the other side of the screen, giving you plenty of time to shoot at them. The last boss is not hard to kill - it might take you a couple of goes until you understand its pattern, but when you get it, it will be straightforward. When you finish the game, you'll gain access to Mr. Top‚Äôs Killing Spree Mini-Game, which is fun and an additional bonus.  

The game runs well, and I like the eerie atmosphere it provides throughout the chapters with its dark areas and scary soundtracks. As the game is quite short and has one storyline, Terror at Oakheart doesn't offer much replayability, but it is really worth playing. 

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

+	Great pixel artwork and eerie soundtrack
+	An excellent story with nine chapters
+	The ability to play each character within the story
+	Good, simple combat phases
+	Simple puzzles to give more variety throughout your playthrough
+	Good price point
+	Achievements 

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	No trading cards as yet
-	A bit short

Although quite short, Terror At Oakheart is an excellent pixelated indie horror game that perfectly emulates the 80s and 90s movies of the genre.

28810,"This game is awesome! It is a love letter to slayers from the '80s and the '90s, especially Friday the 13th, The Thing, Halloween, and the Blob. It is a sci-fi/horror flick.

In gaming words, this is an action/adventure, horror game, side scroller. It has a couple of puzzles, but those are easy to solve, they don't require a lot of thinking, but the shooting does from time to time, because of the dodge mechanic and the relentless enemies you will face.

All in all, it is a fun indie game, buy it if you want to enjoy a good story like if you were back at the end of the XX century. Also, game time is around 2 hours, but those are a good couple of hours :)",1
28811,"Very good pixel slasher here. I played up to chapter 2. Very solid gameplay. The animations are nice and story elements while cliche still keep ya on ur toes. The atmosphere really sells it all. It's unfortunate that there is no voice acting. A common occurence with indie horror games. Despite this, the game is to be checked out. 

Gameplay Impressions: https://youtu.be/vLJsN1ve8nI",1
28812,"""I don't think I'm making it out of here. But I can at least leave a note for whoever comes here next.""

There's a lot to like about this game. The pixel graphics are very nicely done and the soundtrack is excellent. However, it suffers from very uneven pacing, confusion about what it wants to be, and some of the most godawful combat I've ever come across in a sidescroller - especially in the final ""boss"" segment of the game. 

Initially, the game appears to want to be a 2D walking sim type game with nods to slasher horror movies like Friday the 13th; you do a segment as the killer looking for your victims, then you play as the victims for a bit and wander around fetching items cluelessly until you meet the killer, who promptly butchers you in a comically excessive and grotesque death animation. You'll get cut in half, beheaded, crushed, hurled into a woodchipper - all the staples of b-movie murders - then the cycle repeats. The setting is classic horror fare - house during a power cut, isolated police station, and the ever-popular summer camp in the woods. The game wears its influences on its sleeve and that's totally fine. I didn't mind this part at all, though I could imagine some objecting that there are no choices to be made or much in the way of gameplay to be had - you just go left or right through doors until the bloody death scene happens. Personally I thought that this section was done competently enough if you're into that kind of thing; it looks and sounds good enough that if it'd had continued this way I'd have given a positive review.

Unfortunately, about 2/3 of the way in, suddenly the game has an identity crisis and wants to be a sidescrolling horror shooter instead with disastrous results. The atmosphere and pacing of the first hour are thrown out completely in favour of poorly-executed combat encounters. Your gunshots (and later your flamethrower) do little or no damage so you'll be running around left and right trying to create enough distance to get a shot off or reload constantly, even on basic enemies. The dodge doesn't work very well and unless your timing is absolutely perfect you'll take damage in most exchanges, even when you feel like you should be out of range or have gone in the opposite direction to the attack. It's clumsy and pads out the game excessively, with fights prolonged to about twice the length you'd actually want them to be. Despite these irritations, I thought I'd press on and see the story out, only to have things decline further. The final section is infuriatingly bad. You get two prolonged boss fights back to back with no checkpoint between them, lots of annoying added enemies all over the place snapping at your ankles while you're trying to concentrate, and not enough room to really fight back effectively. The difficulty spike here demands a level of mechanical mastery that no other part of the game requires with no build-up to speak of. I did beat it but it just feels so horribly out of place that it soured my already-shaky time spent with the game. I don't mind tough bosses in a combat-focused game with decent mechanics but this was just a messy and inappropriate ending to a game I previously felt well-disposed to. A shame.",0
28813,"So, while this is a game that I am recommending, it comes with the Caveat that the actual gameplay isn't that great. The main reason that you want to play it i because of the fact that it is basically a B horror movie in game form, and for that it is excellent. It is cheesy, it has some fun kills, some actually tense moments, and the plot is perfectly predictable in the way that if you watch a lot of horror movies you will know by the back of your hand. And if you play it looking for that, you'll probably have a good time.

However, if you're looking for puzzles, or for the survival horror sections you will not. Puzzles are basically just going around to find the thing that you need and the survival horror sections are plagued with clunky reloading mechanics, weird hitboxes that are just as exploitable as they are unpredictable, and enemies that are such bullet sponges that the fact that they are easy will not stop you from dying to them because you thought that your dodge had just one more I frame than you thought that it did. These sections, while they can be fun are also a pain to play as whenever you get forced into a fight and only offer you slightly faster movement but only if you get the movement right when not in combat.

All this isn't to say that the game isn't enjoyable, but it's short and about a third of the three hours I have comes from a combination of rough fights, and getting lost on a certain level in the game. I did enjoy it as a horror experience, but the game aspects need a lot of sanding off the rough edges. I do think that it is worth playing, but plenty of people will not and even for those who do it is probably better to pick it up on sale. I did enjoy looking for the plushies though, so take from that what you will.",1
28814,"It's been a slow season for good indie horror, and this was an absolute breath of fresh air during this time. 
The pixel art is fantastic, the gameplay is fun, and the story is fantastic. Really enjoyed basically every aspect of Terror at Oakheart.
Highly recommend for indie game lovers.",1

Note: I beat 100% of the game in 3.5 hours.",1
28816,"Absolutely loved this game. I'm a huge fan of classic horror films and this does a great job of paying homage to it. The music and story gave me total slasher vibes the entire time. The gameplay was fun, especially when playing as the killer. I personally would love to see another sequel to this pixel based game with this style. I'm really excited for what's next for Tainted Pact as I'm already looking forward to the next project ""Massacre at the Mirage"".",1

28818,"A nice little sidescroll horror story game with with a bit of action and adventure mechanics. But on a very small grade.
I feel about 8 bucks is a bit high for the very short time and the gameplay is not very deep. It's more like a 2D walking sim.
The story is also not very deep BUT it's art style and atmosphere is great. I would wait for a sale due to the lack of content and the fact that it is a linear story. But if you like unique atmosphere and want to support indie devs, go for it.
PS: The minigame that you unlock after the main story is kinda interesting but it feels very pointless. It would have been much better adding a bunch of different story path and decisions to make instead of creating a minigame where you have a clunky combat system and also just walk a linear path to the end.",1
28819,"I loved every aspect of this game, the 2D side scroller was right up my alley, I loved the story that unfolded as you played the game! It was very interesting, and pulled me in, wanting to find out more. I started to feel more invested, worried about the characters in the game. What a heckin' gem! So far all the games I've checked out from these devs have been nothing but amazing, keep up the good work! If anyone is interested in seeing some gameplay of the game, here's my experience! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylFS2Tq59Yg",1
28820,"What a wonderful treat this game this. Total love letter to the 80's/90/s slasher movies that were a big of part of my childhood/early teen years. The 2D pixel art is great, the story is perfect. The only thing wrong is the price..... IT'S TOO LOW, this is worth far more than the measly $8 the developers are asking for it. I'd go $15 for this easy. Hope it gets a sequel in the future because I want more of it!

28821,"This indie game is a true delight for all horror fans and I had a blast playing through it.  It's got your classic tropes, your awesome kills and a body count to die for!  I loved the pixel art style and the storytelling was awesome and played out as if you were watching an old 80's horror flick.  The music was on point and really helped to give it that perfect horror atmosphere.  One small suggestion would be to perhaps include some checkpoints so that if you need to leave the game for some reason that you don't have to then restart the entire chapter.

Highly recommend checking this one out if you're a fan of 80's slashers.  I'm sure you'll love all the little nods to your fav movies that the developer included.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from Tainted Pact in the future (keep up the great work)! ‚ô•",1
28822,"An excellent tribute to classic slasher films. A great story you would expect out of a game inspired by 80s films with hilariously over the top death scenes, retro art and amazing music. Definitely recommended if you enjoy those kinds of movies.",1
28823,"Clowns. Tentacles. Moist. Meaty. Gore.
All my favorite things wrapped neatly in a package of pixels and tied off with a lovely bow of gory kills. :)
Tainted Pact games did a fantastic job bringing us a 80's slasher retro nightmare with good storyline, captivating nostalgic graphics and A KILLER SOUNDTRACK.
I enjoyed the campy yet menacing feeling of the game and the characters were perfectly cliche. The gameplay was intriguing as you get to play as each character and witness them meet their fate at Teddy's hands! (Still mad about Max.) I also respect the homages to notable horror films and creative kills! I personally found the game only a bit dialogue heavy but I appreciate it was necessary for the game, I just get tired reading out loud >_<
Combat in game is pretty straight forward but still quite challenging (I don't wanna talk about how many tries it took me lol), be prepared for plenty of dodging, reloading and weapon cycling to beat these eldritch beings! Plenty of viscera and squishy Lovecraftian aesthetic. Watch out for tentacles!
Overall, I recommend that YOU PLAY THIS NOW. Honestly, I enjoyed the heck out of this game and the dev's work in general is top tier.
Also...I didn't break anything. 10/10!",1
28824,"Fun game which I enjoyed, took around 4 hours to complete.  You play as the killer and the victims, surviours.  If you like stuff like puppet combo you will more than likely like this.  Retro horror game with 80s slasher feel, try the demo if you liked that well than you will like this game.",1

28826,"(I received a free copy of this game from the devs)

A really well made game with little to no complaints on my end. The complaints I do have are not enough to warrant a bad review or things that should trigger buyer's remorse.

+Fantastic music that myself and viewers thoroughly enjoyed. It was genuinely great and several people had picked up on the 80s/90s vibe without knowing the game's description at all, so the aesthetic was fantastically transparent through art, concept, and music. 

+Decent story, nothing to absolutely write home about, but was still entertaining

+Enough puzzles, story, and other elements tied in that it's a good balance of mechanics

-Playing as the killer felt too comical and took away from the horror aspect, but the kills were really brutal and fun to watch.

-There's a few grammatical errors within the game, namely within the beginning. 

-Combat mechanics can feel clunky and unfair at times, but nothing game breaking or impossible to move past. It offered a nice challenge to myself, personally. 

Overall, the game is well worth the asking price and is something to actually play and enjoy without things being overly complicated and long-winded.",1
28827,"Everything good until the [spoiler] final chapter. I completed the first mini boss, then went to the next. After a couple tries  I got all the tentacles and turned the valve or whatever, then it wanted me to repeat the process. I died, did it again, died around the same spot, did it again, kept on dying. Then I accidentally returned to main menu instead of reload to checkpoint. From the main menu you can only select which chapter, and not continue from last checkpoint. Not even going to try to repeat that chapter. Watched the ending on YouTube. [/spoiler] Additionally, I didn't like how often you play as the killer. It's not scary at all when you do the killing, it still is cool but, you can still better experience that when you are the person being killed. I would give this game a thumbs down because of the [spoiler] final chapter [/spoiler] but the rest of the game is great. Some things are similar to suffer the night.",1
28828,"Really dull, moving from left-to-right, trying to find the right door to progress through the story and if you take the wrong path, you die, reload and then do the right path.",0
28829,"I had a lot of fun with this game right up until the final 'boss' fight which took me FAR longer than I'm willing to admit to beat and which felt like such a departure from how the game had played out before. It just didn't fit with the story-telling/narrative driven nature of the game up until then. All of a sudden it turned into an intense shooter/combat game?! And I swear the AI cheats. Yes, I'm still salty. Anyway, if you disregard all of that which was in reality a very small portion of the game, I loved it. The art style was great and allowed for more gory, gruesome deaths which a horror/slasher fan like myself loves. The nods to classic slasher horror movies was appreciated. The story-line was predictable but fun - I always enjoy deciding if I like a character or not and trying to figure out how they'll die in slasher films. If you're a fan of the 90's slasher horror flicks I guarantee you'll have a good time with this game. You can watch my full play-through and review over on my YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/pZvG5_aS42U. Thanks to the dev for the key and the opportunity to play this game for my audience!",1
28830,Amazing game highly recommend for any slasher fan man really loved it ! really hope they make a sequel .,1
28831,"Short fun and murderous game. I wish it was longer but I am content with my purchase. I enjoy the mechanics of playing different characters. I truly got a little stress and anxiety from fear a couple times which is great for a horror based game. Still very reminiscent of OG pixel point and click adventure games. Do not expect this to be some outrageous masterpiece, however, it is good for its genre and niche.",1
28832,"Disappointing. Story lacks creativity and the gameplay consists mostly of walking with your current character down their linear path, maybe pick up an item on your way, until Teddy kills them. Sometimes it's reversed and you walk Teddy down his linear path until he kills them instead. It's always very obvious and offers no surprises. It doesn't get scary, because for that you'd need the feeling you could do something wrong or at least a bit of hope for survival. Here, you get ""guess we'll kill this person I've never seen before off now"", next.

That's until you get to one of the characters who can actually use a weapon to defend himself at which point the game turns into bothersome run and gun, except you're not running. Combat is tedious and cumbersome and becomes annoying really quickly. When you've had enough and think you'll stop for today and play on later ... think again, because you cannot continue from checkpoints when you leave the game, only restart whole chapters. Poor.

The music and visuals are good, though. The actual game not so much.",0
28833,"As though this game feels and has visuals like a Super Nintendo Console, it feels very linear when it comes to gameplay. Story is straightforward where you play as a serial killer, who is a clown, working with an evil entity to feed it flesh. It has simple puzzles to do in order to progress to the next parts of the game. It does have a cheesy classical horror theme going for it, yet it doesn't help from its linear gameplay. Though the game did have some enjoyable death animations, which are the only interesting visuals that made this appealing. There is some combat, but its not too difficult and some of the hit boxes from dodging requires a bit of timing. Overall, its a horror game with the SNES theme going for it just not highly recommended.",0
28834,"I love the game but I didn't finish it because of the worst part at the end, which is soooo long and does not really fit into the game. I don't want to spoiler what happens, but the last chapter is really bad, for me personally and I this is why I would give the game a neutral if this would have been possible.
Apart from this it feels like a horrormovie and I had a good time until this point of the game.",1
28835,"I really liked this game after watching Insym stream this, I was 100% interested.

The Story is your typical 80s slasher movie but you see the killer side of things aswell. The gameplay is very simple but however there is more to it then you might think. For it's price, I think it's a good price point for how short the game is.",1
28836,"Really fun and charming, bursting with great nods to classic slashers all over the place in superb pixel art form. The music gets a little bit repetetive for my taste though, and there's a significant difficulty spike by the final chapter. I'm still struggling with it. I'm not a huge fan of the placement of the save points, especially considering how tough some of the later fights are, and the fact the collected inventory items such as med kits vanishes by chapter progression was a frustrating realisation. It's a great game though full of love for the genre.",1
28837,"Short little slasher horror game. Obviously an homage to 80's and 90's slashers, which I like.

The combat is functional but lackluster and can get on your nerve as the game progresses. The story is just that of a slasher, and doesn't really innovate too much. The kills are great (and if you know your horror movies, you can see some really on-point callbacks).

I enjoyed it for what it was.",1
28838,"A Jason-esque eldritch slashing experience. Glory kills, giant tentacles, and challenging end bosses that let you play out an 80s horror flick to a T.",1
28839,"This game was very fun. I loved the music, atmosphere, pixel graphics. Had me laughing and also disturbed at some parts haha Great slasher horror game. If you love 80s horror movies, you'll enjoy this game.",1
28840,"One of my absolute favorite games ever made!
The whole game is homage to old school slasher films which to me, that's fantastic,
Especially once you start to get the movie correlations!
Its mostly a relaxed and scary game but as each level that goes by, it becomes more challenging and involved.
The whole environment is super immersive as well, especially for a retro style game.

Don't think too hard about purchasing this game, if you liked the trailer, you'll like this game. 
4.8/5 rating (imo)",1
28841,"Absolutely worth a buy.  A fun little horror story with very good pixel art.  It's not a huge amount of puzzle solving or combat but kind of just rolls along.  A few collectibles and another game mode to keep you busy if you want something more after the games over.  This dev is great at making digestible horror experiences, I notoriously don't finish games but theirs always hit the sweet spot of keeping me engaged till the conclusion..  Very much enjoyed one of their other games Suffer the Night.

Very odd nitpick, some of the people (I believe it was mostly male chars) have a weird jump in the light area on the lower half of their shirt.  The highlighted area jumps from 2px to 3px from an eyeballs glance, it causes a kind of visual stutter.  Overall artistically loved the setpieces otherwise.",1
28842,"So, I LOVED Suffer The Night. I think it was one of my favorite games from last year and I played ALOT of them. This one, doesn't fit that same mold but really did scratch that retro style 80s horror itch I've been craving. The story is barebones basic but nothing wrong with that being inspired by the good old slashers of the time. 

Fits right in with what it was going for. I enjoyed it especially the story.",1
28843,"Excellent game! 

Gorgeous aesthetic and pixel art, the story is very interesting, the music is good, straight forward gameplay, easy to play.

Definitely recommended, gonna check out other projects by the devs.  
",1
28844,"Overall I recommend this game.

The atmosphere is great and reminds of old SNES games. Graphics, sound, gameplay, controls...all of it has the retro vibe. Horror fans should try it out in my opinion. It isn't too innovative, but that is not necessary or bad. Horror fans with a spleen for gore probably enjoy it exactly like this.

I liked the boss fights as well. They had a bit of a Secret of Evermore touch (boss is not directly attackable, so work around).

The only negative thing I want to point out: I played for 2.7 hours and basically unlocked all achievements including finishing the bonus minigame. So the content is not too much and some people might think the price is a bit too high for this.

For me personally the price was ok, I had good fun for roughly 3 hours. Others might think different.",1
28845,"Very cool little sidescroller horror game. Its gameplay is rather simple, at first consisting of merely walking and interacting, but gradually combat comes into focus. It's solidly executed mechanics-wise, however the real stars are the visuals, sound design and atmosphere. It's a neat concept and story turned into a treat for fans of retro and throwback horror. If you enjoyed Happyhills Homicide, for example, this one will be right up your alley.",1
28846,"this was a fun game, and with great story! I also loved how it was short and sweet as well.

my only gripes were this, and they're very minor

A} no health bar
B} no ammo count",1
28847,"This game is the perfect blend of 16 bit retro side-scrollers, classic slasher films, and eldritch horror. The story is entertaining and interesting, the pacing is good, there's just enough room to explore and find goodies without it feeling tedious, the dialogue is light and fun but every character is distinct, and the combat is challenging but not overwhelming. I highly recommend this game to horror fans, retro fans, and anyone who just enjoys fun. 
Tainted Pact continues to deliver quality, unique, interesting, entertaining and accessible indie horror games.",1
28848,"It's Terrifier meets Thimbleweed Park. 

A couple levels in I thought it was ""just"" a sidescroller, but then I got to shoot things! Very straightforward levels with just the right amount of horror movie references. 

I love it, especially the soundtrack.",1
28849,"If you're looking for a fun, short, campy NES style horror game then this is good choice. The combat can be very frustrating at times because of the inability to dodge while reloading and sometimes unfair feeling hitboxes. Though maybe it's just a throwback to a more frustrating age of gaming!

Buy it on sale if you want but 10 bucks isn't too bad.",1
28850,"I loved the pixel graphics, 80‚Äôs slasher vibe, and very exciting gameplay! The story was great! I hope there is a sequel.

 My only gripes would be to make the checkpoints a little closer together, and the option to skip the cutscenes after you seen them, so if you die, you don‚Äôt have to repeat the same cutscene over and over. 

But overall, I think it was a great experience, and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been excited about playing a game in a long time. I was counting the days to its release!",1
28851,"Played today and absolutely loved it!

I feel like if the Friday the 13th movie and The Thing movie had a baby, it would be this game.

Style was fantastic, soundtrack was awesome, story was so much fun and the gameplay was great!

A health icon would be nice but apart from that, it blew my expectations away!",1
28852,"""Fish on the Desktop"" is not just a game; it's a transformative experience that has undeniably enriched my life. From the moment I first launched the game, I was captivated by its simplicity and charm. The serene underwater world that my desktop screen is able to create with the fish living on it is a testament to the game's ability to transport players to a tranquil realm, providing a much-needed escape from the stresses of everyday life. As I navigated through the virtual aquatic environment, I found myself immersed in the calming ambiance, surrounded by vibrant marine life and soothing fish swimming on my desktop. The game's intuitive mechanics and engaging ""gameplay"" allowed me to unwind and embrace a sense of mindfulness. ""Fish on the Desktop"" became my sanctuary, a place where I could momentarily detach from the hustle and bustle of the real world. Beyond its entertainment value, the game subtly instilled a sense of responsibility and environmental awareness. Caring for the virtual fish in their habitat mirrored the importance of nurturing and preserving our own planet. This newfound perspective translated into my daily life, encouraging me to be more conscious of my ecological footprint. In essence, ""Fish on the Desktop"" transcended the boundaries of a mere game, becoming a catalyst for positive change in my life. It serves as a reminder that even in the virtual realms, simple pleasures and mindful interactions can have a profound impact, ultimately contributing to a better, more balanced existence.

Thank you.",1

I feel truly enlightened by this wonderful addition to my games collection, and I shall cherish each and every single moment that I get to play this fine wine of a game.

My life has not been the same since the day I downloaded this work of art onto my computer. These fish have made me a better man. A kinder and gentler person. They've brought me closer to God. I love each individual fish like a child. Watching these beautiful creatures swim around my computer, I feel as though everything will be alright. I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's a way out of all the madness of modern life. In a word, I feel at peace. There are no downsides to installing this beautiful breath of life into an otherwise dull world.

28863,"There is really a lot to say about this game. I was gifted this a few months back, however did not launch it until about a month after that initial date. At the time I was naive. The fish were amusing! Fun! Entertaining! Trying to complete schoolwork and other things with these fish was great. However, the achievements changed me. After I reached that sweet 100% completion, I searched for other goals. The leader board. That damned leader board. I wanted to know how far it went. How deep the rabbit hole would go. 

It was fun at first, trying to figure out that optimal strategy to get the absolute most out of these fish. After a week it became my life. Taking care of hundreds of sharks just to gain a bit more on the leader board. 

One thing i'm annoyed about is the lack of anti cheat, or any purging of the leader boards. While this game is fine without it, everyone past rank 8 on the leader board has cheated. Why? Wheres the fun in cheating your way to the top, never experiencing what fish on your desktop really does to you. The sharks. The barracudas. They speak in riddles. To all who consider hacking on this game, I hope whatever fish god lies above curses you to an eternity of fish hell.

I'm going to quote the store page and then respond to each bullet point; this is what's advertised:
[list]
Game features:
[*]Unusual visual style
[*]Mysterious story
[*]Short duration (10-15 minutes)
[/list]
[list]
[*][i]Unusual visual style[/i] Is it though? You can watch for yourself in the video on the store page, it's not that unusual just old. (which would be fine, I don't care that it looks like it's from 1999, but it's not unusual)
[*][i]Mysterious story[/i] Did you watch the video on the store page? Because that's it, that's the entire mystery. You've watched the entire mystery ~ there is no ending within ""this"" game, that would be the next one (that doesn't exist) after this ""prologue""
[*][i]Short duration (10-15 minutes)[/i] ~ They claim 10-15 minutes, personally it took me 6 and that includes solving the ""puzzle"" that gets you the achievement. I suppose if you read really, really slow and have a difficult time clicking on 1 of 6 boxes it might take you substantially longer than 6 minutes.
[/list]
More to the point let me make it clear this game doesn't innovate or have any deep game play. It's a very straight forward visual novel that you read and make a couple of ""choose your own adventure"" style choices that have no effect on the outcome. Aside from clicking on a couple of folders to ""solve"" a puzzle (that is so easy I have a hard time calling it a puzzle‚Ä¶) you're just reading/listening to dialogue and answering a couple of irrelevant questions before being told ""this is a mystery"" which I suppose is the hook to get you to buy their next game? (which doesn't exist yet? if ever?)

Look, the game isn't even long enough for me to hate it. If this was free I'd be telling everyone to download it and get a free achievement while maybe being mildly curious what their next game would be.

But it's $1 and it has basically no content aside from a few minute long commercial for another product that doesn't even exist yet.

How am I supposed to recommend this?

Watch the video on the store page, it's 1 minute long. If you want to see 5 more minutes of that same screen while that character keeps talking and gives you no additional information, then go ahead and donate $1 to this developer by buying it.
---

Bottom line: This wants to set itself up as a mystery, but there's not enough content to even engage with.

You are an AI that seemingly lost its memories, theres a lot of bugs, lost data, and broken files, digging deeper it looks like all of it wasnt an accident. The visuals are crunchy and nice, the character is animated, which I didnt expect, (only looked at the screenshots.)

Nothing bad to say here, Im interested and look forward to see more of it, given this is only the prologue.

Thank you C-14, for providing me with a copy, much appreciated!

28905,"Story wise, I can't piece very much, but on the other hand, the theme, the overall aesthetic it was aiming for is somewhat well executed. Creepy and mysterious vibes complemented by a rather simplistic layout of things. Not half bad for a short point and click game, definitely would like to know more about the story.",1
28906,"Short visual novel that would be worth expanding.

The presentation is what draws you in. You assume the role of an AI in charge of keeping everything in order. But then something unusual happens, and the boss wants to know what happened. 

Everything happens on a computer screen, however the gameplay is extremely constrained. When the boss asks a question, you're able to respond by selecting one of the options. The three desktop icons might suggest freedom, but they only function when the boss instructs you to click on them. In any case, there's not much to see in there because most of it displays an error message.

The whole game can be finished during your lunch break.",1
28907,"Non-branching visual novel followed by the laziest Windows 95 interactive facsimile ever.  The game screenshots above literally show ever single bit of ""gameplay"" that this offers. I'm not sure how I got this game, probably as part of bundle, but the remote possibility that I paid 99 cents for this garbage makes me feel slightly ill. I love retro gaming and retro styled gaming and yet could find zero redeeming content here.",0
28908,"[b]I'd be disappointed if I paid for this as it stands. [/b]It's *very* short, but I was actually hooked by the end of the 14 minutes.  I liked the old-school graphics.

It kind of thrusts you into the hot seat of a story that's already in motion.  That threw me off at first, but I felt like it just started getting good when the prologue ends! It's a bittersweet feeling. 

This review is somewhat given in good faith:  I genuinely think this could be a cool project if it's as intriguing as the last 30 seconds were.  Don't buy the prologue at $0.99 though.  It's too short.

One QoL thing that I'd like to see is the dialogue immediately progressing when you choose what to say: As it is, you click a dialogue option and then have to click again to hear the next line. I'm not sure if that's intended, but I found it strange.",1
28909,"I will preface this by saying that this game is complete trash.  It's not playable by any means. 
I will also state that being a fellow game developer, using assets that you did not purchase the rights to is illegal to do. I saw assets used in other war games as well as music that is not copyright (or royalty) free.

The game's current reviews are fake and do not actually reflect the game itself or its gameplay.  They are reviews from the artists and generally fake to help bolster its overall score. 

So, onto the review of the game itself...

The game is made using Unity (A free version) as the intro slate suggests.

The menu is not properly play-tested and broken from the get-go.  If I navigate to an exit window, and decide to hit ""cancel"", I am brought back to the main menu but now no longer able to proceed forward into the game, it just stuck in a loop forever.

Okay, so I close and re-open the game.  I go to start to play the game, I keep trying to click to start the game, it errors out over and over again, after about 20 clicks I'm finally able to proceed into the next menu which allows to (once again play the game, or play a tutorial.  I go to click on to play the game, I am then FORCED to consume a tutorial which is nothing more than a huge ""power point"" style presentation about ""how awesome this game will be"" and doesn't provide any sustenance as to what the game actually is!

And this leads me to another big point.  I checked out this game also on youtube as well as its incredibly failed kickstarter and nowhere anywhere in any social media platform does the creator of this game actually TELL you what this game is about in a concise way.  The creator just goes on and on and on and on about things.  Things that don't hook up or make sense or tell about what the game is or the game's actual gameplay or the point or objective.  That is a crucial game design mechanic.  You can't have a game if you don't know what it is, or could tell someone what it is.  For example, take StarCraft, in one sentence I can tell you what it is: ""It's a realtime strategy game about three opposing forces all wanting the same goal.""  However ""WARZOOM"" I have absolutely NO idea what it's about but apparently the creator says there's expansions (which you have to pay for?)

So when I finally get to playing the game, guess what? I can't play it after all BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE.  So this entire ""Game"" is just one big presentation thing? I don't think this qualifies as Steam content, let alone a game.

I just don't get why this exists and why the creator reveres this mess? Apparently as he quotes, ""WARZOOM created in 1987 became a hit board game. WARZOOM is now coming to PC, Laptop, Tablet and Smart Phone."" I have literally found nothing about that.  Anywhere. Warzoom doesn't exist in the real world other than in this guy's head and maybe a friend or two he might know.  Where's the hit? where's the awards? Where actual GAME. There's absolutely nothing. That's called lying sir, it's deceitful and it's scummy.

The fact that this game is offering in-game payments for content that doesn't exist is a huge violation of Steam standards. On top of the stolen assets.  On top of the lying.  On top of the fake reviews.  On top of it not even being a playable game.

You sir need to really re-evaluate yourself and your efforts if you think this is some ""BIG HIT"" with nothing to show for it.

I'll be following up with Steam to flag this content as fake / scam content.",0
28910,"As an avid strategy gamer I was looking for something new and casual to play and I cam across Warzoom.

It's hard to even call this a game. What it actually seems to be is a power point presentation explaining the rules and how exciting and cool this game is and a vehicle to sell skins from 99c to $2.99

It talks about being a conversion from the hit board game warzoom. I'm an avid board game collector (and nerd) Warzoom was a French made WW2 skirmish rule set for miniatures released by Aron Clement in 2012. This is not that game, and the actual game called warzoom was far far from being a hit. 

The splash screens appear to be artwork from other games . After a quick google search the images used on all of the splash screens are taken directly from War Thunder. 

I'm not surprised that the artist who supposedly worked on this project has disabled comments to their game review and put their profile on private. I would imagine if Gaijin Entertainment somehow find this it will be copyright struck immediately. 

There is no solo mode, apparently its ""coming soon""

The game lobby is empty so no multiplayer

This just seems to be a vehicle to sell skins for 99 cents to $2.99 each. 

I read the positive reviews and I'm not sure how they could have written anything positive at all - there is nothing to play.


The characters and skins you can ""play"" appear to be pre made assests

I'm just confused as to how and why this is even on steam, all that seems to work is the buy a skin option.

Don't even waste your bandwidth or disk space to download this, its completely pointless. Unless you want to buy skins for a game that appears not to exist.

The publisher / dev team have used assets ripped directly from a popular video game. Used a name from a game they obviously do not own. Then claimed that warzoom is from the hit board game. 

I don't know for sure if this game is a purposeful scam or a game made by kids who don't know any better.",0
28911,"‚†ÄAlright I just want to state one thing about this game, I've met the founder of the game and I can say certainly that they are not a game developer and had no idea what they we're doing and just hired a talented artist and unity devs, but extremely limited them in what they were allowed to do for the project. I've met the artist for this game and they were not given much creative control at all on this project and they themselves have confirmed to me that any reused assets from other games were not decisions made by them, but simply didn't have much of a say in that matter due to how protective and controlling the founder is. Also I heard the founder saying some unhinged stuff like trashing on the poor and wanting to move to Canada because of immigrants and saying crazy things like ""the downfall of america is among us"", just out of the blue. He also insulted me when I attempted to help him with his game and I criticized aspects of his game. From what I saw as someone who was potentially going to be a developer the project was doomed from the start due to the fact that the owner of the project was too controlling and proud to take any advice from anyone.

28919,"Let me start by saying I can see the bones of a fun and ambitious game. It feels like there's a decent scale. I like the idea of the content. Ship battles are an interesting change of pace.

Unfortunately, the gameplay itself just isn't engaging. The first hour or so consists of fighting the same few enemies with one or two variations depending on planet type. The combat is the typical RPGMaker basic attack or skill. There is the option to auto battle BUT if the enemy uses their ""special"" attack, it plays a looping animation indefinitely (one ran for 4 minutes while I grabbed a snack). The only way to end the animation is with the same button which ends the auto battle. You do have the ability to turn off battle animations, it doesn't apply to the loops. I couldn't make it through the tedium.",0

If not then I don't recommend this game.",1

28922,"Easy to play but has a pokemon type feel of enjoyability. You are limited to a combat team of 2 but can swap out at any time. (Acutally a team of 3 after you beat the 3rd galaxy)

Your womb is a pokeball though you can also use your breasts as a second womb. There are a few humans you can recruit after meeting certain criteria if you don't ever want to engage in the breeding.

There is also space combat minigames which is quite fun. Has a Faster Than Light feel to it.


There is crafting and mining. I got tricked into being a futa so hopefully I can revert soon. (Turns out, you can disable the futa in key items in the inventory)


Although there are grindy parts to it, you actually can find ways to not have to grind it. But it's not apparent on a blind play through unless you TRUST that the dev isn't some sadistic korean mmorpg developer with no shortcuts in mind.",1
28923,"First of all I had fun for the first 4 ours then I just hoped to discover new content, it did not happened. You can stop the game after galaxy 3.

I hope to see major updates because it can be a huge lewd game !",0

Some areas are big and expansive for seemly no other reason than to waste my time.
I really loved the first few hours but its just too much repetition.
Might pick Para Ark back up at one point or another but for now I just feel burned out thinking about getting on and deciding not to since I have a very good feeling i'm just going to be doing the same things again just with a different mission or object to find.
However I hear good things about the pacing of Worm Nest so i'm gonna happily give it a try and I encourage the devs to stride forward as I'm really happy with most of the game play loop.

Honestly in deeper thought the value i'd gotten from the early hours was definitely worth $6.99 and based on that I would recommend others to play Para Ark.

Maybe I haven't gotten into the goods yet, I left on universe 6 with a decent amount more to go, its just after universe 4 I felt like I was just getting bored.",1

I loved playing the game and it deserve's  continu game or a part 2, i also loved the farming and battle.

my only pointer is when i was playing the game from the gear and materiaals i crafted and collected i could only equip wapons and devices and by the children only modules from all the availebel slots, would have loved to use the other slots also. plus would have been nice to put on diverent space suits.",1

28933,"The images to promote the game are basically from the end of the game. If you play it in a way you mate with every girl to get a daughter but forgot to make harvest ultimate it will take longer than just making harvest ultimate to get resources.

Now if you want a sex game yeah you can do it all in like 3 hours then lose at the end. Yes 27 hours of grinding to get what is needed to defeat the final boss due to me not knowing 1 game mechanic. Now if i did now that 1 thing i probably would have won before now saw the ending video in the game.",1

+You can birth the in-game equivalent of either pokemon and Rare Candies.

28936,"Decent game for the price. Took me 16 hours to 100% it, though i felt cheated at the end because it unlocked the cheat menu after i beat the final boss so i could have skipped quite a bit of grinding those last rare monsters out.

If the dev makes a sequel, i would totally buy it.",1

H-scenes are decent, would fap if u have insect fetish or even more degenerate.

There isn't alot of people giving this game a worthy review basically because it's weird to have this game in the library (thanks steam for hidden game feature) let alone posting a review, I want to live in a world where every game, even if it's very controversy or very weirdly degenrated, people buying them won't get called ""creep"" or ""weirdo"", it's just a game.",1

You would like this game if you likes Monster Girls, Interspecies Breeding, Bestiality and Incest.
The game are a bit tedious around the early game but once you get to certain points, it become easier and easier each points.
You can even play with one hand! You can use mouse to move and use skills. Right click to open menu and cancel. Scroll mouse available too.

This game feeds into my fetishes, Monster Girls and Incest.  I have a save file that have every playable characters pregnant by Sasha (the player character). Sasha is also x3 pregnant.
Flame Dragon Daughter is my favorite girl. She's gorgeous, big and tall, and her belly is huge when she's pregnant and her tits got bigger! I keep impregnating her with Sasha as soon as she available to get pregnant again.
And then I crossbreed her with the Xenomorph and now I have 2, TWO Dragon Girls that I proceed to take her virginity and impregnate her immediately as Sasha. 
""Sasha has impregnated her granddaughter which is a result of her 2 daughters having sex.""  Oh my goodness gracious! (moan)
Sea Snake Daughter is my second favorite girl and so is her daughter. A crossbreed of Sea Snake and Mosky.
Bullcorser is my 3rd favorite because she have the biggest D I C K of all playable characters.
Note that when I get to the point that turn Sasha into a Futanari. I make Sasha took the virginity and impregnate every daughters (and granddaughter of crossbreeding) she have after she become a Futanari.
Note 2 - When the character is born, they become adult immediately so there are non of that...you know...sex the [redacted]...
Note 3 - The game set that the girls beside Sasha will give birth faster if they got creampie. I didn't count on how many times for the animals/monster to creampie them to accelerate it to the point of them giving birth but [b]it take Sasha 2 times to creampie them and they will give birth immediately.[/b] I can just sit there and keep creampie-ing them and when they give birth, I just impregnate them again and again and again while I was waiting for something like resource mining.
God, I wish I were Sasha (Futanari). Isekai me there and I will have sex with every lifeform I found and make a hybrid of them and then I'll take my daughters virginity and impregnate them immediately.  Life full of sex!",1

I've played a few rounds and I just want to keep replaying and seeing how far I can go. I can't wait for this game to grow and evolve too, it's already so much fun.",1
28971,"Simple game where you save chickens from predators.

You begin by selecting your guardian. While gorillas have more health and geese have greater speed, cats provide the most balanced gaming because all of their stats are equal. The gathering radius, which attracts chickens towards you, is roughly the same for everyone.

Then you pick the stage you want to play. Only woodlands is available at first, the rest are unlocked as you beat stages. These are fun, and contain elements to make them unique. Stages are the most interesting feature because the main gameplay doesn't change much and can become repetitive.

The goal is to run around and gather chickens that spawn at random spots. They will begin to follow you as you get closer, and there is no limit to how many you can have. Chickens come in three sizes. The largest is the slowest, but you can carry one in your mouth. There are chicken coops on both sides of the map. When a chicken is delivered there, you earn both money and time. Time is always running out, and you must continue to acquire chicks in order to survive.

Other animals such as foxes and wolves will hunt you. If you have chickens, they will stop rushing after you and eat one of them. You can get rid of predators by purchasing powerups. The most entertaining is the one where you give each of your chickens a rifle or laser. The shop can be opened at any moment, and money transfers between runs, so you don't have to spend everything in a single run. 

Dead predators drop a golden egg. This feature is currently broken; the game crashes when you grab two eggs.",1

Some of the design of the game is extremely good, like the fact that this game is played exclusively using one hand, unironically... (the only controls are w, a, s, d, q, e and space) it's such a great detail.

It took me 10 hours to 100% the game, and i enjoyed every minute of it. Worth the price.

PS: part of me is making this review just to make it appear in my friends reccomendations because steam does that ;D
I also played this game before playing the original vampire survivors, i like this game more.",1
28977,"(Before I say anything else, I'd like to point out that the game has no nudity, nothing really NSFW, and no sex, which makes me wonder if there's an 18+ patch on some niche site somewhere where the dev's hiding it from Steam...?)

Game's pretty cool, though really simple, I hope there's plans to flesh this out in further updates.
Basically, it's another one of those bullet heaven games, but there's a roguelite map progression mechanic for some reason (though TBH it doesn't really add much to the game.)

The transformation potions mentioned in the game's store page are basically ""classes"" you advance by drinking more of said potion, and the more you drink, the more active and passive skills you can unlock.
Big breasts- explosions and AoE
Small breasts- single target attacks and speed
Corruption- IDK, there's a bunch of damage over time stuff?
Muscles- physical/melee + crit. (Kinda jack of all trades, I wish it was a tank build or that there was more of a focus on close range or something.)
""Beast"" (catgirl)- summons
Hips- ...more AoE, I guess?

Anyway, each potion DOES affect the character's appearance a bit, though most are WAY too subtle until the meter maxes out and you evolve.
Kinda grumpy how little the BE potion changes her size until the meter maxes out in particular, and even her maxed size isn't THAT much bigger. The beast potion adds a tail and little cat ears as the meter fills, and the corruption potion gets horns.
Basically what I'm getting at here is the breast potions, the hip and muscle potions, they're all super weak visually, the dev/artist barely touched the character, probably didn't want to have to redraw anything, I guess.

Still, it's a pretty generic bullet heaven / action-roguelite / Vampire-like / horde battler, and the transformation mechanic isn't really enough to make the game particularly unique, though the price helps.
The game's short too, out of the 2 hours I played this so far, I only really actively played it for about an hour, I left my PC running, and in that hour I've beaten two of the three difficulties and only failed three times, two due to terrible RNG and once due to me disliking my build.

IDK, the game's okay, but pretty middling, my feelings for the game are so-so and will entirely depend on when/if the dev does some balancing and content updates.",1
28978,"7/10
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the screenshots, this is not in fact a H-game. It does contain some suggestive art, but it‚Äôs there for the purpose of giving the game some flavour, instead of being the whole point of it.

What you are actually dealing with here is an entertaining little entry of the auto shooter genre spearheaded originally by Vampire Survivors. The core gameplay in Wedding Witch doesn‚Äôt differ that much from other games of the genre, but it does make some changes to spice up the usual formulae.
In my opinion the most interesting change is splitting a run into multiple shorter sequences. After each level you are able to select a body upgrade which will extend the number options in the weapon/upgrade pool. This helps somewhat limit the annoying RNG factor often plaguing the genre, and allows the player to plan ahead their build in the beginning of the run based on how the upgrades are scattered across the levels.

If I had to criticise one thing about the game, it would be the lack of polish which is holding the game back in some areas. A prime example of the rough edges is the build balance, which could definitely use some improvements. One of the available build types is unfortunately so underpowered that it‚Äôs borderline unplayable. 

I must admit that I originally bought the game to laugh at some anime t*ddies, but ended up staying for the gameplay. I have played quite a few games of the genre, and gameplay wise this one is far from the worst ones I have tried. The movement and hitboxes are tight enough to make the action and projectile dodging feel satisfying for hours.

Regarding the art I feel obligated to reinstate that it‚Äôs good, but not all that lewd, nor is there that much of it actually in the game (I wish there was more). But I‚Äôd wager that as long as you are not expecting to get a full blown H-game and have at least a little interest in the auto shooter genre, you are bound to have a decent time with this one. Beating the available content and grabbing all the achievements takes around 7-10 hours in total, which to me felt like the ideal completion time for this particular game.",1
28979,"The sexy and light version of Vampire Survivors. Honestly the artstyle is pretty cute and the game is fun even though it's short. I would buy a DLC for more optional characters, levels or whatever 10/10 for that little money you can't go wrong!

- Finally a game that promotes little boobs!",1
28980,To me transformation fetish material has always seemed like it would go well with gaming's inherent structures of character builds and upgrades. Wedding witch is an attempt to do that within the auto attack arena rouge-lite genre yet falls short. I think the biggest issue here is the lack of synergy. Beyond each fetish having its own magic there is no combination upgrades like in VS and there is no way to really mix and match fetish forms. You cant be a buff cat girl or a gyatted up mindless succubus. It makes the actual character building really mindless and limits the coom appeal. In general The sexual content here is vastly overstated which I blame on steam's tag and adult contend ID system. You get at most the slightly ecchi art of your girl in between levels and a single static image at the end based on your form. Even if they didnt want to add more physical drawings or explictly lewd content some saucy text descriptions could have easily improved the sexual content for those into transformation and mind control/hypno.,0

Will you choose to walk the familiar path of breasts VS butt and I will be quoting Confucius here: ""big tits and no ass will fill your hands, but big ass and no tits will fill your heart.""
Or will you choose perdition through breast reduction and yiffing.
There's also a corruption path that makes the Witch looks like Albedo from the popular anime Overlord („Ç™„Éº„Éê„Éº„É≠„Éº„Éâ), which is fine in my book. Finally, there is the deep, harduous and soul searching path of the muscle girl enjoyer. A Path that start with ecchi and invariably end with yaoi.",1
28984,"[b]TL;DR[/b]
+ Witch is cute, all transformations are very appropriate
+ End-state gameplay is a lot of fun
+ Abilities are all super fun (although Melee felt lackluster to me, I'm not sure if that's just me)
+ High replay value
- No gallery mode :c
- Game doesn't differentiate between death vs. game closed and resets all runs regardless, making crashes intensely annoying
- A little too grind heavy
- Higher difficulties don't really feel worth it
-----------------------------------------

[h1]--- Overview ---[/h1]
A Vampire Survivors-like game containing a cute Witch preparing for her wedding with a normal human male by taking it upon herself to prepare for her first night with him by altering herself so that mayhaps he will like her more! With three difficulties to take on and several end-cards to see, there is a lot of replayability here!

[h1]--- The LEWDS ---[/h1]
As your witch consumes potions, she gains minor traits related to that potion. When she maxes out any transformation bar, she will take on traits heavily associated with that potion and her body will change appropriately. Note that if you max out any bar after you've maxed out your first, it will not change anything.

After you complete the game, you get an image of the girl in her end-game state (whether she is normal from never maxing out a potion or she has maxed out a potion and is transformed). Unfortunately, there is no gallery associated with this, so if you want to get a screenshot of a transformation you missed, you'll have to replay about 15-20 minutes to get to that point again.

There is no nudity of any kind, only erotic designs associated with her appearance. Aside from that, there is also no lewd element to the gameplay of any kind, the only erotic element of the game is in the appearance of the witch.

[h1]--- Gameplay Overview ---[/h1]
You run around with arrow keys/WASD controls with an auto-attack going that auto-homes onto an enemy and that enemy will drop experience points. Collecting those allows you to level up mid-fight, enabling you to become stronger or unlock certain abilities. At the end of each stage, you're given the ability to consume a certain potion. That potion not only changes the appearance of the witch slightly, but also unlocks the ability to obtain new skills when you further level up.

Dying at any point means you start over from 0, but this also means that if the game crashes (as it did for me a few times) or if you need to leave for any reason, the game doesn't save your progress as it doesn't distinguish between death or game closing, so you lose your progress in that current session.

Around the maps are also pumpkins that can contain a variety of items such as a one-hit kill item that kills every enemy on screen, an item that pulls items in towards you, additional coins for use in the shop, and more!

Failing a match doesn't mean you are left in the same state as you were before. Unlocking achievements and finding coins in-game provides you with a currency you can use to further upgrade your witch, giving you more of an edge right out the gate. The unfortunate aspect of this is that the game definitely expects you to be grinding to get to your 'ultimate state,' but there is a level of progression with it that is satisfying. I'd say it definitely expects you to grind too much, but not an unreasonable amount, just a mildly irritating amount.

The audio and sound design is fairly forgettable overall, but not jarring or inappropriate for what is being shown.

Despite having high replay value, there is very little in between that besides unlocking new abilities. It's satisfying to see if you killed 10,000 enemies in one run, sure, but the higher difficulties don't unlock new endings, just higher chances of getting Strong potions that up your transformation meter in a category by 2 instead of 1. 

[h1]--- Issues / Bugs ---[/h1]
¬∑ I had about 3 crashes during my time playing.

[h1]--- Final Thoughts ---[/h1]
Belonging more in the field of being softcore and tame, it's hard to really put Wedding Witch into a category-- being not lewd enough to warrant being a NSFW title and not tame enough to truly be considered SFW. I think I recommend it to anyone who simply likes the cute witch attached to a Vampire Survivor-style game, but not if you're expecting anything more than that.

28985,"Wedding Witch is a rogue lite game that feels like a cute twist on Vampire Survivors. The main draw is an injection of lewd energy, and a slay the spire type of level selection. 

The slay the spire type level selection highlights one of the major sour points of this game however, as levels are too short for you to actually enjoy playing with your build. I find myself often running against the clock, or trying to avoid boss fights so that I can find revealed treasures on the map. 

As difficulty progresses through the games 3 options you'll find that damage seems to be more homogenized between everything, making the balance tip in the favor of abilities that attack at more frequent intervals and at greater range. 

All in all there are some really interesting ideas going on with this game, and the price isn't offensive for what it is, but I'd like to see this game with a little more development and thought put into the game play side of things.

Edit: Lack of mouse support in any way shape or form is also a huge annoyance in this game and feels like a lazy omission.",0
28986,"Before I say anything else, I just want to state what many other reviews have noted- there is no nudity in this game. Suggestive themes and provocative images, yes. but it never goes farther than that.

Wedding Witch is a game I didn't expect to like as much as I did. Being a descendant of Vampire Survivors, it makes sense. But I usually come in to these games with very low expectations- some lewd themes and not much else- so having just a little bit of substance made it a bit more interesting.

The basic gameplay is pretty bland, all things said. If you've played an hour of Vampire Survivors, this is just that but with small ""stage objectives"" to move on to the next round. A round based system is interesting, but there is basically no variety. Your options are either:
A. Kill a set number of monsters
B. Kill one specific boss monster (With nets additional rewards, making it the best hands-down)
C. Wait out a timer
D. ""Break a seal"" which is just waiting out a timer but an invincible enemy drops aoes on you the whole time.
A novelty at first, these game modes end up being not very interesting. As opposed to the 20-30 minute timers of most VS clones, you can finish a whole set of 7 stages in about 30 minutes, which I think breaks up the action a little too much.

Last bit about the actual gameplay, the skills are ""okay"" but ultimately not very interesting either. They all seem to work well enough, but they are often not explained properly (Some don't even have descriptions at all) and the level-up tooltips do not reflect the total gains you're getting across all levels in that skill. The method of acquiring skills through the potions is a good idea, but I do think we need the ability to re-roll level ups as a way to maintain a good build.

The potions system is probably the most interesting part of the whole game. The idea of ""building your waifu"" through body mod potions at the end of each level is pretty cool, and the fact that some potions have direct effects on the character even before the final transformation is pretty neat. It can be frustrating when the potions you want don't spawn, and the fact that your ideal waifu won't always be the most powerful (Small chest my beloved, you're at least half decent), but I really like the concept. I would love to see it fleshed out over a longer period of time, and maybe more options in the potion types.

The art is all decent, it's nice to not be worried about stolen assets. The enemies are kind of uninspired and the lack of zone variety is a disappointing, but it all still works I suppose. 
My biggest criticism in the art department is the initial state of the main character. She's a bombshell right out the gate. While I know that's probably a way to sell more copies, I do think it kind of defeats the purpose of the narrative. She has huge breasts already, why would she want to go out and drink potions to make them even bigger (And the small chest potions don't even really make them small...)? The more niche ones fit okay I suppose, but I think it would be more interesting to have a much more plain main character that you transform into a bombshell with said potions, rather than being hot right out the gate. 

There is also the issue of the translation, it's not very good. The English is often broken and horrifically clunky. It needs another pass over an actual English speaking editor. Not that the story is anything interesting, but even the menus and tooltips are difficult to understand at times. 

Lastly, the music- dull. Sounds royalty free to me. I'm sorry if it's an original track or something, but it does not add anything. Sound effects are not great either, monsters are standard and the main character makes funny sex noises.

All in all, Wedding Witch is alright. Definitely something I would love to see the team expand on and learn from. I think I would love a refined version of this with a bigger budget. Maybe some day.",1
28987,"Definitely not a Hentai game btw, not even really NSFW or Mature imo. But it's one of the best Bullet Heaven games I've played thus far, and I've played a lot.

+/- I didn't win my first attempts, but once you've unlocked most things in shop, the game will not be challenging anymore
+/- Some English translation choices look a bit weird, but nothing too bad

- Transformations feel a little bit too RNG at times. Often, in order to get the right transformations, I have to restart the run over and over until the right potions appear on the map.
- Unfortunately, you can't combine maxed out transformations. E.g. There's no new transformation if you max out Big Breasts and Hips. You max out one or the other, and that's your final form. (If Devs are considering more content for this game, I would kindly request more transformations.)",1

Also in terms of vampire survivor like games, it's not the best, but it's not bad either. It's a bit difficult to tell where the player hitbox is and there are some grammar and perhaps a texture issue or two. There was also one moment in which one of those flower fountain thingies that the owl detects end up spawning when a mana boss had 20% left to fill which pretty much destroyed that run.

Unless the game is planned to get a nudity patch or free dlc any time soon, I would highly recommend correcting this store page.

28997,"Fun, but needs a little more polish.

It would be nice if the ""upgrades"" were reflected a more obviously in the character.  There is no significantly visual update for the Hips power until it is maxed out, the Strength power is similar, but a little better.  It's also disappointing that there is no true mixing of the various powers.  If you max out a power, there is no visual evidence of any of the other leveled powers.

The final images for each end a little rough - more obvious on a big screen.

Very rough progression.  There no real store here, there are no secrets to uncover.  You gather coins to level up base stats.  Complete achievements to get coin bonuses.  But that's it.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]
[*] Fun gameplay
[*] Good fanservice
[*] Decent story


[h2] Cons: [/h2]
The English is a little bit broken however it's usually not a problem when it comes to understanding. Best example would be like how a child speaks.

[*] The harder modes are a too easy. I have completed all of them (3 difficulties in total)

[*] Not a large amount of gameplay. I'm not finished however due to the difficulties being too easy you loose a bit of 
 encouragement to continue playing since you don't feel the need to get stronger as much.

[*] Minor screen issues at the borders of my screen, where the game loads terrain. Not sure if it is due to me having an ultrawide monitor (3440x1440 res). It was not anything major and I didn't really pay much attention to it after playing for a little bit.

Overall it's a great game for its price. If it recieves support/updates I would definitely recommend it, otherwise it is still a decent game for its price (which at the time is [strike] 4,99‚Ç¨ [/strike]   3,99‚Ç¨.)

29003,"At its core, the game has good ideas. This much, it deserves. It's a cute little experience and I like that. And, for the record, the the rating is not a result of the game being bad, it certainly works and is functional...it's just that it also feels incomplete. Since the context within which Wedding Witch exists really help illustrate just how lacking the game is. And, in turn, help illustrate just how much work went into games that Wedding Witch walks in the footsteps of. Because, here's the thing. For the same price as Wedding Witch, you can get far superior experiences in Vampire Survivors, Boneraiser Minions, or even Elemental Survivors with infinitely more depth, polish, and charm. Or, if it's a lewd Survivors-like you fancy, there are games out there that deliver a better playing experience with better sexual content out there as well. 

The most obvious problem that Wedding Witch has is a general lack of polish that almost feel like they get taken for granted in other games in the genre. And, this manifests in many ways. 
Sure, every Survivors-like will have variability in effectiveness of its various weapons and skills, the good ones generally don't have upgrades that you make sure to avoid. There's also a general visibility problem. Be it literally seeing what's happening on the screen with certain attack types. A lack of information with a lack of tooltips. There are also basics that could have been slightly altered to make the game feel significantly better, so you don't have to unlock upgrades to reach what feels like should have been the base starting values. And, of course, there's the game's stability as a whole. The game crashed on me multiple times in my fairly limited playtime. 

A lot of the game also just feels unfinished. For instance, after you complete a run with a maxed out type, you unlock that version of the witch to start the run with. But, as far as I can tell, this is purely a cosmetic choice as the witch reverts to the stock version right away. It's also a shame that the routes have no other interactions other than whichever one you get six hearts in first. It would have been really nice to have the potions transform the witch based on how many of each potion you drank, which in turn could have affected the story in some way. Or, better yet, create infinitely more replayability and fun by having the powers in use be augmented by the potions (e.g. This explosion power now spawns projectiles after detonation). Even what's arguably the best part of the game, the flowers upgrades, feel like they are a good baseline, but could have been so much more extreme in what they can bring to the table. There's also an Extras menu entry that feels like might have been a gallery before the game was scaled down to just two cutscenes and seven stock pieces of art. 

Don't get me wrong, what's there is a really good start...but, it's a start that feels more fitting of an initial release in Early Access, not as a finished product. As, just looking at the game, you can see where the gaps are where if you filled in the missing pieces, the game could have been so much more. Even if that more came with a higher price tag, it would have made the experience feel way more worthwhile.",0

29007,"Here is my review of Wedding Witch after completing 100% achievements.

Graphics:
The graphics are charming but lack consistency. Some areas and characters are well-designed and vibrant, while others feel rushed and lack the same level of detail. This inconsistency can be jarring and detracts from the overall visual experience.

Monster Variety:
The game's monster variety is disappointingly stagnant. After a few hours, it becomes clear that the same types of enemies repeat with little variation, making the combat encounters feel monotonous and uninspired.

Content and Completion:
Despite being marketed as a complete game, ""Wedding Witch"" feels more like an early access demo. The game is notably short, and it feels like significant portions of content are missing. The world lacks depth, and there are few areas to explore, which makes the game feel unfinished and leaves players wanting more.

Adult Content:
Contrary to its marketing, there is no actual adult content in the game. While some might see this as a neutral point, it‚Äôs worth mentioning to set correct expectations for those who might be influenced by the game's promotional materials.

Gameplay and Build Mechanics:
The gameplay concept is interesting, particularly the idea of various build types. However, the execution falls short. Mixing builds often results in a significantly underpowered character compared to sticking with a pure build. This imbalance can be frustrating and limits the player's strategic options.

Game Length:
The game length is excessively short, making it feel more like a brief distraction than a full-fledged game. Even with its low price point, the content offered feels insufficient, and players are likely to be left unsatisfied.

Overall Value:
While it's hard to be overly critical given the low price, ""Wedding Witch"" comes across as an attempt to mimic the success of games like ""Vampire Survivors,"" but it fails to capture the same level of engagement and depth. It feels like the developers lost interest before fully fleshing out the game. Despite its potential, the game falls flat and struggles to justify even its modest price tag.

Conclusion:
""Wedding Witch"" offers a few hours of diversion, but its lack of content, variety, and polish makes it difficult to recommend, even at the low cost of five dollars. It has the potential to be a fun game, but as it stands, it feels incomplete and underwhelming.",0
29008,"Yet another lewd bullet heaven, but aside from some slightly suggestive character art and a questionable upgrade mechanic involving increasing breast, hip size and such... it's very solid actually. A satisfying core gameplay loop in a stage-based progression with bosses and special events, a lot fun weapons ranging from area, melee, even funky animal familiars, and a power creep that hits quite quickly. If there's one thing I can criticize of the gameplay itself, is perhaps the relatively slow speed of player and enemies alike, which never truly becomes high even towards the end of the run.

As of now, the game's content variety isn't too high, as there's no real stage variety aside from the different objectives and bosses. There's 6 classes to unlock, but that's about it. Still, a promising start for a game that is already quite a lot of fun, and frankly not even that lewd.

29014,"[h1] Wedding Witch is a fun game if you give it the chance. [/h1]

First and foremost let's get this out of the way. There is no nudity or h-scenes in this game, do not go into this game expecting that. If you are looking for nudity or h-scenes in a Vampire Survivors style game, I recommend Kagura Survivors and get the free patch for that game. With that out of the way, let's talk about what Wedding Witch does do.

Wedding Witch is a Vampire Survivor like game but instead of going to a stage and trying to survive for the time limit, you instead pick a stage to go to on the map with the goal of progressing to the end to beat the succubus in the final stage. You have three difficulties of maps to choose from being Normal, Hard and Nightmare. Each stage can have a different objective on how to complete it such as defeat a certain amount of enemies, defeat a boss, etc. As you level up you can choose to pick a skill or magic from the four options presented to you in order to power Belle up. These upgrades carry over to the next stage you go to so you are always starting a new stage stronger than you were at the start of the previous stage.

It is important to note that there is no rerolling or banishing here, you get four options and you have to pick one. This could be seen as a let down for some but I think it adds to the challenge of the game. It makes you pay more attention to what skills or magic you choose instead of just blindly choosing and hoping everything works out. This leads into what I think is an interesting mechanic.

As you beat stages you get the choice to take one potion out of a selection of three. This is where an interesting mechanic and fanservice mix. The potion you take will indeed change Belle's appearance but it also is what determines which types of magic she will have better access to. For example if you want projectile magic, you would want to take the potion which makes the breasts smaller. If you want explosion magic you would choose the potion that makes the breasts bigger and so on you get the idea. 

This is interesting as it poses the question to the player, are you more interested in changing Belle's appearance purely for fanservice or do you choose a potion because the magic and skills it gives you access to better compliments your playstyle or works better for your build? Yes there is fanservice here which could cater to a player's interests but at the same time it does work as an interesting mechanic. The way you choose to shape Belle's appearance will also impact what kind of skills and magic you can use. While you could win by making Belle's hips to the maximum level for example, it does not mean you will have the best, or most fun build gameplay wise. The choices you make for fanservice could actually make the game more challenging. 

That is the thing with this game though, if you look past the fanservice of the game, you have an enjoyable game that can provide the player with some challenge and also make the choices you make to strengthen Belle actually fell like they matter. You could choose just willy nilly fire and forget style, and you will most likely feel it in the later stages, especially on Nightmare difficulty. 

The game also has flowers you can find in the stages to add to your bouquet which is your main weapon of attack. When you find the flower you get the option to pick one of three flowers to add to your bouquet which will each have a different effect. Some of these will work great with your build while others not so much. Just like the skills and magic, you do not have a reroll option. What is offered is what you get, make the best choice for what you are working with or plan to work with.

This game is a lot of fun and honestly I think it is worth playing especially if you like Vampire Survivor style games, even if you are not a fan of anime like witches or fanservice. There is actual fun gameplay to be had here if you give it a chance.",1
29015,"As of now, I can't recommend this game.  It's not a bad game, but it's also not great.  There are tons of Survivors clones out there, and this just doesn't stand out.  

1. To get this aside, no matter what the tags say, there is no true sexual content in this game.  Some mild cheesecake, but that's it.  It's cute, but it's not going to be a reason to buy the game.
2. The mechanics aren't bad, but they don't bring enough new to the table.  
3. Enemies are pretty generic.  Even Beautiful Mystic Survivors has better boss fights.
4. Crash bugs with no resuming a run.  If it was one or the other, I could live with it, but it's both.  You crash, you lose the whole run, and it doesn't look like much expectation of updates (note, bought this near release. If you see patch updates when you read this, ignore this complaint)
5. Clearly and sloppily cut content.  There is an Extras button.  It doesn't do anything.  Doesn't even let you replay the simple closing animations.",0
29016,"I'm not gonna claim it's better than Vampire Survivors, but trust me, it's a blast! Perfect for when you're in the middle of something and need a quick break or distraction. Plus, it's totally safe for work‚Äîway safer than some of the people you see on the street!

29017,"It's a good short game, especially if you are a fun of the artist. Unfortunately some part of achievements is too boring for completion and a lot of skills are useless/unbalanced.",1
29018,"Honestly, besides the suggestive content of it. It's a pretty fun game. Vampire survivors style games are always fun and the replayability is there. Gameplay wise, it runs pretty smoothly,( even if I'm using keyboard and not a controller)  haven't encountered any bugs as well.

As for the art side of things if that's important to people,the actual 3d graphics are actually not that bad. 
Also, it's Chowbie, so you can't really go wrong with the illustrations. The ui is nice as well, easy to navigate as well. No complaints so far. Pretty good time killer as well since it's a rouguelike.",1
29019,"Simple, beautiful and addicting.

If you like ""Vampire survivor like"" games, and ""anime waifus"", this is the game for you. 
Finished everything in 15 hours, wish there was more to play. Regardless, loved every minute spent.",1
29020,"Okay, this is a very good bullet heaven game, like, really good.

Everything really works well, the reviews saying only the bouquet deals damage and the spells are useless? Don't listen to them, this people got totally filtered. In fact I have completed several runs with different magic schools and 0 upgrades on the bouquet which is your basic attack, it can be upgraded to deal more damage, have more range and attack faster, but it is only broken when playing on lower difficulties which are unlocked once you clear the previous one.

I have played the game at the same time as one of my friends who also is a Vampire Survivors completionist and we unlocked Nightmare Difficulty (max difficulty at the moment) in just three or four runs. And Nightmare difficulty is what allows you to do even more flashy and broken builds (the bouquet here only works in the first two stages, fully maxed, beyond those two initial stages the bouquet is... just not good enough).

The balancing of the different schools is pretty decent with only one exception being the Familiars (summons) which suffer from attack delays due to them having to look for a new target after killing the previous one, it is not terrible but it would be nice to have more responsive summons.

For the price I loved what I got and I'm a bit frustrated at the same time because the game could be so much better if dual school effects or interactions were added, more illustrations for the endings if you maxed two different magic schools, and more control and customization options for the runs (like more stages, rerolls, banish spells, more control on what type of build you want to do like in Vampire Survivors for example).

I know the game is pretty much an artist's love project (love your art Chowbie), so I believe the game is complete and done, but I REALLY want to see some more updates because the game has tremendous potential. If the devs decide to make good paid DLCs with new stuff I'm 100% willing to pay for them.

Oh right, I also have experienced 0 bugs and the game is NOT NSFW, it is just tasteful spicy art.",1
29021,"Actually pretty fun VS clone with enough differences to set it apart. You go through short (1-3 min) levels in a roguelite fashion, which I found much more palatable than the usual 30 minute ones, especially since while WW is still quite easy, it requires active engagement rather than going afk for 20 minutes since your maxed out character doesn't require any input any more. The artwork is also very nicely done and the many variations provide a good incentive to finish the achievements.
Note to developer: It would be great if there was an option to view the unlocked art from the menu. (Yes there's the artbook, but come on. Based on the comments I also believe it doesn't have the various combined transformations?)",1
29022,"Actually a fun game. No over the top hide your screen hentai just a thicc anime chick hunting demons. Gameplay is pretty solid, and the only problem is even with my PC that can run GTA V, Ark Survival, and any other resource heavy game I can't think of right now at max settings... after about 2 hours in you get lag. And I don't mean just restart the game to clear the cache lag. It's persistent. That being said it was still fun enough for me to 100% it so if you're debating just get it",1

29025,"Pretty good game for the price it costed. lots of things to build had a lot of fun playing it. spend like 3/4 hours in my map.

Improvements:
there are no difficulty nor challenges/objectives. it's just sandbox (i don't mind it) unfortunatly i don't know how to increase the challege other than increase the food consuption to force player to spend more space in food. I limited all my food to 500 and still have 500 of almost everything so villagers do not eat very much. maybe winter season and a coal firewood to warm vilagers something like that.

The shirt production line is a pain. I have like half of my map in cotton production with windmill and still couldn't fullfill the shirt need of my village cause i never had enough cotton.

There was no gemstone in my map so couldn't advance the gemstone line of production.

29033,"So, this is a nice solitaire game but it's not a game with progression, it's like windows solitaire - you win or you don't win and then you play again. But there is an achievement for playing 10 games.

The game is much more strategy than luck but you can sometimes be unlucky since you need a matching suit to be drawn to dismiss a royal.

100% Achievements completed in 90 minutes, I feel like I'd figured most of the strategies in that time. Easy Achievements IMO.

Some value-add would be to have daily / weekly / monthly high score tables - The highest score for one match that is.

29034,"Short, sweet fun to scratch that solitaire itch.  Doesn't reinvent the wheel, but does it just different enough to have a good time.  My only suggestion is once you reach the highest difficulty, it should unlock a table of all the cards you've been through.  Otherwise, have a notepad handy.",1
29035,"[h1] A Card Game KING review [/h1]

Royal Card Clash is a VERY simple game with charming graphics and one amazing soundtrack. Each turn you draw 3 cards where each card deals it's value in damage to enemy cards with the goal of destroying all royals (Hey!). The trick is that royals can only be killed by the card of the same suit. That's it! There are no active or passive powers, not different stages, no story, no bossess, just 3 difficulty levels.

And that's perfectly fine, it's still a very well designed and fun. Not every game needs a ton of extra stuff...but it wouldn't hurt. The issue is that, while the game is fun, you would have seen it all in the first 5 minutes, and by the end of the first hour, there is not much else left to do. 

The strategies are simple, the variety-non existing, but a coffee-break game, perhaps, doesn't need it. It's exactly that, a game that is meant to be played every now and then to kill some time. If that's what you are looking for then it fits the bill perfectly. If, however, you are looking for something you can spend hours on at a time, then this isn't the game that can provide it.

[h1][b]The positive[/b] [/h1] 
+ Lovely graphics and animations

+ Excellent soundtrack

+ Solid gameplay (even if it lacks longevity).


[h1][b]The neutral[/b][/h1] 
* Lacks some quality of life features - like a reset button and overview of cards killed and left in the deck. Not knowing the latter will often lead to games where you have already lost, but don't know it yet and reduces the number of tactical choices one can make.


[h1][b]The negative[/b][/h1] 
- At the highest difficulty RNG is a much greater factor than skill.

[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b] [/h1] 
Coffee-break style game with simple but solid gameplay, great soundtrack and visuals but lacks depth and variety needed to support longer play sessions. Recommended.

29036,"Echoing what GDJ has said. I enjoy what's here, it's really just missing a few small things to make it great. 

I would love some kind of customization either for the card backs, background or ideally both. A reset button would be nice as well, and maybe some steam deck/basic controller support. 

Otherwise, for $4 I can't really complain. The art is nice, and It's a simple and decently addictive little game that i'll probably go back to from time to time.",1

29038,"[i] My Experience [/i]

I had a good time with [b]Royal Card Clash[/b]. It reminded me of another lightweight solitaire-style card game I played last year, [b]Deck 'Em![/b]. I played [b]Royal Card Clash[/b] until I'd  beaten the game on every difficulty at least once, and then continued until I'd accumulated 10 wins (which nets you all of the game's achievements).

It's fairly simple, and has you attempting to attack and defeat all of the royals (face cards) in a deck by attacking them with the numbered cards and aces. Royals are arranged in three stacks with four cards in each. You're dealt three cards at a time, and can put one in a holding slot if you want to save it for later. A 2 card would do 2 points of damage to a royal (and so on), with the caveat that a royal can only be finished by attacking them with a card of the same suit. Aces can either knock a royal down to 1 HP, or finish a royal that has already been reduced to 1 HP. Something that it took me a while to realize (and hopefully this was intentional on the part of developer Gearhead Games) is that if you use an ace to finish a royal that is at 1 HP, the ace goes back into your hand. This is the only time you're able to use a card twice, and this played a substantial role in helping me conquer the highest difficulty.

If you can appreciate a quick-playing, easy-to-learn solitaire game, I think [b]Royal Card Clash[/b] could be just the thing. It's cheap, and I don't regret any of the time I spent with it.",1
29039,"Royal Card Clash is a delightfully innovative take on classic Solitaire, combining strategic elements with the familiar gameplay that we all know and love. As you embark on a journey to defeat royal cards, you'll find yourself captivated by the game's unique mechanics and challenging gameplay.

There are three modes of difficulty: Easy, Standard, and Extreme. The core gameplay is simple: you must use your deck of number cards to attack and defeat the royal cards before your deck runs out. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages thoughtful decision-making. As you progress, you'll unlock achievements and compete on leaderboards, adding a layer of excitement and competition to the game. 

One of Royal Card Clash's strongest features is its easy-to-learn but hard-to-master nature. You'll quickly pick up the basics, but mastering the strategies required to defeat the royals provides a satisfying and rewarding experience. With its intuitive design, the game caters to both casual players and those seeking a challenge.

The game's visuals are clean and appealing, with a minimalist design that allows you to focus on the gameplay. The cards are easy to distinguish, and the game's interface is user-friendly, making it a joy to play on both mobile devices and PC. 

In conclusion, Royal Card Clash is a breath of fresh air in the world of card games. Its unique blend of strategy and classic Solitaire gameplay offers an entertaining experience that will keep you coming back for more. Whether you're a fan of Solitaire or simply on the lookout for something entirely new, Royal Card Clash is an excellent choice.

I'm a fan of Bryn Oh's work and her stories are so rich and thought-provoking that it's a wonderful experience to see The Brittle Epoch brought to life in this format. Whether enjoying the narrative, pondering The Singularity, or just standing and watching the snow fall- this is a gorgeous and important work accessible on many levels.",1
29041,"Bryn Oh's latest title is a remarkable achievement in art and storytelling, an immersive experience that remains faithful to the original story and long-term art project.

Visually, it‚Äôs a treat, meticulously crafted and captivating. Bryn Oh's style and artistic talents shine through in every detail.

The story telling is where this title truly excels. It takes players on a poignant journey. The emotional depth and intensity of the narrative are genuinely heart-wrenching and have a lasting impact.
To me, what sets this version of The Brittle Epoch apart is its ability to provide deeper insights and explanations. Both new and seasoned Bryn Oh admirers will find the storytelling more accessible and engrossing, allowing players to connect with the characters and their struggles on a profound level.

Looking forward to more from Bryn Oh.",1
29042,"The Brittle Epoch

Positives:
+ Artistic
+ The outside looks mostly nice
+ Atmospheric
+ Ok sounds and music
+ The voiceover is okay
+ Its free

Negatives:
- You're encouraged to watch 3 long uninteresting and weird videos on youtube before you begin to play (and its bugged and choppy as well)
- The storys (all beginning with flutter and juniper...) are not interesting at all, and lasts a long time
- Some parts just look bad (dated graphics, low resolution textures, wrong size ratio etc)
- Invisible walls
- You can just walk thru alot of buildings and object
- Bugs
- If you want to hear the stories, you must stand mostly still, or else the story stops and you have to start all over again
- No subtitles
- Not a lot to see or do
- Not well optimized (you need a really good pc to run this smoothly)
- Very short length (even with the long stories)

Maybe I just didnt get this sequel, but I liked Lobby Cam more, and that wasn't a masterpiece either. 
It feels like this game is overtold, and the videos you can just skip. 
They didnt add anything significant to the narrative. 
I was mostly bored by the stories. It would have been much better if there were no stories at all.
Instead maybe there should have been some letters you can find and read. Leave you wondering what its really all about.
Mysteries are way better than being overtold to death.
Or as they say: some things are better left unsaid. Less is more.

Total Score: 3.5/10",0
29043,"This game diverges from traditional gaming as it make you witness the exploration of Flutter and Juniper, two girls navigating an abandoned snow-covered world. There is no quests or actions to do but more a journey through a narrative artwork and storytelling. I like the graphic style; a mix of creepy, dystopian and melancholic ambience. Technically, the project was made with Unreal Engine which make stunning scenes but be sure to adjusting your graphic settings or your GPU may not appreciate the journey.",1
29044,"The game seems to be non-functional. It turned into a slideshow, regardless of what operations I killed on my PC. It also has a 20 minute introduction video, which I guess is pretty interesting, BUT, routing players through to YouTube in the game is a sure way to problems. Not the least of which is that it makes your reasonably cool machinima video run very poorly. I wish I had more gameplay things to say about this but as I mentioned, I couldn't actually experience any of the game.

I am having so much fun with this game and the challenge is just perfect because when I get all of the clues right, I feel so gratified.  The graphics quality is superb.  The sound and music and the overall design is sharp and clear.  This game runs flawlessly without any bugs.  If you love hidden object games but with a little bit more of a challenge and story, then please buy this game and give this dev (or devs) a rewarding review for making part of your day (or days) pleasurable and relaxing.  I am hoping to see more of this type of game from this developer.  Please hurry and make more as I have an unquenchable thirst for this type of game.",1
29051,"This is a very mixed review, very close to a negative one, but it just made it over the edge.
The concept is fun, a hidden object type game where you search a large picture for clues.
On the down side, you can only find them in order, and I find a lot of them before they are called for, which is irritating. 
Also there is a strange, annoying timer, which is not only irritating, but very stingy. Luckily it doesn't seem to end the investigation, but just give you fewer stars. Why? Usually games with the stars-per-level mechanism have some replay value, but once you have found the clues, replay is kind of silly.
And stars are need for achievements, as well as opening night time missions, so they also become annoyingly mandatory. 
The missions themselves are okay, though you are led my the nose by the police telling you what to look for next. In fact the game is so simplistic you might think it is for children, except for the murder, the mentions of pornography, and what I assume is going to be a perverted Santa Claus.
Still, I expect to keep playing, and it is tough to give a negative review to a game I want to keep playing. 
One very tepid thumb up.
ADDENDUM: Kind of difficult when the things you are looking for are hidden, and only clicking the clue button reveals it. Geez. ",1
29052,"Imagine complaining about a game being too difficult when there are easier difficulty settings and you can unlock all the content by playing on the easier difficulties.

This game is fun and unique. A roguelike tower defense game where you can only place towers within your signal range, and placing towers will increase that range. You cannot be afraid to use towers as disposable shields sometimes just to gain ground, and you must be willing to waste resources placing towers you know will be replaced by better ones. Levels have different rewards and you get better rewards for more challenging levels. Some unique level challenges could be mining resources, or saving energy to build a mission goal. The rewards consists of currency to unlock upgrades for your towers, and artifacts that give you passive buffs for the rest of the game. It looks as though there are over 100 artifacts in the game as of now, and the meta progression to unlock new content is as simple as trying out different artifacts.

When you first start the game, there are 2 difficulties unlocked, and beating the hardest available difficulty unlocks your next difficulty. The difficulties have their own names like officer and captain, so I'm not sure what the ""standard"" difficulty is, but I think it's safe to say the ""standard"" difficulty would be one of the default ones unlocked, in which case the game is not nearly as difficult or intimidating as other reviews make it sound. If you decide to increase the difficulty, yes it gets more difficult, and you will probably lose, and perhaps you even need to get lucky with what artifacts you find in order to win. That's kinda normal for a lot of games and idk why people are upset about it. I would be upset if you had to beat the hardest difficulty to unlock things, but to the best of my knowledge, you don't. In other words, this game is accessible. It's not just a brutal game that punishes you. It's easy for people who want it to be easy, and challenging for those who want a challenge.

Not to mention, this game is relatively cheap, and it's well polished as far as I can tell. No bugs, doesn't feel incomplete, it's intuitive and easy to understand. If you like roguelike. strategy, or tower defense games, give this one a try. I will surely play more when I have time.",1
29053,"I've quite enjoyed the demo back in the day and found the gameplay very appealing. I am happy with how the end game evolved since the demo with new mission effects, new towers, more artifacts, etc.

Some missions might seem harder, but the more you learn about the game mechanics and artifacts, the more it makes sense why they're designed the way they are. This makes your choices thoughtful.

I've played for over 10 hours and discovered around one-third of all the artifacts. I haven't tried many other builds you can choose, so the replayability and variety of runs are very decent.",1
29054,"Fun roguelike tower defense game.
Not too far in, but the mechanics are nice. The artifacts feel meaningful. Plenty of choice in how you want to defend.
 $8.99 (10% off) Price is fair, but not a steal.",1
29055,"For the price asked its a nice little tower defense basebuilding game.
Its relatively simple and i feel like its fun comes from the random upgrades (artifacts) you get after each mission.

Its fun, looks nice, sounds nice.

What i wished for, were some more in depth systems that increased replayability like customization of loadouts, stuff i can take from a previous run to the next one to tackle higher difficulties, some more modes, like endless mode (if there is one, i havent seen it, due to short playtime), maybe even finding persistent artifacts i can use to customize my run with (maybe with downsides too).

Furthermore, i think the upgrading paths are a bit limited in choice. Basically every structure has 2 paths to choose from and thats it.
Abilities like laser or the bomb, dont even get an upgrade path although they should and personally i wished there were more artifacts in total.

All in all, for a low price you get a good game that will entertain you for some hours with enough initial depth to keep you hooked, but it lacks some expanded features that could keep you firing it up (like highscores, endless, customization and run mutators) and ultimatively hold it back from its potential.

The dev should keep investing some time adding a few more systems and features, as the basis is there for it to be expanded in any direction he/she wanted.

I really like it and its my pick of the month as of now. An Arcade Tower Defense Game.",1
29056,"This Game is pretty Fun, and although many people say that it ""isnt balanced enough"" and i can agree to that, This game has only been released for 3 Days. Give the Devs more Time you cant already come out with a masterpiece in your hands.",1
29057,"[h3]A good rouge-like. Easy start to hard scaling. Absolutely worth the current price[/h3] 

Understanding the first synergies and starting META are a bit of a puzzle. RNG only becomes necessary at Legend difficulty.

Half the fun is finding it out yourself!",1
29058,"Kinda boring. Just do the same gunner, wall, generator build every time.  It is fun but not for long. I didn't wanna believe the others, but it is based on what upgrades your able to get. I got the mech early and destroyed. Would be so much fun like war of the ages type stuff but they made it too short and too steep.",0
29059,"This game is too easy, they should add more difficulties to make it harder. I beat the 2nd difficulty 1st try and all the next ones 2nd try. Legend mode is certainly harder, but the game isn't too much of a challange. Good game, would recommend.",1
29060,"It's Dome Keeper but just the fighting part and it's a tower defense. There was clearly a [i]lot[/i] of inspiration taken. 
Lots of fun and surprisingly well balanced. It does get fairly repetitive but the different factions/towers help with that. Very solid game overall. All of the different builds and tower types all feel pretty satisfying to use, which is pretty hard to accomplish without anything feeling clearly favored. Except for the items/artifacts, some of those are really good and some are really bad and the rarity doesn't seem to have anything to do with it.
The curve of the five difficulties the game has feels just right to where the first two difficulties are basically baby mode and the last two difficulties are a real challenge. The difficulty curve across a single game (at any difficulty) is also good, and feels the right amount of challenging throughout.",1
29061,"Fun game. Not as difficult as some people are complaining. I try ""maining"" a new tower every run for variety and have won with them all. Some towers are definitely worse than others (focus laser) and some much better (war robot, infinite upgrade resource cube). I haven't lost yet on the 2nd difficulty.

The game needs more content but what's there right now is fun. Just keep adding more and it'll be even better. It'd be cool if there wasn't as much tower overlap between the different classes also, or at leas they had different upgrade trees if they're so essential (wall) that all classes need them.",1
29062,"Thanks you developer for listening and making adjustments!
The balancing has improved the feel and pacing of the game. 

Previous review:

""At the moment balance feels very off. 
It might be a simple adjustment of giving more credits at the start of a round, or slowing the enemy spawn.
That said I've gotten far with a run, but only because I had a lucky few artefacts drop early on, that helped me stay on par with the enemies, by supplying me with the resources I needed.""",1
29063,"While it's not perfect, the game is fun. The biggest complaint is balance. I don't like how early the [spoiler] immortal [/spoiler] enemies spawn, it just isn't fun because the strategy turns into stalling(Which is mostly wall spamming and the occasional pusher). But outside of that, the enemies can be somewhat fun to go up against. I do wish we got resources a bit faster, because scaling the upgrade trees can be a bit more difficult than I like. The artifacts do make the game more fun and can change your playstyle! I think a change I'd really like is the ability to completely change what buildings you have access to, like either having a balance to spend to decide which ones to use, or just filling out X amount of slots with which ever buildings you'd like. Maybe even a random button! I definitely think the game has good potential, and even with everything I've said I am still enjoying it. I can't wait to see the future of this game!",1
29064,"Eh.   It's OK.
I beat it on all the difficulties.   And then did the achievement for winning with no upgrades.   It is not as hard as other reviewers have said.  

Good:
-The game looks cool
-There are some good strategies involved
-Lots of artifacts

Bad:
-Not many things to unlock by doing runs.  There is not much meta progression.
-Mostly you do the same build order, which gets boring.
-TAB button pauses the game, and SPACE is changing speed..... whyyyy   almost every game uses SPACE key for pause.   And there is no way to remap the keys.
-Many of the artifacts are not good.
-Couple artifacts are overpowered (and they are not the Legendary ones).   There are common artifacts that are better than the legendary ones.
The animation speed on the menus is maddeningly slow.",1
29065,"I love the concept and the minimal art style but... it's not fun. You never feel like you are getting more powerful. You are forced to follow the meta every step of the way, at the start of every mission. I think it could be improved by more generous income and more enemies at the same time. Or, allow players to upgrade the amount of starting resources/station income without relying on that ONE artifact. That would allow some more experimentation with builds and playstyles without trivializing the difficulty.

I will give this another shot after some time, but right now it's a nope from me.",0
29066,"After a few goes with this game i can say that its really just not very fun with how its tuned right now. They have somehow managed to frontload all difficulty into the very beginning of a run, either you take off with good modifiers or you don't. But the worst part is it doesn't really feel like i can make much of a choice during the game. There is only one right way to place or upgrade building depending on your luck with artifacts, which really takes the entire point of playing the damn game away. If i have to start every and end every mission doing the EXACT same placement/ replacement of buildings and only mix things up because i got a decent artifact every once in a while thats not very fun, it might as well be autopilot.

Its a real shame, because the art direction and feel of the game are great, but it just feels so constricted of player agency that its suffocating.",0
29067,"Pretty simple at the start, and there are a lot of different artifacts all with a different effect and rarity, just a great game for relaxing but you can also use powerful strategies with specific artifacts required for it, overall a great game for just about any time and you can pick the easiest mode if you're just trying to relax after a long day, or try to make complex strategies to have the biggest experience.",1
29068,"Pleased that my suspicions about this game bore out - one fun tower defense game, of a sort.

The closest analog might be DomeKeeper, at least in regard to the combat and smooth visual style. All enemies approach from the right, you place defenses relative to your base facility.

You collect Artifacts to enable meaningful abilities or traits, all of which are then active. Each of your defenses has an upgrade tree, featuring similarly meaningful choices. This combines in to a Hell of a fun game. Worthy!",1
29069,"Fun little tower defence. Quite a lot of variety and the difficulty seems reasonable after being patched.

The first 30 seconds of each mission is a bit slow since it's generally 1 turret vs 1 small enemy. Maybe your first deployment could be instant to solve this.",1

I played my first game and i am in awe of the IMMENSE content of this game!

Try it but be prepared for all this awesome game has to offer!!
I am looking forward to playing it for hours to come!!!",1
29072,"Very fun and engaging strategy game with much careful thought in its design. Extremely underrated compared to others in its genre. Highly recommend to planning/strategy fans who enjoy facing tough enemies and optimizing heavily to beat them, and those who enjoy being continually challenged/engaged.

There is an excellent balance of structures and instant abilities, where using both is indispensable to beating higher difficulties. Moreover, all the structures and abilities serve a purpose, not only as a whole but within a run - you almost never reach a point where a button gets obsoleted and the best strategy becomes just spamming a few specific buttons every fight until the run ends. 

The enemies and challenges are varied enough to not just repeat the same build order each fight, and similarly the relics are varied enough to enable different strategies each run. Moreover, taking individual hard fights will cost you health but is rewarded with relatively minor rewards (that still add to a significant amount over a course of a run), which significantly mitigates the ""taking elites is always the right play unless you are literally about to die"" non-choice overly prevalent in similar games.

TLDR: the greatest strength of this game is that it keeps you thinking and itself engaging, unlike much of the dross in its genre.

[hr][/hr] 

One nitpick: the second half of the run is less interesting than the first half. If a run can beat the midboss, the run's strength is too often enough that ""hard"" fights are beatable with nearly no risk until the end boss, and currently for the second half of the run the focus is on the best reward with little risk-reward analysis. In my opinion, after the midboss on higher difficulties, the hard fights should scale way faster and be way harder, while providing at least a couple easy options so you still have a choice if you decide you can't handle the hard fights; basically it shouldn't be a complete no-brainer to pick hard fights. (Addressing this would also mitigate the matter generator's OP-ness...)

29073,"I love to play roguelike and roguelite style games and this game is quite good at what it provides. The early difficulties help to ease the player in and teach about all the mechanics of the game. Whereas the latter difficulties provide a real challenge to beat.

The game is not without flaws though, as the starting faction is in my opinion by far the weakest. The turrets don't do enough, they struggle to get a good economy going and there buildings are quite lack luster compared with the other 2 factions. I do hope the developer gives the first faction some love with the base turrets so they can have an easier time setting up a defense like the other factions. E.g. increasing the turrets attack range so multiple turrets can attack past a wall.",1

Would Like more Variety. 
Acceptable enough for the price. Satisfying.
Difficulties get intense. Too much so for me, but that's perfectly fine.

29075,nice tower defense game. Hard starting off but it's fine when you have a system set up. Getting legendary artifacts is fun but repetitive after a long while. Same gameplay but more/harder enemies. Still worth the price.,1
29076,"Yes there is a difficulty curve at difficulty 3 but it feels to rewarding to beat it, especially when it wasn't just rng. There are hand few of generally broken artifacts but the good ones require you to actually build around them. Forcing a build in this game isn't recommended later on and incentives heavily to go with what you're given with. 

Don't over look some relics, for example: getting 10 defense (temporary health) at the start of each mission seems kinda like it's helping noob players but it actually allows you to ignore the 1st wave and build generators immediately.

If you want dumb/easy fun stick to the 2nd or especially 1st difficulty. If you want to learn from mistakes until you form a strategy then try to get to legend and beat it like im trying. Best of both worlds 8/10.

Edit: Beat Legend but I had a busted run. I had lasers give rad, free lasers every so often, + Rad damage, etc. 
Legend is one of those hard for the sake of being hard difficulties, like A20 in StS, not designed (for 95-99% of players) to win-streak or to play consistently but rather for the challenge and to prove that even if you have a broken run (in any rogue-like) that there's a difficulty that can punch down on you.",1
29077,"One of the best tower defense games in awhile for players looking for a tough challenge. Very well balanced overall where every decision matters and almost every option has a purpose. The game also is such where it feels very fair and you never feel cheated into death.

The first two difficulties are very easy where pretty much anything will work. The game actually starts once once you get to the 3rd difficulty and up.",1
29078,"What I like about the game is the variety of units and how they can change with upgrades, and the advantages of combined arms. For instance, the mortars initially left me cold. Then I realized that with an upgrade I could turn then into bombers. Walls are fairly useless until they are backed up with the device that pushes enemies back. Rockets are great for defending the base. The bosses at the end levels are the only time I use the lasers and the bombers and then I buy mass quantities. I am still feeling my way, so I assume at the higher levels I would probably see things that I am missing right now, or aren‚Äôt important because the challenge is less. I like the fact that there is a choice of the next mission until the end of the level. I have always been a sucker for games that I can play quickly over my lunch hour and this fits that category nicely for me. Generating energy and mining are almost a sub game. I have found the pinned game hints in the discussion thread to be useful as a starting point for developing my own tactics and strategy.",1
29079,"It's a no from me my man. 

The game has a lot of potential, but even on Adventurer, I was getting slapped around after round 3. Enemies are too tanky, too fast, and too strong. 

There also needs to be some RPG aspect that allows you to upgrade things permanently that you can carry into each mission.  

Will probably give it another try in a few weeks or months once there's been some proper balancing, but for now I'd save your money.",0
29080,"Edit #2: Changing my review back to positive, after talking to the dev there's some synergies in the game that make it easier. However, this isn't communicated well and I think it's mostly a UI/Tutorial issue. If FiveHead improves on those, I think a lot of us that felt the game is too difficult, will have some better luck with our runs.

The game could also use a little more in the way of meta progress. There's not much to unlock after a couple of hours. But that's a longer issue to solve.
----

Edit: I gave a quick positive review to support the dev. I've since put 10 hours in, and some post patch and boy is the game extremely difficult, and not in a ""get better"" kind of way. I truly think the higher difficulties are not humanly possible to complete as I've had times where I'm losing on the second level on an easier difficulty and there's nothing I could have done to do better.

The core of the game has a lot of potential, and I hope Fivehead can keep at it and make the game the best it could be. But it's not at that point right now. I don't think it's worth the $10 currently as it's not even playable imo.

Great little tower defense game. Got like 30 hours out of the free demo, I suspect I'll get twice that from the full game. Not bad for $9-10",1
29081,"Please do not listen to the people saying the game is too hard, it was easy to clear missions before the nerf patch, this is a rogue-like tower defense game, in the vein of Dome Keeper (Also a Godot game), it is supposed to be hard, but it is not punishingly so. After you get a few artifacts and unlocks, and learn how the systems work. You'll be clearing harder difficulties in no time (My only criticism is I wish there was a way to see in game what Artifact's you have and haven't already collected.)",1
29082,"We need more thing to beat!!!! The game right now very good with combination of Artifact, but still need some more challenge that dont seem to be repetitive....",1
29083,"This game is simply great. Any complaints about difficulty are unwarranted as once you understand which strategies are effective and which aren't, the game becomes far less of a challenge. The difficulty remains fairly constant as you gain more experience whilst attempting further difficulties. The premise of the game is very entertaining and once you find one of many effective strategies that suit your playstyle this game proves to be satisfying and fun.",1
29084,"very very repetitive, you start with a loadout(about 7 or 8 weapon 3 abilities) which removes a lot of the roguelike aspect of the game, i feel like the game would be way better if you started with one weapon and build your loadout while you play, every game feels the same.",0
29085,"Game is short, repetitive , and hard.  Its only made harder by the fact that if you die, it restarts you from the beginning and theres no healing between missions.  My main complaint is that you cant really enjoy game play because its like you are barely hanging on by the skin of your teeth, then the second you become slightly comfortable, all other paths close and you are forced to end the game with a boss fight. waste of ten bucks tbh",0
29086,"[strike]the balance is so screwed up. havent even unlocked higher difficulties because they throw impossible missions at you regularly enough that getting a run which happens to be lucky enough to push past all the bosses isnt possible in the 5 hours ive played. even the easiest difficulty, whose description makes you think it is for children, is just too difficult. if you lose a single mission, you need to abandon the run because the loss of upgrade materials is enough to fail you, on the EASIEST difficulty. if failing a single mission is meant to be a run killer, then the escape pod mechanic should be removed entirely, instead of wasting the players time soldiering through a dead run.i personally think in all but the harder difficulties the scaling should be forgiving enough to use the escape pod, lose the upgrade materials, and be okay. thats just not how the game is balanced right now.

also the pause button doesnt work, but the game does pause if you tab out. the game reeks of lack of polish like this. sometimes upgrades or artifacts will reference a weapon name that isn't in the game, so you're looking through all of your gear wondering what item it effects, for example. the enemies will sometimes get stuck on regenerating energy walls, where they will damage the building behind the wall despite the wall holding them back. i could go on, but i didn't take notes while i was playing.[/strike]

edit for new update:
still too hard, but the developer seems to be listening to feedback, and the difficulty is now a little more reasonable. my primary issue now is that some of the armored enemies (particularly the one that looks like a partially hatched egg) just have too much health. officer difficulty is still left up to chance, because if you arent given artifacts that allow you to focus an incredible amount of damage on these already armored enemies they will destroy all of your buildings. 

i have a hard time believing any amount of internal playtesting would miss this. but im not in the room and maybe there's some obvious mechanic ive totally missed. so i'll switch the review to recommended. the game isnt that expensive and if they continue making balancing changes it's worth the money. also, the pause button works now, which is nice.",1
29087,"Fun game for about an hour. Probably wont play again if I'm being honest. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, it's just super simple and doesnt have stay power for me personally.",1
29088,"The game is really good, it lacks a bit of depth to improve replayability but the general concept is nice. I really enjoyed playing it.
worth the price",1
29089,"Wouldn't recommend until difficulty balancing changed. As others have said, most of the difficulty is in the first wave of each round. This makes the game extremely binary. If you can quickly get a build online to survive the first wave, the game becomes trivial. If you can't, then at the higher difficulties you will be wiped out almost immediately. This basically turns the game into Speedrun Reset Simulator and if you play at any difficulty higher than officer you will be abandoning games at round 2 over and over and over to get a good run. 

I like difficulty, but if it was shifted from front-loaded to back-loaded, you could see more viable runs and less boredom on the good runs. Dying instantly because you can't deal with a multi Tank first wave is not fun. Watching the clock as you wait to win your run with a good setup is not fun. I appreciate the efforts of the dev and will come back to retry this one after more patches.",0
29090,"Small Update: The dev has made 3 patches since the main part of this review (see below). It seems a lot more balanced and doable but i have yet to find the time to play it a lot more. That being said the hard difficulties are (surprise!) still hard but more fair. 

Main Review:
I dont ever make reviews but I have some concerns that need to be addressed before this can be a game. I love strategy games like this, Im also very good at them.
That being said I beat the first difficulty (out of five total) on my first run, I beat the second difficulty in a few runs and the third difficulty after trying and failing for almost 6 hours. I was only able to beat the third difficulty because of a cheese which has already been removed from the game.
I have tried the fourth difficulty a dozen times and have yet to make it past the 3rd level alive. It is physically impossible to beat. The monster scaling is so high that the only slightly viable method is stunning/delaying the enemies in some way. This isnt a matter of me not being good (see that I play these types of games a ton, i intuitively know how to play well) or even bad rng with artifact rolls. You simply dont ever have enough money to build an economy and defend, the waves start too soon and by the time it starts youll barely have a single building turret down which can only stop 1 out of the 3 or 4 initial enemies that rush you. Ive tried other starts with a stall tower but even then you lose at minimum, with perfect play and a good starting artifact, 9 life, meaning with that start and no other life loss, youd lose within 7 levels. 
This game has only been balanced for the first and second difficulties, the third is barely doable with good rng and some cheese and the final two arent even remotely possible. There is no way the later difficulties were play tested before release and if they were then id like to see a detailed video showcasing how to beat them, and a video that is repeatable. 

All in all i recommend waiting until the game is balanced before buying it.
TLDR: Game is unbalanced for later difficulties and isnt actually possible to beat.",0
29091,Great game! Hereby an overview and first impression: https://youtu.be/mPfHo8B_VvU But just buy it. It's very cool. It has waaay more debt than you think it is because you also need to keep in mind how long it takes for the tower to be there. Combined with the range and upgrades. The combinations go very far.,1
29092,"Really like how much your gameplan can change over the course of a run. I don't think any other roguelike I've played has this much swing, where you can look at the artifact options, check your bank and immediately go 'alright, gunner turret spam in the front can defend against all the small enemies now, I'm speccing the laser turrets into single-target damage'. Even within each stage it's pretty interesting. Gunner turret as first drop is almost always going to happen, but for the second drop gunner turret, wave generator, wall, and generator are all solid options depending on what enemies are coming.

Definitely worth the price if you enjoy that sort of strategising. Artwork is good and UI is nicely designed too.",1
29093,"Very fun game with numerous ways to defend. Loving the latest update of the drones, very fun to focus on for boss runs.",1
29094,"Simple game with good core loop.
Steal at less than 5 bucks, but worth the full price.",1
29095,"I bought it because I heard it was hard and had a blast unlocking and beating the hardest difficulty.

A fresh take on classic game mechanics. Extremely interesting mechanics that I kept exploring more and more, even finding out that relics and upgrades that seemed bad were actually good in different situations creating entirely different builds. Early game is indeed very rough and I find myself prioritizing early game upgrades and relics throughout the entire game (early game is hard and an early advantage snowballs a lot). I think it's good the way it is as it kept me at the edge of my seat.",1
29096,"Really fun and challenging Game. If you like tower defense type games, give it a try!!",1
29097,"I am not a huge fan of Stellar Initiative, but it is if you are a fan of tower defense games and roguelikes I think that you could have fun.

Stellar Initiative is a barebones tower defense relying on a singular dimension to act as the path to the base that you are defending. It varies from others in the genre by being a roguelike and offering a flexible (though quite short) campaign path. There are a variety of mission types which is something that I found quite creative for a game like this and adds some much-needed variety for how simple the main gameplay loop is. That loop is Start mission, build generators for power, build towers and walls for your defense, use abilities to help when you need it, finish missions to get upgrades and artifacts then rinse and repeat until you beat the bosses. So how good is this gameplay? It‚Äôs passable. I don‚Äôt think there is a ton to write home about here. The upgrade paths are simple but good, artifacts are unique, replayability exists with trying to get all the artifacts and playing with the different factions, different mission types mix things up, mission modifiers add some extra challenge in the mid-game, and the bosses are acceptable. The shortness of the runs is both a benefit and a curse, I never felt like I was either getting to my full potential or having to stay for too long; but I think if there was more variety in enemies, the strategies you need to fight them, and if upgrades were a bit easier to come by the length could be extended and it would make things better. I felt like there was one central strategy that was best as far as gameplay went in my runs (just amass turrets and generators and only add other things if absolutely necessary), so I never was enticed to do otherwise especially when you only ever get enough resources to upgrade two things to their fullest so that made the game feel a lot less strategy oriented. I also felt that weapons should have been separated from buildings in the creation queue, it just felt awkward and made doing quick defenses an absolute annoyance that cost me health and towers that felt like they were lost undeservedly. Also, mining missions should give you the option to leave once you get the minerals (there are reasons not to force end it, so the option is best), I sat in a mining mission and twiddled my thumbs for far too long on occasion and I hate it when a game wastes my time. Overall, the game is fine to play, but I think pacing is a central issue. As a final note on gameplay, I initially was going to just thrash this game and say how boring it was when I first started this review, but decided to go back and it clicked with me more. I don‚Äôt think that it is a good sign when you have to play for 1 and ¬Ω hours to get a game like this to click and I think that is why a lot of people complain about the difficulty, it isn‚Äôt hard, it just likely hasn‚Äôt clicked for them I think. So, your mileage may vary on this one, but I found myself enjoying it by the end.

No story is available and I think that even a barebones one would have been nice, moving on.

The sound design is not great. Although the weapon and combat sounds are fitting for the visual style given, they are still simplistic and limited in their number. What bothers me the most out of anything else in the game though is that there is only one song. Honestly, I cannot think of a single game that I have played with just one song besides this one. This game could have easily had 5 songs (menu, mission, ship, Boss 1, Boss 2) and I probably still would have griped, but this is a low I have not seen before. The song is not even that good either, it lacks any sort of energy that makes me want to keep playing, and not only is it the only song, but the song itself is repetitive. Is it thematically fitting? Eh, vaguely, but that hardly matters in this case. While writing this portion I actually went back and tried to prove myself wrong. Nope! The closest thing to a second song is literal silence when you are doing stuff on your ship. This just made the game some much harder to enjoy and I cannot say I have ever been so disappointed in a soundtrack for a game before in my life.

I think my favorite part of this game is the art style. Its muted and simplistic color palette combined with the silhouette style pixel art is very appealing to me. All the menus, units, and interfaces match thematically. The colors are used to create clear visual representations of useful information (you‚Äôre black, their red, shields are orange, artifact qualities are colored, that kind of stuff). And the model work fits into the game well. Honestly, I can‚Äôt think of a single complaint. Some may prefer more color in the game, others will want more variety in models, maybe some unit shading for depth or something silly like that, but for me, the game has a particular style that looks good and is consistent plus it is 100% functional, for a game like this it is perfect. Simplicity can be bliss if you know what you are doing.

I am pretty mixed on this one, but in the end, I had fun and think it is worth recommending to those who are fans of tower defenses and roguelikes. Is it worth $10? No. I wouldn‚Äôt spend anything more than $5 on this game as it currently stands and I think that it is probably actually worth $3 to most people. Humble Bundle is where I got this one, and it wasn‚Äôt a bad game to get. It is short, simple, has an abysmal soundtrack, and is moderately fun. Stellar Initiative is a completely average game built for a specific audience and that is okay.",1
29098,"Fun, fresh entry to the rogue-like genre.

The consensus of Stellar Initiative being hard is fair, but I think people aren't considering that there is a learning curve. The first 10 or so runs I was pretty bad. After losing and learning how to win, the difficulty felt reasonable.

I thought runs might get stale with the few number of buildings available, but I was constantly surprised at the unique strategies I would put together to create a strong build. One of my favorites was when I was unlocking the win without upgrading achievement. My strategy was lining up walls with a dense stack of war robots on top, and three rocket launchers behind. With a good economy I was able to replenish walls and war robots as they were destroyed. Assuming you are upgrading, there are a surprising amount of synergies between the buildings depending on the path you take on the upgrades. I do think that strategies to beat the two bosses are much more limited though, and the game would benefit from new bosses with different weaknesses.

Maybe a hot take but the game is not too RNG heavy on the easier difficulties. I have found the game to be pretty generous with decent artifacts early on, and if you can adapt to what is given to you well you should be able to win. On star lord and legend difficulty the first few waves are the hardest, and getting artifacts helping you in the early game ASAP are necessary to win. Those difficulties are RNG heavy for this reason, but its a hard difficulty on a rogue-like game, so I didn't mind resetting most of the time.

Now I have won on every difficulty level and about ready to put this game away. To me it was worth $10 for the 30+ hours of content",1

The game itself is like a more intricate faster-paced battleship, where the organs you choose (which function like the ships in battleship) give you power-ups that impact how you play the game. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a party game to play with friends!

29113,"Not really sure about the negative or positive, but maybe it is just not my type of game. The game is beautiful and very well made, the mechanics are simple, but the 'strategy' and 'base building' elements aren‚Äôt as important as I had hoped.

Throughout my first playthrough, I started to understand that merging buildings from lower levels to higher levels is not really how the game is played best. It is much better to just get a combo to get some cards, which gives you higher level placeable buildings and allow to move buildings around the map freely. So, if you just reserve some space to make a 5-9 combination of level 1 or 2 buildings, the game is pretty easy. I got all achievements in about half an hour, which isn‚Äôt that challenging.

It's free, so it‚Äôs not a bad shout to see whether the game is for you, but I just think that after this playthrough, I‚Äôm not really interested in setting some high score, playing it again or buying the full game.

I hoped the game would offer buildings of different shapes and that combining could be done in several ways with varying results.

Would have at least imagined some effect or bonus score by doing so. Lets say a combo o 3 lvl8 towers would provide extra score to any upgrade done next to them or something.

The game is a good example of a solid and fun idea not developed enough to live up to its potential.

Truly feeling how fragile things are, realising that all beauty in life will disappear unappreciated if one does not cherish it. Realising, there is only one chance in life. Not taking an opportunity, a chance to great joy will make it pass away, and it won't ever come back. building a town for 50000 people gave me enough time to rethink my own existence. How I used to be an asshole here and there. Probably too often. Most likely too often. No. It was already too often. Others do not get more chances at life either. Ruining this very unique experience for someone is the worst a human could do. We truly should appreciate everything he have in this very moment. Who knows for how long we get to enjoy it?

29136,"7.5/10 Classic merging puzzle in meditative city building setting.

TLDR: A classic merging puzzle with pleasant looks and audio. Great if you have a VR set

Good:
- it's a well-known puzzle type where you need to put groups of 3 or more elements of the same tier for them to merge into a single element of the next tier. But there are boosts here like moving and element to an empty spot or swapping with another element is you make more than 1 match in a single turn. 
- music is top-notch, very relaxing
- the pieces on the board look like houses, and there are far more variations of them in the full game. Overall, the graphics are very pleasant here
- stylish UI design
- free (prologue)

So-so:
- it's somewhat unclear from the looks of the elements what tier they are until you've played this for a while. I guess games of this type would be clearer if they just used plain numbers, though certainly it wouldn't look as nice
- well, it's not original, and you can find thousands of games of this type (maybe with minor differences in rules) on mobile, for free. So I guess, at its modest full price of about $5 it's worth it if you value aesthetics

Bad:
- nothing

The aesthetics seem soft and relaxing at first, but it begins to feel dull, lifeless, gray and boxy after a while. I'd like to see trees and citizens wandering about to feel like its a town. Still, it's a nice game to have in the background.

29156,"7:45AM. I rip out of my driveway in dad's old Ford F-150 and hit the corner hard, tearing through a group of three joggers on the sidewalk. They flip through the air like confetti. I flick the wipers on. Doesn't matter. I've got a date at Storage Steve's on Fourth and Hell.

Tripling my kill count along the way, I roar through the chain-link fence surrounding ol' Steve's. A few veterans of the storage-vulture trade recognize the truck as it pulls in. Some flee. I skid to a stop, fishtailing into a grandmother.

""Opening bid's $300,"" the auctioneer calls out to the crowd as I step out of the truck.

""Eight million,"" I shout as I stride into the fray of would-be buyers. The crowd disperses.

The auctioneer smiles and hands me the key to the storage unit. The moment he lets go of the key, he's gone, like an almost-remembered gap in the memory or a ""spot the difference"" game with only one picture. I pay the concept no mind. That's just how auctioneers are.

Crunching my hand into the sheet metal and tearing the door free, I blink in surprise. Guns. Guns! It looks like an armory in here, stocked by somebody with a fear of shelves. Had anybody else outbid me, they could have armed a small militia and finally put an end to my truck's rampage through the sleepy suburb. Tough luck, you clowns: I'd been playing online blackjack for sixteen hours straight.

7:45PM. After unceremoniously backing my flatbed full of AK-47s through the front door of my home, I crack open my laptop and start posting listings on my shop site at the speed of light: 
""COOL NERF GUN FOR CHILD BUY NOW""
""EASY MAGIC WAND **LEARN FIREBALL IMMEDIATELY**""
""AK-48 THE SEQUEL!! NEW KIND OF WEAPON FOR ANY FUTURE SOLDIER""
""TWO GUNS AT THE SAME TIME (CANT DUAL WIELD WITHOUT THIS AUCTION!!)""

[i]Ping! Ping ping ping![/i] Here they come. The customers. My life force.

""I'm $35,000 short for this listing- Would you take a $5,000 bid?"" one asks.
""No. In fact, my new offer is $90,000,"" I reply.

The pattern for negotiation is easy to find to get the most out of your items and after seeing ""Legendary"" items at 80% of garage sales, it's easy to see where to make money. All of that being said, it is rather cathartic to drive around and pick up items for cheap and sell them online after you ""fix"" them. Leveling up is easy and to get to the end game content took less than 4 hours. Is it worth the money? I don't think so at this stage, but in the future it could be really good. 3/10",0
29160,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

5/10: Very amateurish, but the developer seems to be staying on top of bug spraying, and great fun with all things considering. (And to think ol' Il Pallino normally only likes simulation games involving cops, crooks, and big, mean-lookin' American trucks.)

[h1]Overview[/h1]

Think American Pickers, only you don't get a cutie like Danielle to point you in the direction of where to look for old junk, and the items that the player finds can be repaired before sale. Starting with a home, a hammer, an object scanner, and a pick-up truck, the player goes about acquiring objects from abandoned storage units and yard sales through buying low and selling high. More money allows for the player to upgrade their hammer and object scanner so they can make greater improvements to objects below perfect condition and use their scanner to find the value of greater valued items to which they sell on the internet. Earning XP flips the difficulty curve and allows for more effective haggling with buyers and sellers, along with discounts at winning auctions on storage units.

[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]

The graphics are on the lower end of what a player would expect from a simulation game. Not too bad but also not great.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3074007167

The sounds, however, are a bit limited, and several actions have redundant sounds. The auction sounds are humorous, but there was a stranger who complained to ol' Il Pallino at a coffee house about the invalid action sound being ""creepy."" (The sound was certainly annoying.)

[h1]Positives[/h1]

Perhaps the most positive aspect of [i]Storage Hustle[/i] is that item names and descriptions can be changed before listing said objects for sale on the internet, which is good fun, and can make for fun screenshots.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3075450203

If anyone thinks that the idea of buying old crap, fixing it up, and selling it is fun, then you can say that you've found your game. (However amateurish.) And to ol' Il Pallino, [i]Storage Hustle[/i] is pretty fun for what the game primarily entails.

[i]Storage Hustle[/i] has plenty of fun items available, even if the garage sales are mostly the same objects, but the player will start to see plenty of  new-old objects when they unlock higher level storage unit auctions.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]

Bugs, bugs, bugs, and bugs. The bug rating has been downgraded from [i]Roach Motel[/i] to [i]Newberry's Backyard Barbecue's second owner[/i] since the developer has stayed on top of bugs before release. (Note to aspiring curators: Curation is not for the faint of heart, and the depending on the price of the game, the player better claim their free copy knowing that they're going to be the guinea pig.)

If the player is the sort of player that can only enjoy high quality games, then the player should best stick to their AAA games, because this is an indie game, and with it, the player can expect some audio glitches, and driving is somehow even worse than the driving on I-95 in Miami-Dade County, Florida. (At least the cars stay in their appropriate lane, which is more than what Frandiber Santana can say.)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Without knowing the regular price of [i]Storage Hustle[/i], the player would do well to wait for a sale, but because the amateurish nature of [i]Storage Hustle[/i] at full price is liable to drive the player crazier than a laughing hyena on crack rock. At least there are no genuine competitors to [i]Storage Hustle[/i], so the player really has no alternative... At least the developer doesn't seem to be anything like Posh from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198246234164/recommended/750520/]Arcade Tycoon[/url] and is actually doing something about bugs as opposed to whining about how criticisms are unfair.

[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino... OR ELSE![/h1]

29162,"This game gives me nostalgic feelings from when I was a kid, I would often sit in the living room and watch Storage wars on TV, followed by Pawn Stars. This game is Storage wars, it's bidding it's haggling, it's what we all want and expect from a game like this. However it has a few bugs, but the Devs are actively listening and paying attention to everything. 

for their first ever game they've hit the mark, a bit more polish however to make it truly shine, but this is their passion, their project and I truly believe it's a game worth getting behind. Keep up the great work devs!",1
29163,Came to the game to chill and buy storage units then i found blackjack and now im a recovering gambling addict,1
29164,"[b]4 and a half hours. [/b]

That's what it took me to complete the game, get all the upgrades and the tools available, even bought a new car and a house for money sink. (I got a plus 1 h in the game because i left it open when i went to dinner)

Don't get me wrong, this game isn't easy but either hard, it's in the spot where you don't need a lot of brain power to do stuff and at the same time doesn't present any difficulty. It's a weird spot. And after you unlocked everything there is nothing left to do.

I encounter only a handfull of bugs, like 3, where the control didn't respond very properly and once my iten that i just bought disapeared.

The graphics are not very pretty, but they are ok. 
There is funny stuff in there, like when [spoiler] i got an ak-47 and the description said ""With this you got 100% discount in any shop"" [/spoiler]. There are some stuff in there that are very much enjoyable.

The mechanichs for the bidding are chaotic, wich is good, because bidding with people is chaotic. Another funny moment [spoiler] i won a bidding and a guy named ""BiddingMaster"" just dropped dead on the floor [/spoiler].

Overall this game is quite enjoyable, not a precious gem, not a brain bluster, but is good. In the spot where it pass it but with some *.

The game is worth in the sale, above 30% i would say, but no the full price.
I'm eager to see te continuation of this game and the full potential.

Side note: the car control physics are way too good for this game, wich is kind of funny, but is only that, the acceleration is just 0-100 in 1s, the turn is pretty open, but you get that feeling ""man this game is not ment to have this"". It's weird.

Resume: This game is weird, is neither terrible or excelent, is just ok.

You can buy new houses and cars with your hard earned profits, and do a little gambling on slots and blackjack if you feel like it!

At the moment there are some optimisation issues and crashes but the dev is actively working on these issues and seems to be very hands on with players in his Discord server.

29169,"Not worth $11, BUT, pay attention to the obvious jank present in even the promo video and you probably understand what you're getting into. So, the review is based off of you already seeing and accepting that.

I've got 4h in this game and see no reason to go back until something game changing has been added. Owning all the vehicles, homes, and basically having enough money to just quickbuy every acution at the highest tier storage place is easy. As lon as you're within about $50 up or down of the price, there is someone who will give you an offer within about 10s of you putting it up. Once you get the repair tools, everything is always perfect quality for zero cost.

About all you're hunting for at that point is the legendary items so you're making the most bang for your buck.

Honestly, if they gave some tradeoff for repairing items or actually made you have to put forward some effort to keep your stuff moving then it may hold attention longer ... but until then, its okay for what it is, just wait for the sale.",1
29170,"It's in early access, so play at your own peril I guess.  The game is buggy, especially when it comes to graphics and item physics.  That's to be expected.  But there are a lot of other things that are just too much of a barrier for me to want to keep playing the game at this point.  

The biggest issue by far is the save game mechanism.  You have to transport all of your items back to your house and store them in your garage or they just disappear and you lose everything.  This means that I can't just save and stop playing when I want/need to go do something else.  No, I have to go through the time consuming process of transporting and unloading every single item I've purchased first.

And that doesn't even always work!  There's a bug that seems to just randomly occur where the game upon loading resets to some earlier autosave instead of your most recent save and so all the items in your garage are gone.  I've lost literally hundreds of thousands of in-game dollars on this!  That was the final straw for me.

Until they change the save mechanism, I can't say I'd recommend this game and I don't even know if I'll be playing again myself.",0

  when you start a new day, stuff you put into your car falls randomly out or through the car, 
  you can¬¥t place bets at a yardsale, items in your garage dissapears, sometimes you don¬¥t 
  get the right amount of money when you sell anything and so on
- There are very limited options in the options menu. You can¬¥t change the mouse sensetivity 
  or keybindings
- There is no backgroundmusic
- The carengine sound is litterly too quiet
- The sound of the storage seller sounds like he¬¥s in a church or something. That does not 
  match with the place we¬¥re standing on
- The graphictextures has some serious issues. Looks like made in paint sometimes and just 
  put right next to each other or something
- People walk randomly on the street for no reason
- Everything looks so bland
- The storages looks all the same. Not like in the video shown on the storepage. Crap lies 
  randomly around and you don¬¥t get nice or cool items out of it. At least not while I was 
  playing. Combined with the bug where you don¬¥t get the right amount of money when you 
  sell anything, well that doesn¬¥t make any fun. Your just losing money.
- On the PC the text the buyers sent to you are so random and it looks like they only got 3 or 
  4 different lines in total and thats it
- Almost all the npc¬¥s look the same. Its like they onley made 3 or 4 different models

I know it¬¥s EA but this is more like a pre pre pre alpha at best.

At it¬¥s current state I can¬¥t recommened it. I would say wait a year or two and see what they do with the game. thats why I sent a refund. I¬¥ll keep this game in mind tho.

I really don¬¥t want to make the devs unhappy with my review. It¬¥s just my point of view and I really hope that they get all the bugs fixed, polish the game and bring frequently updates. It could be one of the best games in that genre if the devs work hard on it.",0
29173,"This game is really well done but suffers from some problems.

It needs better optimisation since it can get pretty choppy especially when driving, even on a high end gaming rig.  The game can freeze and crash, but it doesn't seem to happen very frequently, maybe once every 3 times you play.  The first time I bought the van and sold my truck, the game crashed and my van was completely gone when I reloaded the game, leaving me without a vehicle so I had to restart from the beginning.

There are a few other small issues, but this game has some serious potential and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

Some cool things about the game:
- You can buy a few houses
- The auctions are fun
- Discovering new items and their prices are fun
- Being able to repair items so they make a bit more money is cool
- Seems to be a pretty decent list of items to obtain so far
- There is a fair with some fun and challenging games you can drive to
- It's open world (even though it's a bit tiny)
- You can buy cars, trucks and vans (only a few, not many)
- You can haggle for better prices

Things that would be great if they were added to the game
- More vehicles - ex. a moving truck, luxury cars
- A bigger map
- More items in each store since most seem pretty empty
- New storage locations
- Item visuals get better as they are repaired
- More items to find
- Better optimisation

Is the game worth buying?  Yes, this game has it's issues, but it's addictive, and adds a great game to your collection of simulators.",1
29174,"love it when the most expensive item from the unit falls out of the map. Also love it when there is a loss on a unit.

Auto saves on a loss too.",0
29175,"I often attend warehouse auctions. I'm addicted to the thrill, and this game has been a lifesaver for me. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a warehouse full of my grandmother's sweatpants, paying for this game was the best deal I've ever made.",1
29176,The game is definitely not bad for an early access game. The content is really fun and there is lots of cool stuff to discover. Kudos!,1
29177,"i've tried, i really did, but after my (above average) pc crashing multiple times i just can't recommend this game. until it is fixed of course.",0
29178,"I was gonna recommend this game but after playing for 17 hrs since i bought it, it was a great game. 
Yes it has bugs but it was till fun to play and I really enjoyed it. 

Then out of nowhere the game crashed. every time I try to play it, it crashes at the loading screen. 
Bought it played it for 3 days and now its the second day I have yet been able to play. 
I checked Discussions and I see its biggest issues is game crashes. I wrote a discussion and Dev replied but one reply in two days without an answer doesn't help. 

So i ended up buying a game I cannot play now and past its refund policy. 
I feel scammed. I'll edit review if I could play cause if it weren't the issue of unable to play this game would have been great. 

note bugs are fine in game with what they have its do-able. but a paid game you can't play cause of crashes is not a game.

look at discussion it will show crashes are the biggest issues that has detoured players.

29179,"I don't want to write a bad review about this game, but I have to.
If you're looking for a game that involves auctions, finding items and selling them, then sure, this might be your kind of game. HOWEVER, do not expect a game that's got good qualities. With all due respect, not only a similar roblox game have even more customization than this, but also have better item designs than this. The mapping itself looks like someone went into a map builder, built a residential area with a few storage areas, and that's it.
",0
29180,I don't know why but the game crashes hard on me to the point i have to force restart my computer. I thought it was because i was tabbing out of the game but i played for 40 mins without clicking out of the game and it crashed. happened 3 times and struggled to set my resolution.,0
29181,"For an early access game I'm having fun with this one. Still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out. If the Devs stay up on it, it can turn into a really good game.",1
29182,"Love the game!

I do hope in the future there will be more cars and houses, a flashlight would be nice for working in the dark. As well as better decoration option (like a snap to grid or something).

But overall, love love love it. It has kept me busy for a couple of hours",1
29183,Good but not Great game as it does have its bugs being early access at the time but the concept is great behind it and is just the mobile game bid wars but honestly slightly better. Keep it up guys.,1
29184,"got 7 hours out of the game, so not bad buy for ¬£10, defo worth a buy, the game can defo have some simple things added to make it more ongoing and progressive, pawn shop, more rare items, pokemon cards, graded video games, signed",1
29185,"Very addictive mini game fun n simple buy and sell storage's make profits buy better car to help transport home to make the cash. 
I would recommend this not complicated looking forward to what the developer adds to the game in the future.",1
29186,"Very fun and addicting game, but there's just not enough content to play it for very long. Needs more progression for late game.
Edit: Somehow genuinely won $336 MILLION off the slot machine, didn't even think that was possible. Had saved up like $400k and was just auto spinning, then my game froze and when it came back i had $336,391,800...

",1
29187,"Fun game. Needs more Balanced game play,bigger world, multiplayer would make this game go far. With more storage games coming out at the time of this review updates are needed for it to survive. as it stands 5 ranking i give it 3.5.",1
29188,"Definitely is satisfying to my storage battle type craving. I have to limit myself on a few things to keep it enjoyable. I don't gamble in case I win too much, and I don't auto buy storage bids. Having a balance between garage sales for mild profit and the gamble of storage units for larger profit/loss keeps things feeling just right. The only goals that fuel the game for me are tool upgrades, maybe a bigger garage, and a vehicle that can haul a lot more back at once. The bugs are few to none that I've had to encounter. Sure some NPC audios could be more updated but the captioned lines aren't terrible. It's amusing to hear men make a womanly call out and vise versa. Then again, the call outs NPCs make don't feel in character to a bid battle. Usually people say ""Here"" or something and these guys are going ""YAHOO"" like aight buddy I know you're excited but it aint over yet lol. Idk. You can tell it's unique and luckily unique is what helps keep loyalty. I even like some of the buyer personalities. keep adding those unique touches dev! Like the gorilla haha and the funny af names of the competitive buyers. Keep that up and I really hope to see this game flesh out!!!",1
29189,"Storage Hustle, my current go-to for that Storage Wars thrill, comes with its fair share of quirks. In the vast expanse of Early Access, the price tag aligns with the potential, especially if you're knee-deep into the storage unit hustle.

Bidding has that authentic feel, even if some folks seriously lowball their loot. Haggling offers its own kind of joy, but tread carefully ‚Äì push too hard, and you might earn someone's lasting annoyance. Skee-yee! Now, the physics dance on a thin line between predictability and chaos. Ever wonder if your digital haul would randomly explode off your truck? It's a bit like contemplating dinner plans mid-game. stomach growls

Speaking of which, I've been navigating Storage Hustle's world with the perpetual curiosity about my next meal. Skee-yee! This isn't just about lunch or dinner; it's a wandering thought ‚Äì could Cesar's culinary wizardry conjure up something delightful tonight? Ah, the enigma of gastronomic exploration.

But, back to the game. Skee-yee! A glaring gripe here ‚Äì the absence of a skills tutorial. ""i"" for skills? It took me a digital eternity to unravel that mystery. A small on-screen hint or an initial tutorial could have spared me some button-mashing frustration. Skee-yee! Perhaps Cesar has a recipe for gaming enlightenment?

And let's not forget the Mercy mains of Storage Hustle ‚Äì quirky, a tad frustrating, but not without their unique charm. Skee-yee! It's a shared sentiment, not animosity. Anyway, I'm thinking about dinner plans now... maybe Cesar has a suggestion. In a nutshell, Storage Hustle, with its hiccups and quirks, is a virtual journey into the chaotic world of storage wars, all while contemplating the profound mysteries of both digital adventures and culinary delights. Skee-yee! stomach growls louder",1
29190,"this game is far far better than i ever expected it to be lmao. i am absolutely hooked and having a great time with it. it's a bit janky but that adds to the charm. i could see it getting a bit old eventually but so far it's a ton of fun. here's my video on it if you feel like getting a better look at what it's like

29191,"This game really looks good to play i've played it for awhile til the game started freezing up so bad where i couldn't hardly play it, then it locked up lol But if this game works and plays good for other people then i recommand this game to anyone who like anything to do with storage wars.",1
29192,"I got alot of enjoyment out of this game to be honest, but also alot of frustration when it came to loading, rendering and crashing, which did happen every time I played. The game definitely feels like it is in early access, so keep that in mind. The actual game play though was great, there is alot that can be added and polished, but it was alot of fun to go through the storage units and decide on prices, the quick sell option later in the game is a godsend really. There are no real quests, I just focused on the achievements as a 'guide'. (Augh and there's one I cant get to save my life for some reason yet)  All in all, at this stage in the game, I would recommend you get this game on sale if you can, and dont forget to send bug reports to help them flush things out. :)",1

29195,"I wish this was a positive review because it has a lot of potential. I get it is an early access game, yet, I should atleast be able to play it. I've never, since i have had this steam account, requested a refund until now. I'm very disappointed, especially with the potential this game has. Maybe one day, when it is complete, will i try it again. Until then, this was a disappointment.",0
29196,"Like a typical early access game, doesn't run smoothly even on a powerful system, I will say though this runs terribly. Very glitchy and just runs awful. A good attempt at a game and at least got it on sale. Game constantly crashes, have all drivers up to date, RTX 4070 super with a 14th gen i7, plently enough computer to run and it is just laggy with everything. Game mentions gender stuff, it isn't something to put into games simple as that, instant review for that.",0
29197,"Great Game! A few suggestions...when tipping over cardboard box, things should fall out. When hitting pedestrians, lose money over lawsuit. More homes for sale. More vehicles for sale. Restore vehicles from bad to perfect. Restoration should cost money.
Just a few ideas...it is addicting to play though, for those of us who like games where we ""make money"".",1
29198,"So i totally understand that is early access and i am curious to see where this is ending. But right now I can not recommend and will refund.

The game crashes on me frequently while driving back to my garage after Auctions as if the stuff in the back is bugging out and then the game shuts down. Here we go same day starting again. But I think that the Experience is not reset so atleast you got that going.

The auctions are really annoying:
-Weird noises from the NPC buyers
-Waiting for 8 Seconds between each bid is to long for me

Selling the stuff works really well, kinda like that part. 
Driving is weird, should be reworked

But the game is just not enjoyable for me the way it is now.

29199,"game crashes frequently when trying to sleep to the next day. didn't happen until i started collecting items to decorate my house, i think theres an issue with how many items are in the world and being loaded the next day. or its just poorly optimized and im overthinking it.",0
29200,"Orginal POST:
Good Price point equals good start! Storage Hustle has loads of BUGS and minor annoyances, however can be fun if and when exploited them. If the Developer(s) keep the fixes and updates coming, Storage Hustle will certainly be a GRINDY ADDICTION!

UPDATE on May 18th 2024
I am sorry but this game is plagued with BUGS, while I enjoy the concept. I think I will drop this one. GOOD LUCK

It may not crash like some people write in their reviews, but when it comes to optimization, the game can indeed stutter, so it's very weak at this aspect.

29206,"An alright jigsaw game with cute cats with color splashes (as the title implies) as the images. There is 50 different jigsaws ranging from 9 to 49 pieces.

I encountered 2 issues with it:
- The sound mute button only mutes the music, you can still hear the sound effects
- The sensitivity as to when it detects a piece in the correct location is way too low, so sometimes you will find yourself spam placing a piece 5 pixels up and down till the game will finally register it as correct.

It work without any issues on Linux with Proton (8.0-3)",1

29208,"Took me nearly 100 minutes to finish all of the puzzles.
Sadly doesn't give a lot of replayability, but its some puzzle fun for a short time, if you are bored.

I think it is worth its price for a 1-hour puzzle game from an indie developer. 7/10.",1
29210,Fun puzzle games where the puzzles have more pieces the further you go. 50 levels of puzzle with good background music. I enjoyed it a lot!,1
29211,"This is lovely. I'm enamoured by the gorgeous cats covered in vibrant colours. The overall design is well made, with the puzzle inside a picture frame,  the colourful background, even the mouse is colourful!

I liked the warped shapes of the puzzle pieces and the gradual increase in size. Starts off small with 9 pieces, then 25, then 49, so far. I'm currently on level 41 and looking forward to seeing if the final puzzle is going to be an even bigger size. Aren't I greedy!

I also enjoy spending time in the gallery. Here you can sit back and admire all your beautiful cats.

29216,"KINDA recommend (depending what kind of game you're after). Not bad if you like Tetris-type games. It is a bit more relaxed, because the blocks aren't falling. Also, this is not a flashy, fancy Tetris game.

You basically have what I'll call ""city blocks,"" all of which are mini Tetris boards. But instead of filling in a line, you fill in the ""city block."" You can drop the pieces anywhere you rotate and set them, and you have 30 seconds to position the piece and set it, which isn't hard at all if you have played much Tetris. You can get ""caught"" because if you drop a piece on one board, and it is sticking into another ""city block,"" it will drop the spare piece there. But that is also part of how you play, so it's not bad or good to do that, but it can trip you up.

I would say only get the game if you want a relaxing Tetris-y puzzler. I will play it more if I remember, but I have too many games to play, and I gotta be in a ""Tetris mood"" to really get into these types.

TBH, reminds me of a ""classicy board game"" phone game. I play Reversi and Checkers a ton on my phone because it's pretty easy and occupies my brain. This game doesn't play like Reversi, but it has that same ""I can let my brain do other stuff while I occupy myself"" kind of feel. I was gonna play for like 5 minutes on the tutorial and ended up playing half an hour, but I didn't feel the need to play for 5 hours either. So kinda like Reversi or Checkers in that regard.

Anyway, if you want a slower ""old man game,"" give it a go. If not, stay clear, because you're not gonna get Godzilla coming to tear down your city, or an epic quest or anything like that. You just move blocks. That's it.",1

29219,"Straightforward first-person shooter that delivers some mindless fun for an hour or two.

The plot is somewhat weird and revolves around the cryptocurrency topic, a generic booze-guzzling badass and a Russian bear general. After being attacked by space pirates, the guys decide to take matters into his own hands and eradicate them.

The game employs the old-school structure. This involves a stage loaded with enemies in each room and the occasional keycard that must be found in order to access the colored doors. There‚Äôs also money you can grab but there appears to be no purpose behind it.

The enemy variety is limited and lacks excitement. They're all very mindless. You have big spacesuit guys who die in one shot, thin soldiers with glowing eyes and jumping soldiers whose behavior remind me of people in multiplayer games. It‚Äôs hard to hit them because they keep jumping around and moving. They're also bullet sponges, meaning they don't respond when shot. Headshots do not exist in this game, and the only indication that your bullets hit is some kind of liquid erupting from enemies.

You have three weapons to take out the enemy: a powerful pistol, a machine gun, and a scoped rifle. Limited ammo is never an issue because you‚Äôll die before you get to waste all of it. However, the game is almost casual because you simply can‚Äôt lose. When you die, you respawn with all of your ammo and health at the last checkpoint. Dead foes remain dead, and you may simply pick up where you left off.

The biggest criticism is that the game must be completed in a single sitting. You are unable to save or continue. The game isn't long because there are around six stages, which takes around 1-2 hours, however it crashed twice and caused me to restart.",1
29220,"Solid game right here. Off the bat I dont like how ya can't adjust the music volume..it's a bit too loud. Other than that, the gunplay is solid when you aren't dealin' with jumpy enemies. The story seems to be parodying crypto concept and the mining that comes with it perhaps. I appreciate that it features voice actin'. Plus points for that. Not bad for the price. 

Gameplay here: https://youtu.be/fUmWTyY9K1U",1
29221,"Not very good. No impact on the shooting. Enemies don't react till they die. Power ups don't seem to work at all. Not sure what picking up money was used for. Enemy variety boils down to 3 types. No boss battles. Can be beaten in an hour though my game crashed twice on my playthrough when transitioning between levels.

My only positive is that story wise I thought it was pretty funny because of how incoherent and purposley stupid it is.",0
29222,"I have been eagerly anticipating this title, and I can confidently say it has not disappointed me in the slightest. Allow me to share my experience with you in this thrilling game.
Graphics and Visual Design (5/5): The visual retro aspect of Revenge of ILCOIN  is simply stunning. The details in the environments, weapons, and characters are amazing. Every corner of the battlefield feels authentic, from the war-torn wreckage to the sunlight streaming through the trees. The visual effects in gunfire and explosions are so realistic that I sometimes found myself in awe of the beauty amidst the chaos.
Gameplay (4.5/5): The gameplay  is its strong suit. The controls are precise and responsive, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the action without feeling any disconnect between what you're trying to do and what happens on the screen. The maps are varied and strategic, encouraging dynamic gameplay and keeping you on your toes at all times. 
Story and Campaign Mode (4/5): The story in the campaign mode is intriguing. Although it may not be the game's standout feature, it offers a solid narrative and interesting characters that keep you engaged. If you're a fan of storytelling in FPS games, you will definitely enjoy the experience.
Sound and Soundtrack (4.5/5): The soundtrack fits the action perfectly and creates an intense atmosphere. The sound effects are realistic and further immerse you in the experience. The sound of weapons, and character voices are of high quality and add significant value to the game.
In summary, Revenge of ILCOIN  is a triumph in the first-person shooter genre. With its stunning graphics, solid gameplay, and a well-constructed world, this game is a gem for action enthusiasts. While no game is not perfect, it comes remarkably close to perfection and offers what all we wanted ‚Ä¶ fun. So, join the battle and get ready to experience an epic journey on the battlefield!

29225,"Started sometime in 2023: HI!!! I am going to update my review as a I play it because I am really bad at bullet hell games!! this is so funny and cute so far I will try my best to complete it!!!

4/6/24 I am back! I FINALLY defeated the cow, and that transition into space is SICK!! Waiting until the circular platform did the trick for my re-spawning issues. I felt so accomplished defeating that freaking alien cow!! I ended up beating that section using my xbox controller, it was easier to aim the dodges and land on the platforms, only issue with controller is that it does not interact with the user interfaces. An easy solution for that is by using the commonui plugin, its free on the epic store (if this was made with unreal engine). I am onto the pirate bay section. I haven't defeated the octopus yet, the fourth phase caught me off guard, I have gotten close several times though! 

So far I overall enjoy the wackiness of the game! It runs super well, and is optimized great. It has a good amount of challenge to it, but with determination you can overcome it. The different phases of the boss battles are interesting and cool! I like how you can shoot additional objects to get some relief from the bullet hell. It also allows different strategies, like if I should focus on the additional chaos or focus on damaging the boss versus taking it slow and focusing on dodging. I also like the little side objectives you can do while exploring the different areas. Honest rating 10/10!

06/07/2024 i AM BACK... I got a new computer and had to restart though. This play through was using mouse and keyboard. Tutorial boss still kicked my ass. I was able to get past the cow faster. I finally beat the pirate area. Now this mofo skull bald headed bytch UGH I will DESTROY him ISTFG, I have 9/10 stars. I am determined to beat this game even if it takes me until 2025",1

But there were sometimes the gameplay was a bit hard to control, and every time I fall into the lava, I don't know how to get back up, so it kind of sucks dying at the end because you made a mistake. This game is still super fun, this is basically cuphead in 3D.",1

29236,"Opened the game and immediately proceeded to blow myself off of a mountain. 10/10 would recommend.

For real though, the game is awesome. It's crazy to see something like this made by one guy. Support this developer, so they can keep making awesome games!",1
29237,Really enjoying this so far! Reminds me of worms. Landing those bombs was challenging but lot of fun. Sometimes i feel like enemies survived standing on single pixel though :D,1
29238,"The game is tough, but it's fun. I had a blast playing it. You gotta be smart about where you put your towers, or else you'll lose. It's not a game where you can just slap down towers and expect to win. It's awesome, but it's more for people who like to think things through and pay attention to the details.",1
29239,"Game is still too hard for the idea being sold. If it was called Brutal Tower Defense or Very Specific Strategy Tower Defense, maybe... But ""cozy"" implies a somewhat low stress experience. Happy to change my rating if further balancing is done. Graphics, sound, vibes are on point. Gameplay is frustrating here, and I own and play plenty of TD games. Would also be nice to speed up waves, if that function is present, it isn't obvious.",0
29240,"The game is extremely hard. The developer made the mistake that he built the difficulty around his knowledge of the game mechanics and since he knows his game well, it's not difficult him to beat any level. Because of this the even the very first level is hard to beat. I cannot recommend the game to anyone until the difficulty won't be ironed out.",0
29241,"A really great game in which you sink into. You have to think carefully about which towers and buildings you build so that you don't stand there without money or material. The music and the graphic style live up to the name ""cozy."" Great pastime 10/10",1
29242,"The resource system is not easy to understand at first. But as soon as you understand in which order and where you have to build your buildings, it's fun to develop strategies for the next rounds. After about four hours, I played through the initial four levels.

For beginners, I would recommend playing each level and unlocking perks. This makes it easier to defeat the bosses on each level.

I would love to see more levels, enemies and defenses in the future.",1
29243,This game is literally unplayable. An hour in and I haven't been able to get pass the easiest level on round 2. Its literally impossible.,0
29244,"I really feel at peace playing this game. Thank you so much for this game, sure it takes for strategic thinking but that makes it even better cause you can just dive into the game and not think about anything else :))",1
29245,"pretty fun game only have 2 complaints
1. this may just be me having a game journalist moment but in the tutorial it didn't make it apparent that to get the text that lets you know how to play was to press W.
2. when in lower resolutions the screen doesn't properly configure in the pause menu.
despite those minor nitpicks the game is  fun!",1
29246,"For the first game from this developer, it's got a great atmosphere and concept behind it. Can't wait to see what the Dev does next :)",1
29247,"I enjoyed the game, would be cool to have a challenge mode or some such though. Lvl 18 was my favorite for this reason as well as those with map elements that encouraged speed. All in all it was pretty nice and chill. Def good for an hour or so.

",1
29248,"Pretty cool game! Its giving me similar vibes to fire boy and water girl, in a good way.
There were a few sections that felt tricky playing as a solo player. 
I really like the secretive theme around the final level, but I almost didn't even play it! I went into the chapter select only to finish the last collectible I missed, but the ending of level 17 wouldn't have led me to believe there was anything left to do.
Overall, I had a good time with it and it was refreshing to play a simple puzzle game that didn't get bogged down with ads or unneeded complexity c:
I'm excited to see what else you work on!",1
29249,"The game is cute, fun and simple. Other games attempt to make it a challenge or video game logic to beat the game. It's 
a simple game meant to be enjoyed. The designs are bright and fun. I really hope the developer continues with this project because it a refreshing to play a game. Games are meant to be fun. This game simplistic fun at its finest. ^.^",1
29250,"I've been following the development of this game for a while now, and it's great to finally get to play it! It's a really enjoyable experience with some satisfying puzzles and a great atmosphere.",1

29260,Consistent and appealing art style with a fun gameplay loop. Easy to understand the core mechanics and a multitude of ways to play. Great start for an indie game developer on Steam!,1
29261,"A very fun game, and given I've gotten 8 hours out of there first two levels plus the replayability that is apparent from the start I could see this game lasting for a long time for the right people, and given it's price it's certainly worth a try.",1
29262,"Really fun! There's a lot more to the levels than I initially expected, and the attachments are getting more and more interesting as I've been going along. Fantastic job!",1
29263,I was super excited for this game and i'm glad it finally came out! My record so far is almost 1250 points. THE HOMER AND SABER UNITS ARE SO FUN. Also the unique soundtrack is great! Definitely get this if you are looking for hours of fun with an indie tower defense game.,1
29264,"Welcome back Punk!
Excellent DLC, the first one in a long time where i actually want to use all of the new wrestlers in my Universe mode.

If you have blood turned on in the settings during Sandman's entrance he will bust himself open on the way to the ring like in RL, what a train wreck of a human being. I love that they thought to add this detail.
No Enter Sandman entrance theme music though sadly.",1
29265,"Just expected a couple of characters for this update/dlc, very much pleased to have also the inclusion of new weapons! Hope the other dlcs include added features!",1
29266,"Only have it because I have the Wrestlemania edition. Personally, this pack is worth it whether you just want actual CM Punk or love classic ECW. Only downside is no Tommy Dreamer. How could you have the Sandman and not Tommy Dreamer?

Would've got it, even if it was not included in my purchase.",1
29267,"Is it worth 10 dollars? Debatable, but out of all the first few packs for this game, this is definitely the one that's most worth that price regardless. You've got your classic hardcore icons, several new weapons you can have under the ring like a door or a tube light, you can now add Cult Of Personality to the songs that play when you're navigating through menus. Hell, The Dudley Boys even have a specific unique tag team champs entrance made for them. Regardless of what mode I'm playing, it feels like having these additions to the roster actually spice up gameplay choices in a fun way.

Now, if only they'd done this with the two packs that followed this and things would be okay right now, but that's just not how it worked out, was it?",1
29268,"It's a great expansion pack.

If you go to bandcamp you can get this album for 1/10th the price and get the FLAC files in addition. And if you just want the Mp3 files you can get the album for free there. If you want to give the artist money, there is an option in bandcamp to give the artist as much money as you want. The only reason to buy this is to have the soundtrack in your steam library.

I HIGHLY recommend this soundtrack though, go check it out on bandcamp! I recommend looking on bandcamp for a lot of soundtracks on steam because you can sometimes find soundtracks that are cheaper than even their discounted prices such as this one.",0

For starters, the game is very dark with no way to brighten it, which makes it very hard to navigate, even with the sonar. A better flashlight of some sort would be nice, just for interior spaces at the very least, as the one you do get is very weak and kinda easy to miss.
It's very hard to actually get started, and some of the objectives are a little hard to actually do when you get them, given how little oxygen you get (Plus I still don't know how to get zinc) The oxygen recycler didn't seem to help at all either, even with two of them. The sonar can also be a little buggy with the rangefinder at times.

The main draw of the game, the black hole itself, is very nice and absolutely terrifying. I was frozen in fear when I first noticed ""Hey, that black hole looks a lot bigger than it did before.""
Overall, neat little game with a few hours of fun",1
29332,"Slowly trundled to my ship, it crashed, everything went dark so couldn't see anything, inventory doesn't have and won't let me build the oxygen tank, seems to be nothing else to find, locked in a room simulator. Maybe I'm thick but feels more like this needs some onboarding.",0

Normally I have a really hard time giving a bad rating to a game that I didn't pay anything for. And in this case, I'm somehow even more sorry since it's the developer's very first game.

But, as much as I'm sorry, no, I can't recommend the game under any circumstances. Not only for the following reasons but also because of the price, which in my opinion is significantly too high. I may be the first to write a bad review for the game, but I can well imagine that there will be one or two buyers who, after purchasing it, will see it as a ‚Äúrip-off‚Äù for what it offers.

When I received the game, I looked at it briefly on an office notebook and I thought, OK, it looks pretty nice, even though it took forever to load the game and I wasn't able to use the game because of performance issues kept getting stuck and jerking. I didn't think anything of it and blamed it more or less on the notebook, even though it's not a bad one and other games work on it without any problems.

Today, on my main gaming computer, with which I can play any AAA game in the best graphics quality in 4k without any problems, things were similar with loading and area changes. After starting the game, I was afraid that my graphics card was broken because the picture was so crooked and it seemed like there were color errors. I didn't take a screenshot because, if I'm honest, I didn't want to post a screenshot like that.
You can see what I mean in the following screenshot and if you look closely, then you might know or understand what I mean.

It may be that this is intentional, but I find it really terrible and incredibly tiring to look at such pictures all the time and I can't do anything with it.

I've made the effort to actually watch and play through the entire game from start to finish but I can't find anything where I can say, well done. The pictures remind me a little of a toddler who can't paint yet. Sure, it can be a style that can be quite interesting, but then something is missing in the implementation and these disturbing color errors or whatever you want to call them shouldn't be there in my opinion. And I think, as someone else also wrote, the cats are kind of ugly. Well, they are cats that were turned into stones and you have to turn them back with a click, but after that a pretty, cute or whatever cat would have been nicer and not a cat stone. Sure, it somehow fits with the overall picture, but still...

Some of the puzzles contained in the game are not that easy and you don't always immediately understand what you are supposed to do. Since I wasn't very happy with the game anyway, I looked for a guide, which luckily exists. The guide itself is written by the developer. I find that very commendable and it is also very helpful, but I also wonder whether it is good to offer a complete solution and also with a map to find your way around. If you can't find the solution after x attempts, you'll probably use a guide to help you, but it's kind of difficult because it seems to me like you're trying to prevent people from not finishing the game and possibly getting upset about it excite. A guide with tips without a concrete solution might have been a little better. If you use the guide it is not difficult to unlock the achievements. Otherwise, things could get a little tricky.

The menu offers a few settings intended for the comfort of the game and you can choose between windowed and full-screen mode. You can also adjust the sound and effects separately. The background music is actually quite relaxed, but like everything, it's purely a matter of taste. I personally find the effects and the meowing terrible.
Unfortunately there are no settings for display or quality. The operation itself works quite well, but the view or movement of the image is a bit strange. Static but somehow shifted by the ‚Äúcamera angle‚Äù. I don't know how to explain this exactly. It may be that I'm now spoiled by really good HOG games and their functions.

The idea behind it and the basic concept is not bad, even if it is reminiscent of existing and well-known games in many ways.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough to be positive about it and I specifically asked a few people around me what they thought of this game. And to put it briefly and simply, the answer was unanimous: nothing. I'm really sorry.

You can find a different and definitely positive perspective on this game for example [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198161853963/recommended/2528710/]here[/url]

is a cute and very relaxing ,,hidden things'' point & click cat adventure in 3D.  You can gather 17 archievements at this point, they do not count at the moment on profile, but will when steam validet the game! 

In this game all cats have turned to stone. You have to find an click on them to safe them. So we go into the Town on our mission to safe the cats! 

They are slightly visible, so you might think -at the first look- all cats are easy to find, but thats not true. Some of the cats are very well hidden. You have to literaly check everywhere for them. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3074144904

There are a few other riddles in this game, to make it complete. The riddles are not easy and in my opinion challenging to do, it was really refreshing! 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3074145149

One of the best thing is, you can literally pet every cat ingame and the Dev really named EVERY cat in the game. This really adds a personal touch! <3 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3074145072

The game is a references to the Devs hometown in Australia and an ode to his own pets, who are great voice-actors for this game! As a first game from this Dev, i am impressed! Its filled with a lot of details and love. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did!

If you like my review, you may also like my curator page! I would be very happy for a follow‚ù§

29338,"I want to start by saying thank you so much to the dev (who worked solo on this game!) for the free copy for me to review!  I appreciate it so much!

That being said, I do recommend this game but I also have some caveats and suggestions for how it could be improved!

THE GOOD STUFF:

- I am a big fan of indie games, of cat games and of hidden object games so this was like a wonderful trifecta of those things for me.  I think this is a very impressive first game, truly. When I went to check out the devs other stuff, I was a little surprised to find that this is all they had done so far because, while Meowing Point isn't perfect and still needs a bit of polish, it feels a bit more experienced than a first (solo!!) game.

- I spent a little over an hour in this game and while I didn't 100% it, and I don't know how close I got to finding every single cat (more on that later) I feel satisfied with my experience in the game.

- The cats are not ""hidden"" in the traditional way.  In fact, they are more or less right out in the open but they are presented as blank 3d models in a 3d space you can move around in and when you click on the blank model, it ""fills it in"".  This is deceptively easy at first. You start happily clicking away and revealing cat after cat.  But it's not long before you realize you're having to struggle a little to find more.  And when you think you've clicked on them all but it doesn't give you the area complete message....you really have to start keeping your eyes peeled.  Some of them were really very challenging to find.  And the fact that I did NOT find every single cat in my run, is proof that it isn't that easy.

- There were multiple different areas to work in, and you can travel easily back and forth between them, should you decide that you'd like to move on to another space before finishing the one you're at.

- The style is simple, but cute enough! 

- While I initially thought I'd find this entirely too easy, it ended up being a decent challenge as mentioned above.

- It plays some really fantastic throw back music (reminded me a lot of very early Final Fantasy music) and I love that it displays on the screen what the track is!

- There are some pleasant surprises here in the form of unexpected ""side quests"".  I discovered rather randomly some items by clicking on them and realized eventually there was a use for those items.  One item leads to another, and I won't spoil anything but it was a nice addition to this game.

- Every single cat had a name.  Adds nothing to the gameplay, but I loved it :)


THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF/SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

- The font for the title/logo of this game is so hard to read and definitely needs a change

- The price point of this game is too high.  There's an argument to be had regarding what indie devs DESERVE to make vs what we want to spend as gamers, but the truth is that for an experience that will land many people in the 1-2 hour time frame, the current price point of 6.66 is way beyond what most of us would justify.  For a lot of games like this, we're looking more in the 99cents-2.99 range.

- I have no idea what the ""ending"" of this game was.  It went from hidden cat game to weird clicker for a brief moment and I didn't care for that part of it

- There's nothing wrong with the black cats in the game, the model is very cute.  However, it would be cool to see other kitties!  Some variation in the cats would be nice.

- There is no hint in this game.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but hints can be useful and do tend to be a staple in the hidden object genre.  On that same note, I'd like to see a counter maybe at the top of each area denoting how many cats I've found vs how many there are, rather than a sum total of cats found in the game so far, which is what is currently displayed.


TLDR - overall I recommend Meowing Point if you like relaxing hidden object games but only if you can get it at a much lower price point.  This is a good first game for the dev and I think it was a fun entry into the casual indie game genre.

29339,"Another ""find cats"" game that tries to add a personal touch. 

You move around by using a mouse. Although you can travel between screens, you are not allowed to freely explore them because of a fixed camera. The only thing you can do is pan the screen by clicking and dragging. It is also possible to zoom in for a closer look, however this does not work around screen borders.

The objective is to locate all cats in all locations. Unlike in other similar games, the cats are prominent in this one. The environment does not conceal certain strange shapes that make you wonder if it's a cat at all. They've all been turned to stone, so they're simple to spot. Each cat has a name.

Some cats are better at hiding than others. This is why you should click on suspicious things like garbage cans and windows. You never know what you might see. You are also going to encounter tiny components of adventure games, such as picking up items and using them in the appropriate location. 

There are no hotspots, which is a pain, and you must hop through adventure nonsense. For example, a rock requires a specific pickaxe and not the ones laying near to the rock. When you find all of the cats on a location, you get a star and can move on. But since there are no hints, finding that one last cat is always frustrating. 

One nitpicking issue is that available exits should be marked more clearly. While it‚Äôs true that cursor changes when you point at it and there are traffic cones that mark end of the road, it‚Äôs still easy to miss a path or get lost.",1

Short, but entertaining hidden objects game in a 3D world where you need to find cats, complete quests and ... battle an evil tree in the lighthouse? That last part didn't really make sense to me either, so don't worry about it lol.

You move around the world with your mouse, you can zoom in and out, but you can't really turn the camera. The camera is mostly fixed angle that sometimes made it difficult to find all the cats. There also was no hint option, which was a little disappointing, but the cats were not all that difficult to find.

Every cat has a name and you can pet them! The story is almost non-existent and quite confusing, but honestly I don't really think this game even needed a story to begin with, but it is there, for what it's worth anyhow.

I really liked this hidden objects game, and will recommend it. The price of the game isn't really worth it imo, so wait for a sale for this one!",1
29341,Cats are evil but this was pretty cute. I think finding all the cats gave me an aneurysm,1
29342,"Overpriced and short, get it on the specials. Review Copy provided by dev.
An fun and unusual 3D exploration game where you have to find a load of petrified, yes petrified cats, you can pet them, but they are petrified, get it. Okay maybe not. Collect the stone cats, but be on the lookout for hidden cats, poke at things that look like they might have been put there, to unlock areas and doors Collect plastic bottles to recycle, and well to end the game, that would be a spoiler. Nothing too special, just the sudden end.

But it's a very short game.",1
29343,"[b]Meowing Point[/b] is a cute 3D hidden cat game from solo developer Yofransico. It is the creator‚Äôs first project and was originally made for a friend. Players must find and rescue hundreds of hidden cats that have been turned to stone.

It is an ambitious but enjoyable game, and very impressive as the developer‚Äôs first solo project. The hidden object aspect is well implemented and a lot of fun though more direction or hints would be a nice addition to the other activities rather than just have the player stumble across them. The aesthetic is unique and has a subtle retro feel to it and the visuals suit the style of the game well. The music is very nice, though some tracks fit better than others and there was some repetition. The clunkiness of the controls and navigation is probably the game‚Äôs weakest area and does put a bit of a dampener on an otherwise enjoyable experience. Currently, this game needs a bit more polish to justify its price tag. That being said, it is a cute, fun game with a decent amount of potential. On the game‚Äôs store page, the developer talks about working on additional areas, secrets, and polishing which is highly promising and certainly means that this is one to keep an eye on and I will tentatively recommend it with that in mind.

Meowing Point by Developer yofrancisco, a solo developer with his first game  

A short Point and Click exploration game, with hints and references to the developer's hometown in Australia. It has some slight puzzling with extra hidden objects. The developer, yofrancisco states he is working on additional free areas, secrets, and more polishing. If you're stuck, a story & achievement guide made by the developer can be found in the community section. The developer decided to give this a slightly moody color scheme.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3145715343

You move around the world using your mouse, you can zoom in and out, but you can't move the camera. There are no hints but the cats are usually not too difficult to find. Pet these kitties and you will find they have names. Yes, they each have a name! There are also some random side quests too, so be sure to pick up any suspicious objects that might be used later. You can click on suspicious things like garbage cans and windows. Some things might even unlock new areas and doors. You never know what you might find. There are a few riddles in this game and they can be somewhat challenging at times. Sometimes a rock requires a specific pickaxe and not the ones laying near the rock. When you find all of the cats on a location, you get a star and can move on. But since there are no hints, finding that one last cat (or last few) can be challenging and frustrating at times. I did get lost even though I tried following the map. It's probably just me, like usual. Cats are more on the ugly side (sorry) and very clever at hiding sometimes.

Final Thoughts:
Short, addicting and entertaining game with cats that have been turned to stone. Oh my! Help save our kitties! Price isn't too bad but getting it on sale is even better. Nice entertaining game considering it is the developer's 1st game. Nice addition to add to your library.

29345,"Looks like no one has reviewed this game recently so here goes:

For a first game by a solo dev, I say good job! It's a casual little point and click game where you find hidden cats that have turned to stone. They meow when you click them, and you can click them again to pet them (and it will tell you that cat's name which is cute). The cats can be tricky to find, which I appreciated as it didn't make it feel like I was wasting money by it being ""easy"". If you complete an area 100% it tells you in the upper left hand corner that you found all the cats, the most cats I've ever found was 634. And that was with me basically finding all cats in all areas except by the lighthouse! There are some neat references to actual places in Australia, which I enjoyed. You're able to change the window size, make it full screen, and adjust audio which I appreciate. There are achievements, which is pretty dope. Oh, and the dev published a guide themselves, can't say I've seen that before! It's not super thorough, but it helps if you get a bit stuck. 

Yes, there are some things that are a little finicky. I still say it's worth the money. Examples of fiddly bits: when you are about to glide your mouse over the entrance to a new area, the mouse and game lag a bit trying to load the animation of the cat walking/the light lighting up. No biggie. After the initial lag it doesn't seem to happen again. There are only a few songs, so they loop and I guess it could get annoying that they repeat (I still liked the music, it even tells you what song is playing as it changes). 

Overall, I got plenty of hours of play time in with this game. I'm happy with it, I look forward to seeing if the dev comes out with new content :)",1

29364,"7/10 A porn VN / texting game where you seduce you GF's 18 year old daughter.

Good:
- free
- an interesting idea to fit the whole story into an exchange on an instant messenger
- writing is pretty good and natural

So-so:
- the models of the girl look older than 18, more like 24-25, this mismatch was a bit irritating
- from the start, I didn't feel like I can't hit on this girl. I mean, according to the story, she is ""almost like my daughter"" but that's not really felt because the protagonist's actual (40+ year old) girlfriend isn't in the picture and there is no player's attachment to her. So, the initial daddy-like tone felt unnecessarily limiting. Thankfully, since I kept selecting the most ""sexy"" replies, I got to ending 4 which is where the protagonist has sex with the girl. I'd say, the story should have maybe had a message exchange with the girl's mom as well, to make the ""love triangle"" more real, so that it would matter to the player (?)

Bad:
- well, nothing... except it's short. However, it would get boring if it were any longer because this raw exchange of messages, even if there are a few erotic renders of 3D models in-between, can hold attention only for so long. I think I was starting to lose patience and more like skimming through text just about 50 messages  before the end of the game, so the pacing is about fine. Could still be shortened, to speed up tempo and be certain that it doesn't get boring before it ends.

Overall, it's an interesting mix of a VN and a texting simulator that's relatively novel. I recall 1 game from Nutaku that used the same technique but this game just has far better writing, so it's much better.

Found an error: ""How is any of that sexy?"" should be the guy's phrase, not the girl's.

You play the role of a boss who is responsible for introducing a new intern to the company. Sophie is her name, and it turns out she's really adept at her job. After a few work-related talks, you become more friendly, share personal information, and possibly something else.

The game tells a story in an interesting way. Everything is done via an app in which you exchange text messages and perhaps occasional photo. Instead of distracting you with boring gameplay, the entire product concentrates on delivering a story.

At various points, you will be able to respond to Sophie by selecting one of three options. Each option raises one of the three stats, which ultimately lead to different endings. You have three options: love, lust, or creep. Although there are two difficulty levels, it is recommended that you choose easy, which uses colors to match responses to stats.

It is a bargain but given there's only a few pics and a lot of speech bubbles full price is asking a bit.

The biggest frustration is that within an hour I'd got all 4 endings, which are just plain bad, they're technically all the same, it would've been nice to have seen some thing different, and despite multiple play thru's going thru love, corruption and slut several of the gallery elude me,  I suspect a bug maybe ?.

Graphics needs some work. There's a lot to see on the entire office floor, but you can't interact with anything. There are other issues as well. When you turn around, you can see right through walls since the camera is too near to the main characters. The most of the objects are solid, but a billiard table was most likely overlocked because you can walk directly through it. Furthermore, the view from the balcony is a clear 2D image slapped on the horizon.

It's a shame you can only interact with your computer. Even still, you have no control other than hiring the four girls and changing their clothes. The only other thing in the office are the staff with whom you can speak. However, they will all simply ignore you and claim to be working. 

The most important characters are the main girls. You need to talk to them constantly because they give you tasks. It doesn‚Äôt matter which one you go for because they all want the same thing. While nudity is completely absent from the game, you will see them in a swimsuit or sexy lingerie. 

Unfortunately, there isn't much of a game or content here. The only other options are the beach and your house, neither of which has any interaction points. You boost the value of your firm by fulfilling tasks for girls. This allows you to hire more assistants, but because there are only a few girls, you can do this in ten minutes.

29407,"If you've ever played or st33d's Ending and Nitrome's Rust Bucket (also designed by Aaron Steed), you know what you're in for.

The game's whole gimmick is that it's a roguelite turn based, tile based combat puzzle game with the twist that you can't move or attack diagonally and most importantly, you can't use a turn to sit still. This creates a lot of awkward situations where you have to find creative ways to waste turns without putting yourself at a disadvantage in order to allow enemies to put themselves in disadvantageous positions themselves. Most things die in one hit with enemies dying in 2 hits or being invincible being special gimmicks and enemy behaviour and the outcome of attacks are completely deterministic and very predictable. All the enemies are unique and the graphical style allows you to easily tell them apart and know how they behave and what their gimmicks are by just looking at them. This isn't without a bit of trial and error, however as you'll have to understand the visual design language the game uses through experience. 

Speaking of trial and error, the game in general is full of it. Thankfully, you can make as many mistakes as you want, including those that put you into a checkmate situation and undo your way all the way to the very first turn if you wish. Only some dungeons have limited/no undos as a special gimmick. It's a great way to allow the player to learn without frustration getting in the way as all mistakes you make just disappear at the press of a button. Though, if you've played turn based puzzle games with unlimited undos you'll know that this doesn't diminish their challenge. The puzzle levels show how each of the many interesting mechanics you'll encounter throughout the randomly generated dungeons can be used in devious ways and even with unlimited undos you might still struggle to figure out how to finish a lot of them.

As of the time of this review there are a lot of puzzles that show and teach you the breadth and depth of the game's mechanics and several randomly generated dungeons each with their own gimmick, including one that's endless. Plenty of fun to be had especially for the low price.

st33d says that an Android version may come in the future (Rust Bucket and Ending both have mobile versions) and I'm really excited for it as I think it's the perfect platform for such a pick up and play and put down any time kind of game like this. Even if it's not 'mindless' fun it's pretty relaxing to play while being very engaging.",1
29408,"This game is kinda like Sokoban crossed with a traditional roguelike, no block pushing though. Needs more exposure. I played the original Ending years ago on my phone, happy to have it on my Deck now.",1

29410,"Basically this is a VR port of the mobile game and you can tell. Before I bought this game I played the mobile verison which was free and its alright but of course for the price you can't complain about it. But this game is $25 bucks and there are so many limitations for the VR player that it gets boring very quickly. Whenever you have to do a task it teleports you to the location of the task even though you were just there and you are stuck there until you finish the task which just doesn't make sense for a VR game, plus there is barely any movement. I wanted it more like house flipper VR which wasn't that great also but at least i didn't get bored after doing one house. I don't know how much content is in this game but there is no way it will fit the price of this game. Honestly if this game was $10 to $15 bucks or around that range not only people would buy it, but it will be a better experience knowing you didn't spend $25 bucks for this game.",0

I am giving my honest opinion, my wife also loves the game she finds it fun. My honest opinion is the few bugs that are there need to be fixed once that is done it will be great maybe even get some expansion packs for it",1
29412,"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2 & 3[/h1]

You can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/KgruPpt0nv0

I would not pay full price for this game ($24.99 USD). However, in the current Steam Winter Sale at 60% off ($10 USD), this is an easy recommend for anyone looking for a chill, cozy game. This game is a VR port of a mobile game, so keep your expectations in check. If you're just looking for simple gameplay that is easy and relaxing, then this may be for you.

The game has a nice, linear progression. You start off in London and just renovate all the houses. Once you're done, you'll have enough money to unlock the next city (Dubai). Each house you renovate will have variations of mini-game like ""home restoration."" You'll have this game where you swing a blade around and it'll act like a lawnmower. Or you'll mortar the bricks together. Or you'll fix the hole in the wall by plastering it then coloring the wall with different tools available. You'll also add home furnishings to make either the cheapo house of your dreams or the luxury house of your dreams. The choices are limited, but it keeps the game feeling cozy throughout.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, but I did notice some frame rate drops / stutters at time, especially in the hub area. The only serious bug I encountered (I think) is that I couldn't change the colors of the bought decorations. You do have full locomotion, along with snap turning. I recommend turning off the blinder in settings. You can play comfortably seated.

I didn't think I would like this game at all, especially after the first few houses. But the more I played this game, the more I was enjoying it because the game introduced new things to do as you progressed. I hope that is the case for all the cities.

29413,"It is simply ASTONISHING how unfinished this addon is.

First let me say that the core bus is actually really nice.  That's what makes the decision to release it in this state so frustrating.  The sounds are nice, the gearboxes are improved over the poorly shifting usual versions from Kescrole, and are finally getting to feel like the transmissions on other addons.  (Kescrole just cannot do gearboxes and should have gone externally for help a long time ago).   Even what people in some reviews are describing are ""poor textures"" - are not poor textures - Kescrole have finally made the effort to make the dashboards, that are shared across all their products, look a little different from each other.    The bus depicted here is an older (2006-2011) version of the Evadys and the dashboard has been textured with lots of wear and tear; which I think has been done really well.

So what's the problem?

-- No tablet --

Every Kescrole payware addon so far has come with the tablet, to make setvar changes dynamically. This addon is the same premium price as his other buses, so why on Earth should we expect to have such a huge downgrade, by not having this tablet functionality??  I use his other addon buses a lot, and use the tablet in every single session, to customize the bus how I want it for each trip.  Not having this tablet makes this package around the same functionality level as the default OMSI buses.   Unacceptable

-- Function to change ticket machine language to anything except French, is BROKEN! --

In every other Kescrole addon, you can change the ticket machine language to German and English. In the case of this addon, it is stuck on French.  (This is the case with the machines that come with the Urbanway addon - it seems this collection of French developers all work together, and whoever created the ticket machine... well, it's broken!)

-- Only a GERMAN manual is provided. No English and no French --

No addon sold on Steam should be coming without a manual in English.  More surprising - considering this develop is French - is the lack of a French manual even!

-- External model animations are missing --

Again, every other Kescrole addon has opening engine hood, fuel and AdBlue caps.  This one has no external animations or features.

-- The ""Schoolbus"" sign on the front is disgusting (seems to have blood and gunshots on it), and BECAUSE THERE IS NO TABLET, cannot be removed --


This could have been a fantastic addon, but it feels like Kescrole was about 75% finished, then just gave up and released it in this terribly unfinished state.

I strongly recommend that you do not  buy this addon, until it receives a huge update, to bring it up to the same standard as Kescrole's other premium-priced, OMSI addons.",0
29414,"It is not that bad, overall it is a 7/10 for me, it's biggest con is that the add-on is missing all it's setvars so i had to fix it myself by messing with the cti repaint files. I hope that is not an abandoware and that Kescrole will update this model.

EDIT: In fact they included setvars (list) but only in a pdf file found in Addons folder.",1

You can spend gold to improve culture, industry, and loyalty. Each unit can be used on a turn to improve farms, mines, and castle walls. They can also be used to explore their current territory or scout other territories. There is a story, but I didn't experience any of it within the first hour of playing.

29420,"Alright I really wish I could just mark something as feedback and not an up and down. 

First off this is pretty much an alpha build. I get that the developer was just testing what he could do. That's fine and I didn't hate the 3 matches I played. But it's not ready for release yet.

Characters don't run, they just stand and glide, which is weird cause in the trailer they are running. When death occurs the rag doll physics get pretty wild and fly around the map for about thirty seconds. Some headshots don't count (though I enjoyed the Santa hats). I played maps Smog, Construction, and Simulation. All were the same map from what I could tell just with different names. I tried to play China Town but just instantly returned to menu, failure to load. 

Might be something fun to play with friends but as it stands now there are better free FPS games. 

All this said, I don't want to discourage the developer. Making a game on your own is not an easy task and this kind of shooter is probably something I would really enjoy once it's finished.",0

-sound
overall very poorly mixed, gun sfx are terrible, I tried the shotgun and it sounded like a suppressed weapon from 20 meters away, not to mention not 'gun-like' in any way

-Variety
little to no variety is avalible, 3 classes, 3 maps, 5 guns, none of which feel that much different from each other.

29444,"""The Detective Reaper Invites"" is a puzzle roguelike that challenges players to solve randomly generated murder cases. As a detective reaper, your task is to gather testimonies from suspects, deduce the culprit, and execute them.

The game is a unique blend of strategy and resource management. Cards can be used to acquire vital testimonies, but they come at a cost, so maintaining your finances is important. Money can be earned by successfully solving cases, and you can spend your earnings on items and cards at the shop, but beware of cursed items and detrimental cards.

The board game layout adds a layer of depth to the gameplay. Players must navigate through various tiles, such as Crime Scenes, Shops, Treasures, and Random Events, to progress. With three levels of difficulty ‚Äì Normal, Difficult, and Arduous ‚Äì the game will test your deduction skills to the limit.

Overall, this deduction game is ideal for players who enjoy logical puzzles and resource management. It draws inspiration from ""Mimic Logic"", that's available for less than half the price.

However, I hesitate to recommend this game in its current state, due to the barely legible font. It's a puzzle in itself to read the faint squiggly text. In particular, the letter 'Z' is almost identical to the letter 'X', which can lead you to identify the wrong culprit.

A big drawback is the absence of mouse support, limiting players to use either a keyboard or a game controller, which feels unusual for a puzzle game. 

Another concern is the balance of solving the cases.  Early levels can be guessed without the use of any cards and later puzzles lack the necessary clues or have suspects who refuse to provide any information. This combination forces the player to guess who the culprit is, potentially risking a significant loss to their health.

Finally, the game would benefit from an option to disable the time limit, as it's unclear why players are being rushed through puzzles in a genre that usually encourages thoughtful consideration. 

Addressing these issues would significantly improve the game's playability and make it easier to recommend.

29445,"Decent idea, pretty bad execution. UI feels clunky, ""map"" is too small and different room names overlap. Some testimonies are pointless and don't make sense. I'm guessing it might improve in the future, but I'm not really willing to wait. Sorry, refunded.",0
29446,"I was going to give this game a good review with happy smiles and good tips, but I'm mixed, now.

The game does not understand what constitutes a ""lie"" when it comes to locations, specifically when time is not a factor (only 01).

I've seen multiple culprits *honestly admit* their location in their opening message. I have to completely disregard location.

Play Gnosia if you want an interesting puzzler type game like this but with more elements of social deduction and argumentation.

If you still want to give this game a shot, here's how to break it: Max out on Culprit cards, SKIP everything else. The AI does not consider what has been said previously.

If there is 1 killer, and they accuse 2 people? Murderer. If there is 1 innocent, and they say 2 people are innocent? Murderers. The AI is incapable of throwing its ally under the bus. This applies to ANY uneven group, but it is harder to pull off.

Remember: if someone says someone else is innocent, they are always on a team with that person.

If someone says someone is guilty, they are always the opposite alignment.

The strategy is incredibly simple: Determine teams as fast as possible. When you're forced to kill someone, if you don't feel confident, kill the decisive testimony for grouping people up. If the result is unexpected, invert your qssumptions.

Once you determine the group that told you the truth, if you've grouped everyone up effectively, you win.

Remember that location, eyewitness, and all that other shit are next to useless unless the outcome is impossible. ""I was with E"", Z? But literally none of you were together. Murderer, spotted.

The only other useful eyewitness pairing was ""I was with (other person)"" with both corroborating each other.

The only time location/eyewitness work is when another person corroborates. You want to seek contradictions. Locations and eyewitness statements have way more variables than culprit choices. Make everyone declare culprits and see where it leads you.",0
29447,"A really great repayable murder mystery rogue-lite where you solve murder after murder with really nice graphics and feel, it is clear a lot of care went into the game.

The core murder mystery puzzles are like liar puzzles (similar to mimic logic) where the culprits lie & the innocent tell the truth and you must deduce the murderer from this. Each mystery has a very cool little map showing where people were at different times (although it doesn't tell you who is who). 
This map is great and unique, it is very cool to see the murder play out in motion, sometimes with the murderers lying in wait and victim entering the room, or sometimes following them in in a later part of the sequence.
The map is an integral part of the game which sets it apart, with layers people being in different locations at different times adding a lot of things for the characters to talk and lie about, and it causes some very great difficult logic puzzle with very satisfying solutions.

You can only get a few statements out of each character and you also have finite cards to ask questions with which really makes you think about which type of question to ask people. Should you ask F about the location they were in or who else they saw there? Playing these question cards also costs currency which pushes you to solve mysteries with as few questions as possible.

The roguelite part of the game plays out like slay the spire with as you cross a grid of mystery puzzles and random events and shops where you can buy new cards and modifiers which impact health and currency. At the end each level, there is a tougher mystery like a miniboss. A full successful run can take about an hour, but the game is infinitely repayable with different mysteries every time.

When you beat the game the first time [spoiler] you get to play as a 2nd detective character who limits the number of cards you play before you accuse someone, this really makes the decision making about which questions to ask much more important. [/spoiler]

Presentation is very nice and stylised, and gives a great feel to the game.


The negatives of the game are minor for me and may be ironed out in time;

The UI of witness statements can sometimes cover the map showing where people were during the crime.
The Z in the english translation has a cross through it making it look like an X which makes it hard to read the first time.
There are some 50/50 situations, particularly with [spoiler] the 2nd detective where you can sometimes only play 2 cards. The final puzzle of that run was a 50/50 ""he said she said"" situation which I lost & felt unsatisfying to lose an hour long run to chance. [/spoiler]


But overall, this game is a massive gem for me, some of the puzzles become very complex in a great way and are incredibly satisfying to solve and really scratch that murder mystery itch. So many murder mystery games are a one and done experience but I see myself playing this again and again.",1
29448,"Having heard about this game when it was first announced I was interested in checking it out as soon as it was released. Unfortunately the final product was nothing like the expectation I had in the lead up to release day.

Cases can go from immediately solvable due in part to the opening statements (X: D is the culprit, D: X is the culprit, Y: D and myself are not the culprits) to a coinflip because of pointless testimonies causing you to waste cards thinking you can get helpful information out of some uncooperative suspects. The penalty system for executing the wrong person is also weirdly unbalanced, as you can have a max HP value of 80 but a wrong answer does 75 damage. You can find or buy cards that raise your max HP and reduce penalty damage but it's all still random.

The cards you can pick up during a run either after successfully solving a case or purchasing in the shop don't offer much variety (you can have a choice between a 5-cost card that gets a testimony out of a suspect or a 3-cost card that does the same thing, or even another 5-cost card that has the same effect but with different artwork and name). At first you would think there would be plenty of cards that offer a wide range of useful effects based on the number of encyclopedia entries but they are mostly duplicates and some entries reserved for cards that impose a negative effect.

The UI during cases is also rough. Gathered testimonies would end up covering portions of the map that make it difficult to reference when making your deductions and in cases with a fifth suspect their portrait outright covers a chunk of the map. Narrower rooms that get generated in the middle of a map also make it hard to tell what room a suspect was in as their map marker overlaps the room borders and makes it seem like they were in an adjacent room.

Overall The Detective Reaper Invites has an interesting premise but fails to deliver in some key areas that make it hard to come back to for repeat playthroughs.",0
29449,"Mostly a bad game, but fixable, as it is not intentionally bad, and it already has the groundwork to being great.

The random setups are either too easy or a random guessing game, and the punishment for randomly guessing wrong is too hard.
All suspects will only give 3 replies, a VERY dumb limit, as they may even be a nonsensical space waster declaration, that is just adds to bad randomness.
At random times you have to guess, and this is usually an instant-lose-scenario.
The economy is WAY too hard+expensive+random, too often getting you into the random insta-kill scenario.

how to fix this:
- never have anyone make no statement from the start. that is a random resource  waster.
- never have anyone say ""i am innocent"", as this is a space waster.
- never have anyone say anything, that NEVER helps the case. (shocked, weather) 
- - alternative solution to the above, anyone who ever declares a space waster can be executed without penalty but then will no longer declare anything.
. . . maybe the fail-state itself is just silly. why is there no ""bad/greedy cop"" ending being played straight for what it is, this simply needs a secondary ""currency"" that is more or less a ""rating system with no failure or different fail states"".
- all declarations must be a logical-AND statement, we already have this, but too rarely, as ""A and B are innocent""
an AND statement makes the game harder while it also significantly more likely exposes a liar, and once exposed because all sides of the statements are a lie, this usually exposes 2 culprits at once. 
- more cards and cheaper cards.
- compared to similar deduction games, mostly mimic-chest-themed, you have the advantage of a timeline, but fail to utilize it properly (game economy is too constrained for no good reason)

The aftermath of a murder is ignored for no good reason, different weapons leave different traces, to be hidden/disposed only by murderers.
Add more token that potentially aid in exposing a liar, while they may also be a red-herring, played by a culprit.
Culprits have professions and outfits, that match their profession, but the murderer always lies who has what costume AND profession.
Some rooms have a security camera, that never lies, unless the murderer has a profession that can disable it.
Differences between murder weapons matter, some can be concealed easily, some make more noise, they all leave different traces on use and murderers make attempts at hiding traces/weapons after the murder.
A murderer will always use the murder weapon that matches its true profession, and not all murder weapons exist in all rooms, but may be transported between rooms.

""I was in the kitchen AND B is the Cook with a knife""
""I was not in the room when the security camera got destroyed AND A is a hunter""
A murderer may have to dispose of the murder weapon and remove traces of the murder, and that may add hints to who is lying.",1
29450,"Nice little game.
I hope the devs will continu to develop it and add cards and game mecanics.

I got to the end of the run but [spoiler] sadly, in chapter two, innocent started lying and culprit started to tell the truth and I hope it will get patched quick. [/spoiler]",1
29451,"I already played an hour worth of this game and genuinely, I'm conflicted by what I really feel about this game, but then I see the price tag and in all honesty?  It's a really neat execution.

The idea is simple, using simple deduction, using cards in your deck, you need to be able to sort out whodunnit in quick mysteries via testimonies, time, and location. At first, and in some cases, it's very obvious as killers lie and innocents are truthful, matching statements making it easier to detect, but then when you have 4-5 people and 2-3 killers, suddenly you have a bit more of a troublesome situation making you needing to pay close attention while on a time limit.

For $10, if you want a solid roguelike to experience?  Pick this up.  Slay the Spire is one of my all time fave games and, admittedly, Balatro didn't click with me (but I'm still playing it since it's still fun in the end) but this is cheap and pretty solid.  I'm very curious about Natalie's story as there's an underlying story to it all too.

So while it's not expansive (at this time), there's plenty of complexity to be had that makes this easy to get sucked into.",1
29452,"I hate being negative on a small indie game, this has clear passion behind it and a very good idea under its belt, but this is a very flawed game on a fundamental level. Even if all the weird jank and bugs was fixed in its entirety, the foundation this game builds upon isn't engaging for a roguelike, this isn't the kind of game you want to replay and see how things change between runs, the only big difference between runs is how much you get screwed over by random chance, sometimes you get a case where 2 people say ""X is the killer"" and it's a sweep, other times you get no testimony at all and when you ask questions, they give you ""I can't believe this"" or ""I'm Thirsty"". This is where the cards are supposed to come into play, but there will be times when you try to use them optimally and because the witnesses just choose to not be helpful, you get stuck with barely any more info than before. This wouldn't be too bad if you could more easily opt out of runs and start again, but there's no reset mid run aside from dying or closing the game, so if your up a creek without a paddle, you just have to wait until you die or reopen the game, it makes a already slow experience feel slower.

The concept here is really brilliant, a deckbuilder rougelike murder mystery is a idea that can be so fun, but this execution does not do the idea justice, If it gets more fixes and updates later, I hope it does go about fixing some of the issues the game has, but the issues are so deep rooted in its very foundation that I just can't imagine that happening.",0

In my opinion I prefer this kind of skill-based roguelike over ones where luck is the most important factor in winning. Combat is responsive and fast while still making attacks feel impactful. The just dodge and guard feel great, even if you wish the moveset was a bit larger so there were more ways to style on enemies.

Persistent elements so far are pretty basic; mostly just stat boosts and new super attacks, along with two unlockable characters. The game mentions new weapons but I'm unsure if that means there's a weapon switch mechanic or just a result of inaccurate translation. At $17 I think the game is a steal, but you have to know what you're getting into. It's an unorthodox blend of musou enemy fights and melee boss fights you might see in things like Nioh, and there might not be a lot to keep you playing if you want run variety above all else. Will update this review when I get farther, but so far I'm impressed.

Game holds 120FPS on medium with a 3070 and an i9-12900k so I'd say optimization is good too.",1
29455,"Truth be told I still enjoy the game even after the 2.0 update, however, I will admit that two changes from that version in comparison to 1.0 should be reverted.  Number one why, did you remove the multiple choice options from the shield parry,  the purpose of a combo based game like this is that the player has multiple options to approach an enemy.  Secondly, the making it so that only certain ground and air skills can only be slotted in a specific spot really kills the move variety, again going back to multiple options argument.  I will also admit that I kind of like the idea of the awakener skills from 1.0 and would kind of like to see those come back to make each class a bit more unique and increase the move pool a bit more.  Despite these gripes, I will still admit that this game is a pretty fun take on a DMC rougelike. The moves nicely combo into each other with smooth movement and the fights are pretty nicely balanced in terms of difficulty based upon player skill.  The runs are kept to a reasonable length and don't feel dragged out making the replayability much better than some other rougelike's I've played in the past.  I will say that if the two changes I mentioned earlier were to happen, then I think this game would reach an even greater point then it is at right now.  Keep it up devs, looking forward to what you have in the future.",1
29456,"New update feels like it removed a good amount of the fun systems, although it brought in new ones, the game feels worse off.",0
29457,"first of all ignore the playtime, accidentally left the game on pause when i did stuff and forgot about it a few times, actual play time is more along the lines of 10h

now that thats out of the way, the gameplay is fun enough but it gets very repetitive without much variation, you might say thats because going for the most effective option all the time will make things boring, and to that i say, theres really nothing else, elements are mostly just apply stacks with this relic, pop it with another relic, none of the relics really build into anything more than that, theres not like more complicated relics you need other prerequisites to get, which just makes every run feel the same to me, and other than that all you get is just stats, which just leads to doing the same combos

its not a bad game per se, just not what im looking for in these kinds of games(replayability with at least some variability), it was like $10 for me due to regional pricing so i guess its okay that i got 10hours out of it but wouldnt really recommend it, get it on a sale or something i guess",0
29458,"So at first I was a little conflicted. Not too sure if I should give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

But eventually I decided on giving it a thumbs up and here's why.

Is this game next gen? Is it epic? Is it awesome?

No.

It's average.

But the reason why I'm giving it a thumbs up is because technically it does what it sets out to do. Plus it's at a very reasonable price. Despite how good the game looks, or how well it plays, or how stable it is, it's still only charging 17 dollars.

Gotta give it credit for that.

But is it a must-have game? Nah.

It's okay. It's average. Let me put it to you this way, if you always wanted to play Dark Souls or Elden Ring but found them too hard, then I encourage you to try this game. It's like those but on super easy mode. I'm terrible at those games and almost cleared this one in one sitting. Which brings another possible problem. I think this game is only a few hours long. 

Again...making it not worth more than 17 dollars.

Overal it's not an awful game or an awful experience but it's nothing super awesome or must-have either. Basically if you like the look and style of games like this and you're bored one day, then sure maybe pick it up and play it. But if you're not sure, then just move on. K?

29459,"This game is fun, a good deal for $15.

The first run is pretty easy but I'm definitely getting my ass kicked more on the 2nd run as they add more enemy types and the mini-boss encounters get spicier.

29460,"Wow, this is actually incredible! Addicting action combat, super satisfying combos and sweet graphics. 3 Discinct Classes. Deep and fun Roguelike. BIG SURPRISE I massively underestimated this game. Just Easy Fun and an actually good game, system-wise aswell as mechanically. Animations also insane. The Rogue class is NUTS! Highly Recommended. Dont even wait for Sale. trust.",1
29461,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
The game is pretty bare-bones and lacks the complexity of it's bigger AAA action game brothers like the DMC or Bayonetta series' but it's a solid foundation especially for an indie game. Honestly, it feels a lot more like a Dynesty Warriors experience in its current state which is pretty good for its reasonable price point. Worth it in my eyes but if you're on the edge watch for updates and pick it up during a sale.

[h1] The Review [/h1]
If you've played any rouge-likes before the gameplay loop will be pretty familiar. Same bosses at the end of the tunnel but random room structure in between. However, instead of just being thrown from one random place to the next you have a choice between three room structures with different rewards or enemy types in between. Currently, there are 3 characters and it won't take very long at all to unlock them. 

Again, I should mention ahead of time that if you're expecting a lot of complexity in it you'll be pretty disappointed. I should also be upfront in saying that I'm not a combo god. Other people can surely elaborate further on this games lacking aspects than me so take this an an average players account. I came in looking for a Devil May Cry type experience but got more of a Dynasty Warriors feel. 

On the offence, every character is locked to 3 moves mainly. A launcher, (Which is also your helm-breaker type move in the air) a charging attack, (As in you run forward to close distance) and your standard hits (Usually a 4-6 hit combo). I'll give a brief summary of each character but all of them only have one weapon, only one of them have a gimmick without upgrades, none of them have ranged attacks (Which is really something they should add, would definitely help the game-feel a bit more), and the ""devil trigger""-esque (DT going forward) mechanic isn't character specific. (Meaning, while it is useful, all of them are simple enough that they're either kind of boring or don't mesh with some characters as well as others.) 

Every character in this game feels like you've just booted up a new savefile in DMC. Outside of being able to toggle sprint, a couple of pause combos, (I mean that, I've only found one or two for each character.) and a helm-breaker-esque combo ender, you have basically nothing and the few unlockable moves you can get aren't actually added to your characters moveset and instead are optional replacements for your launcher or charge moves. The only thing that can spice up this formula are the ""artifacts"" you can pick up during runs but again these are not character specific. This means they're plagued by the same issues as the games DT mechanic I mentioned earlier with the added downside that they're used constantly in your gameplay so feeling boring or not meshing with each character is far more impactful. Now we'll be moving on to:

[h1] The Characters [/h1]
[b] Knight [/b]: This game has a perfect parry system that seems to be geared towards the knight. I mentioned earlier that only one character has a gimmick and this isn't what I was talking about. There's a souls-style dodge roll and a parry which are introduced in the tutorial, where you're playing as the knight. It's pretty easy to perfect dodge and perfect parry and there's not much of a meaningful difference between the two outside of the flair. There are 4 options of attack out of the perfect parry as the knight and only one for dodging but the damage and stun is about the same. Now the reason I'm not calling this a gimmick is because I can't tell if I'm just bad or it's character-specific. I land parries pretty easy as the knight but I tried it as the other two a couple times and just didn't land it so I just went back to rolling. Outside of that there's not much to say here, his tools aren't much but it's a simple loop that's pretty satisfying. The TTK is fine but it's mainly his defensive aspects that make him fun, not because of the damage but because it just makes you feel pretty cool. 

[b] Assassin [/b]: Has the most to his combo game compared to the other two. Has a [Just] timing system kind of similar Assault Spy if you've played that game. Long story short, perfectly timing together attacks give a huge power boost and this can be made far better during your run. Definitely the character with the most to him if you're looking for complexity but still feels pretty hollow to me. If you're still really on the fence about getting this game you'll definitely get him within the first 20-ish minutes so honestly just playing it to try him out and just refunding it if you dont like the feel before the 2 hr mark would be my recommendation.

[b]Spear Woman [/b]: This is the easiest character in the game and the last one you unlock. You knock people up and can just kind of sit in the air forever. You still have to think fighting bosses since their hitboxes are wide enough you'll just be sent flat on your ass if you mess around. It's entertaining and her unlockable attacks keep her fun to play but probably the one that needs the most work between the three. You can infinitely pretty much infinitely loop the same two attacks to the point where the only thing stopping you from hitting the skybox is your foes HP.

[h1] Fin. [/h1]

It didn't really need its own category or anything since overall they're pretty serviceable obstacles but here's a brief bit about the-

[b] Enemies [/b]: Some of the enemies have kind of wonky animations that make the game feel harder than it really is. I've gotten used to it now but on an initial run it can definitely throw you off. This includes the bosses and mini-bosses. Since it's a rouge-like I'm alright with a little bit of trial and error here.

That about wraps my thoughts, sorry if it's a little unorganized but that about summarizes my view of this game. For a smaller indie project it's a worth the price I guess but it wouldn't hurt to either wait till more nuance is added to the gameplay or a sale if it doesn't sound worth it to you.",1
29462,"The indie scene is rife with choices when it comes to the Roguelite and Roguelike genres.  Be it on genre staples of 2.5D Metroidvanias like Rogue Legacy and Dead Cells to more outlandish entrees like The Binding of Isaac or Darkest Dungeon: you‚Äôll be hard pressed to go a month without another new one hitting your recommended store of choice.  So it‚Äôs that time of the month, and in front of me stands a Dark Souls-esque Roguelite promising fancy combos, plentiful enemies, and colossal bosses.  Alright, let's see what we got.

The Awakener: Forgotten Oath summons you to the world of Sylvalong, notably to the land of Lucatia, where disasters spread amongst the area and threaten life in and around it.  To keep the land from succumbing to the horrors that plague it, the Gods have pulled the world into another dimension known as Nothingness.  These Gods have tasked chosen warriors, deemed the Awakened, to eliminate the demons once and for all to save Sylvalong: no matter how many lives it takes for you to complete your task.

Forgotten Oath‚Äôs initial vibe feels like if you took Devil May Cry‚Äôs combat with Dark Souls aesthetic and Rogue Legacy‚Äôs rouge-lite systems and slapped it all together in a Unreal Engine For Dummies game-engine.  The biggest draw going into the story will be the combat, which easily stands as the best parts of the game.  You‚Äôll have your choice of three Awakeners, each clad with a specific moveset that caters to different playstyles: I‚Äôm a sword-and-board kind of guy so I went with the starting character.  Movesets start with a basic combo but can be extended using Launchers, Dashes, and Smashes.  These extra moves do exactly as intended, with the launchers popping enemies up for extra hits, Smashes adding a firm end to any combo, and Dashes which can be done on the ground or in the air being a flashy continuation against your enemies.

These movesets can be tinkered with before each run with different styles of attacks, but after trying all of them, I very quickly found the bread-and-butter combos and stuck to it.  While flashy, the combos will become notably repetitive: a recurring theme going forward.  You‚Äôll face enemies in a 30-floor gauntlet, with boss battles on every 10th floor.  Each room will only last you about 1-2 minutes depending on the difficulty of the area chosen after beating the previous room.  Rooms with harder enemies grant better results, which come in a variety of lootable options.

Your main power ups come through Relics, a 7 element card system that helps shape the style of your character during your current run.  Each element has a specific ability: fire does damage over time, wind will make enemies easier to crit, ice freezes enemies over time, and these cards will be your benefactor to being an absolute damage monster.  You can also grab Void Crystals and Soul Echoes, which allow you passive upgrades to your character to take to future runs and to unlock new moves and characters respectively.  Awakeners can collect coins which are good to buy current-run-only items and Relics to help aid in completing the build you want or to cash out for more crystals and echoes if you want to add more power to your next run.

Relics will work in a number of ways such as activating by doing a Launch/Smash/Dash, on a passive timer, during a dodge, or on Perfect Defense (parrying) and Just Dodges to name a few.  Relics of multiple elements can be stacked on the same action so later runs can have you activating multiple elements on one move and doing an abnormal amount of damage through one button press.  It gets bonkers keeping up with the amount of damage you can do and a simpleton like me does like doing a big move and seeing the big numbers.

But while the game expects you to run multiple times to gather knowledge of enemy patterns and to progress the overarching narrative, the stink of repetitiveness will inevitably work its way into your nostrils.  Forgotten Oath‚Äôs story arc requires you to traverse through the 30 floors multiple times (I needed 4 complete runs to finish) to collect story-related items, and in doing so shows you just how thin the content really is.  The fancy and enjoyable combat soon becomes a min-max study as later floors require you to find the best combo and abuse it to perfection.  While hitting an air smash on several enemies triggering several elements to do a waterfall of damage is enjoyable, you‚Äôll be doing it so many times it will become second nature and the allure wears out well before the credits roll.

Floors lack diversity and in some cases, explanations (why are there lasers shooting out of every angle in this castle???), and you will see the same room multiple times even though the rooms change aesthetics every 10 floors.  I think there are maybe 3-4 variants of each biome that you are asked to run 10 times a piece to power up your character and none of them are very memorable.  Since the game does not really provide you with a reason as to why you are in these specific areas, you are just meant to fill in the blanks as to why this asset-friendly arena is where you need to be and these enemies that are given no roots to the plot are necessary to be defeated.  The bosses are not much better.

Forgotten Oath has three bosses that, again, feel like placeholders within the created biomes but don‚Äôt really provide details as to why these enemies are our enemies.  The first boss, the Skull Knight, is the only boss given some plot context and that‚Äôs given on a few lines of text before and after your fight.  The movesets for each boss are pretty limited and are easy to handle and counter, leaving these fights longer due to a higher HP but not harder due to inherited difficulty.  Once you do get a completed run under your belt, returning for another run will only spawn additional higher-rank enemies to make the game more difficult, but in turn only increases the time of each run, which is not doing the game any favors.  You can add Curses to your runs to provide a boost in difficulty as well netting you more rewards for each run, but the amount of Void Crystals and Soul Echoes are collected at such a respectable level that these Curse runs feel provided for personal enjoyment rather than story necessity.

Lastly, the localization team for Forgotten Oath could‚Äôve used some more time polishing their work as there are multiple typos and grammatical errors strewn throughout the title.  Font choice looks like a preset default was used and doesn‚Äôt mesh well with the aesthetic of the game, giving the UI a very rushed looking finish and can cause some confusion when explaining Relics and navigating around the menus.  Using the term ‚ÄúUsually‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeemingly‚Äù when defining a card that does damage on a certain move is a very odd choice that makes me wonder if some of these cards were really working as intended if the text isn‚Äôt even quite sure of its intended powers.

What sullens the mood the most with Forgotten Oath is that it does not feel like there is a full game presented to its audience.  The combat system feels fleshed out to the point of working and then everything else is rushed around it to mirror the allure of a complete experience: the plot is non-existent, the locales are paint-by-number, and the enemy selection are cardboard to stop you from speedrunning the game by accident.  As much as the combat tries to mask the incompleteness of its surroundings, there‚Äôs very little redeeming qualities and even less to grip you to seeing The Awakener: Forgotten Oath to its end.

29463,"Very Well Creative Game, Rogue-like Type game. Fighting is smooth dodging is beautiful, perk lv ups and ability perks are very well understanding and detailed.  dungeon stage base progression , this game has tremendous potential honestly. Already beat the game doesn't take long to beat, enjoyable.  highly recommended if interested in trying something new. 10/10. still give a 10 even tho its single player only.",1
29464,"Surprised at how this can run on Deck. Graphics are great, gameplay can be a bit repetitive, but overall fun. Recommended for Hack N slash deckers!",1
29465,"I recommend this game BUT it really needs a lot of love when it comes to control mapping, immersion when it comes to dialogue, spelling etc. I understand English is not their first language I get it. 

But surely it's not hard to get someone who is a linguist (Or even just a English speaker that's a Grammar Nazi) Hell I would do it for very little.

Why? Because This game shines when it comes to combat I feel the amount of effort that has been put into hit detection and graphical effects. It needs voice acting, correction of errors such as spelling and other scenes I can't fill in this box of text.

I see the potential of this game, and Controls and spelling should not hinder such a game.",1
29466,"It's honestly a very mid game and I mostly bought it to satisfy my Bloodborne Chalice Dungeon craving I've had for years, but strangely enough this game's combat ended up being more like.. a Dynasty Warriors or ultra simple DMC game mixed with your standard roguelite. It's also pretty easy. I beat the full run and unlocked all characters within 2.5 hours of buying the game. The powerups are mostly just elemental buffs to your existing combos or percentage gains, but it still feels really good (and cool) once you get upgraded and have a million effects going off during your combos. I guess I'd recommend to anyone who's bored and wants this specific genre since it's not like we have any other options LOL. It won't hurt to wait for more updates/patches though

EDIT: New update was a step in the right direction but two steps back. Build diversity is more interesting and possible with the addition of a 2nd artifact slot (artifacts are your special attacks). They also added quite a few artifacts that I really like. They also removed your start loadout and just incorporated the abilities you could choose from as floor upgrades. I personally think that was a good idea, since previously you would just pick the best abilities and never really look back. Now i find myself experimenting or excited when I see the abilities I like. They merged the currencies which was also a good idea. I hated having an obscure currency purely for buying characters. They removed your ultimate ability and I find that to be a shame. I'd love a devil trigger or spartan rage mode. They also removed some of the cool counterattacks you could do with the Fighter class. Now it's just a regular counterattack when you parry rather than a few options. They also buffed enemy health by a LOT. Everything is a damage sponge, or it might just be a side effect of removing so many abilities/buffs from before... but enemies take a very long time to die and I often find myself air juggling them for waaaaay too long or even just backing off and waiting for my artifact to come off cooldown since it just didn't feel worth it to attack them normally. This results in the combat feeling slower/clunkier than it previously did and I don't really find myself wanting to do another run. That being said, I still recommend since the devs are actively listening to the community and updating the game. This game has huge potential if they can find the right balance.",1
29467,"The game is cool and I think that the updates are really helping, however I feel like there are certain abilities and upgrades that outperform the other ones that it creates a power gap. The amount of grinding you have to do for upgrades also feels a bit excessive.",1
29468,"This game has a solid foundation, a truly fun core gameplay loop. It is however lacking in build variety, the skill based combat will keep you somewhat interested but overall your choices are limited. I look forward to updates cause this could a be truly great game. Think Hades meets DMC.",1
29469,its pretty good. need more air combat tweaks... after 2.01 i thought you guy were cooking with the movelist and then you remove it? kinda breaks the entire loop of making combo strings ill be back when i can be a dragoon again.,1
29470,"Fun combat and great feel. Localization has some errors that make it difficult to understand what a skill does sometimes, but not enough to seriously affect the game.",1
29471,"Got to the credits in about 7 or 8 hours into the game. Not a whole lot of content, but it's worth the price (IMO). 

Something worth mentioning is that the balance feels quite off. What's weird is that a big damage increase comes from upgrading the damage from the main base, instead of getting buffs from a run (though many of them are strong too). Without the base damage upgrades, enemies can feel like a sponge, but after they're maxed, it's incredibly easy to stunlock and delete the bosses in less than a minute.",1
29472,"Solid gameplay, distinctive different characters, alright bosses, build and skill variety

31 Stages, endboss unlocked after first clear.

I don't even like roguelikes but the gameplay allows you to compensate for unlucky RNG.

For the price honestly a steal, just wish it would have bossrush mode, more bosses n characters. But hey for a 1.0 release at that price. Enjoyable.",1
29473,"I'm 20 minutes in, I know what to expect for any further playtime. I'm happy for the solid combat system I've so far experienced. Nothing feels clunky or forced, I can only expect more and varied systems to learn. I'm going to play as much as I can around my family needs. 

I get to game in either 10-15 minute blocks around my family, or I get a single day where I game til my eyes bleed. I've been happily amused for the 2x 10 minute blocks so far.",1
29474,"Some might see a fluted helm and immediately compare this to Dark Souls. Don't. If you must, this is a DMC-style combat in a rogue-lite form.

The characters' combat styles are varied enough to pick a favorite based on your preference. You have the tough, grounded heavy hitter, the sleak aerial-focused spear lady (VERY fun) and the really fast, lower damage but insane elemental stacker rogue-type combo-based guy.

In Monster Hunter terms:
Knight - SnS
Spear Maiden - IG (on crack)
Rogue - DBs

The combat has all the bells and whistles of a proper action game that wants you to improve and just nail down sections with fast reactions. You have a perfect block, perfect dodge, aerial combos and aerial dodge. 

It can be slow or fast depending on your character choice. They all gradually get faster and faster. The aerial chick really opens up a whole new way to play. Imagine you were playing a dragoon in FF, but like they do in the cutscenes XD or if Monster Hunter IG didn't have stamina. Healing's a slightly shorter DS3 estus.

The audio's acceptable, but not memorable by any means. Hopefully they revisit that portion.

Combat: 8/10
Graphics: 6/10
VFX: 7/10 - Gotta give it its section because they stand out in terms of effort VS the rest.
Audio: 5/10

Overall, it's definitely super worth 20$ and if they patch onto it, I'm in to try out the new content every time. For now, I'll be playing this for sure! It's quick, pick up and play, just go go go!",1
29475,"Very fun and flashy combat ! Not too difficult, lots of cool in-run effects to gather, and engaging meta-progression. 
On top of that, it looks good. The new wave of roguelites is here, in gorgeous 3D.",1

29477,"Feels like a mobile port or a Dark Souls Rip off....... 
Incredibly clunky animations, the parry/block is just plain...... awkward to look at and has a delay. 

The second game I have refunded in my life time....and the first one I have refunded this quickly. 

I normally put time in to games and give them a chance even if they are not polished, I finished Valkyrie Elysium despite it having pretty clunky combat. But this game just doesn't seem to have any redeeming features.",0

29479,Really fun Action Roguelike! Especially for the price. Looking forward to more from the developers!,1
29480,"I really really like this!
the combat is easy and fun i wish it had multiplayer and more classes.
the 3 classes u can play are really enjoyable my fav is the spear lady.
its a very simple rogue like by far my fav because the combat is so flashy. 
and for the people who have played EdgeOfTheAbyssAwaken this game is far better imo but i think it has less content but far more enjoyable i just hope the devs will actually update this one to bring some new classes or coop into it",1
29481,"Decent game. Just feels like more of a time waster due to how costly dying is. You have to start over from the beginning if you die before beating a boss, assuming their is a save point after each boss fight. 
First boss is easy if you mastered dodging and counter-attacking by then. I died after getting depleting his health by 50% but having to start over....I just don't have the patience for that. 
I have a job and responsibilities. 

It has the gameplay mechanics that I wish souls-borne games had.",1

29483,Very good combat and fun rogue like gameplay loop with lots to unlock and play around with!,1
29484,I don't know what the Oath was but it's clearly been Forgotten. Also i never woken anyone up so lack of Awakeners,1
29485,"I've been trying to beat this game on the steam deck for hours and when I get to the final boss, the game crashes every time. IDK how to fix it or this is dev issue",1
29486,An interesting take on a roguelike with a nice feeling combat system,1
29487,"Mkay, yeah, this game is definitely cool and worth the playthrough. The combat is obviously what was focused on the most and it still feels sorta bare-bones-ish at times like getting locked in certain animations or dealing with funny hitboxes from the bosses. It feels like an asset game where they fully fleshed out the combat. And the combat is REALLY fun, I don't want to understate that. Once I unlocked all the characters and found which one best suited me, the combat is extremely gratifying and can certainly scratch those power fantasy itches. I can't wait to see how this game improves over time. This is a special rogue, for sure.

UPDATE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The update more or less ruined the game. They took out all of the elemental skills you'd usually get and replaced them with two or three, it seems. There's not as many unlockables anymore. They added some artifacts, which was cool, but the original version did it so much better. By the end of the run, you don't feel like a powerhouse like you did in the original version. All around, just less fun.",1
29488,"VERY VERY fun rougelike. among one of my favs of the genre so far. a fast paced mix between dmc and dark souls meets hades.  from my play though, you got three characters to play as that all vary between styles. dual sword, sword and shield, and a spare holder. the game runs smooth even at 4k on my system. It is on the short end of the stick but unlike cod mw2023. the cost of the game is 1000% worth it.  you got combos and counter attacks that can be pulled off easily once mastered. The mixed score is BS. this is one of those games i bought and played the moment it was released that i can't put down. so maybe give it a shot and judge it for yourself! a solid thumbs up",1
29489,"Edit: I'd like to redo my review now that I've played it much longer. Overall I'm still rather positive towards the game and feel satisfied with my purchase. Just so you know, the game is very clearly low budget and seems to just reuse assets from the devs main game, The Awakener: Risen. This in itself isn't an issue but you will notice some lack luster amateurish animations and rough translations. 

Combat:
The game's combat feels really good; the controls feel responsive, you're able to cancel the early frames of your attacks into a dodge, and for one character into a guard, perfect dodges and guards feel extremely satisfying to pull off and to follow up with a counter attack, which will always stagger the boss and give you some free damage. The game really does reward skill and makes you feel excited for pulling off shit. 

However despite how good the game's combat feels, it can also just feel really repetitive. While you're able to free customize your move set and change it around with the random moves you can earn while doing a run, you do end up feeling like you're doing the same few combo's over and over. The artifacts are a nice way to add further diversity to your moveset but the fact all of the artifacts, including the buffs, can only be executed while on the ground feels very limiting. In addition to the artifacts, the level 4 attacks, all of your attacks have levels up to 4 that drop during runs, are really cool as they add elementally effects to that corresponding move. The issue is that you're not likely to get more than 1 or 2 of those moves during a complete run, in my experience, so you don't get to really get to enjoy them much before the run ends and due to the increased strength the games ends up pushing you to use those moves far more. 

I would really like to see some artifacts changed to be executable while airborne and for maybe elemental effects to be added a level sooner.

Enemies:
Basic enemies are far too basic and boring. Like straight up they lack a lot of complexity, they'll stand still a bit before throwing out an attack and most have one or two attacks at most. Their attacks a clearly telegraphed, which is good, and during an attack they're uninterruptible. All enemies can be launched and combo'd in the air and prior to being attack frames they're staggered by all attacks. Elites, mini-bosses, are a bit more interesting and have more complete movesets. They're still nothing really too interesting but they're fine. The bosses are about the same for me. There's a total of four bosses and of the four only Skull Knight fight 1 and fight 2 are the best the game offers, especially fight 2. The other two are just fine, Lava Golem is more enjoyable than the Orc boss to me.

I would like to see more enemy diversity in the game and for enemies to have more attacks they can do.

Sound: 
I'm not gonna lie the music is fucking mediocre. I think this is first game I've ever turned off the music to and played my own in the background. The sound effects are fine, nothing special. I don't have much else to say

Visuals: 
They're serviceable. Graphics are nothing impressive and the environmental design is uninteresting. The design of the playable characters I find really cool, enemies however are also just serviceable. 

Think that covers all of my thoughts about the game. It's a very mediocre game but for what it is and the price point I think it's worth the money. I got my time out of it and enjoy the games combat enough to keep playing. I hope the devs keep putting time and effort into and continues to work on this game.",1

29492,"Awakener: Forgotten Oath is a 3d rogue-like dungeon stormer. Calling it a diamond in the rough would be an overstatement, unfortunately. 
My play time is low, but I feel confident in my assessment enough to even forego formatting my text.

Currently, the game feels like a 0.5 Early Access release - though the game's 1.0 launch was just over a month ago. This game has a strong, solid foundation to build upon but it falls completely short. It's as if the developer's finally got through to the meat and decided they were full. Shortly after launching the game a vague tutorial message displays about changing your class. Then you notice the two other NPC's nearby, both adorning a warrior's gear set, and realize that's what it's referring to.
Unless one of them is just holding their sword for a friend, I wouldn't consider growing a chest and longer hair a class change. That's something else entirely.

The grammar and spelling in the game resembles something created by a pre-teen and didn't give the impression of it just being a language barrier issue, The game had a rocky development spiral and what should have been a grand, open-world souls-like adventure turned into a boring rogue-like that anyone who mains Garen could clear on their first try.

At best, I'd say this is a $5 moblie game, but most phones couldn't run it. On the lowest settings this put a heavy demand on my Lenovo Legion 5 pro, more than any game I've ever played. When my temps reached 90c, I turned it off and refunded the game.",0
29493,"New update made many systems that worked perfectly fine, worse when nobody asked for it. At current state I don't recommend. 
Also new update removed my old save game and I have to start from scratch if I want to beat the game again and unlock the other characters :).",0
29494,This game is enough to fulfill my hack and slash urges.,1
29495,"This game is pretty fun so far and for the price it's fantastic. One tip, not sure if it was mentioned in the tutorial and I skipped it or what, but your primary attack combo has at least two options. At least it does for the dual blade character, haven't tried it on the others yet but I noticed I did a weird backflip kick that I hadn't seen before and eventually found out it was from waiting to continue the combo after you see a white flash at the end of the animation for your first attack. Try messing around with different attack timings and throwing in your launch and dash attacks at different points in your combo, you may find some cool combos you didn't know you could do. If you like parries, the starting character is built for it. Every time you perfect block with the sword and shield guy you get 4 options for a counter attack and they're all pretty sick imo. I'm excited to see how this game evolves and hopefully we'll get some more characters down the line.",1
29496,"I think The Awakener has a cool aesthetic of something more like Dark Souls and combat mechanics like Black Desert with a good parry system for the most part it does have some flaws and some ways the developers could improve the game!

Main Nice Things ( Much more rushed as I started on the flaws and it was a little late )

1. The combo-ing your character can do is very very fun to as it can be awesome to make a build that heals and does massive damage at the same time but the flaw about this mechanic is that it can turn into a game of smashing one key over and over as with no upgrades I got to the end by just mashing Q but an idea that could help is more emphasis on some upgrades you've already implemented like doing an upward slash skills makes you do more damage but maybe you implement skills which proc new stuff after you do different skills instead of spamming Q.

2. The Gods within the skills are a cool mechanic when having multiple gods you can gain skills that proc chain attacks or benefit one another but something that can boost this is taking some influence from Hades and adding Duo God Skills or when having multiple Igni skills for example you gain an option to obtain a legendary skill in the card hands.

3. (Idea) This isn't a feature I see being utilized as much as it should be but the addition to card hands should be a rework to picking your abilities, like in a game called Deepwoken where when you get your abilities you can freeze or burn your cards allowing you to either get the same card next card roll - Freeze or banishing the card forever - Burn instead of implementing a reroll.

4. (Idea I thought of just to add some cool features) Variations to the heroes to play slightly differently and add more replayability but the idea is that you keep the move-sets but tweak the character where instead of the characters like Warrior being an all-around character, it could rely more on crits while being much weaker where when paired with elements like wind and no attunement you could do lots of damage.

Main Flaws & Advice

1. I think implementing invulnerability frames during a rag-doll from an attack could be good because of the way the combat flows, it's not a game where you are allowed to make a lot of mistakes and you aren't extremely tanky so when being rag-dolled the main problem is being chained into another attack, mainly seen when in boss fights, this might be skill issue but there were times when I get hit at 40 HP so about -20 HP but I get rag-dolled causing me to lose 40 HP instead.

2. This flaw is another problem mainly seen with bosses and elites that have follow-up attacks, when they do attacks and you're up close attacking them and they have one of these multi-hit attacks, the second hit is not as visible with camera not being able to capture the full hit without you having to look away for that short amount of time which would've been when you parried, which also can be easily fixed with two ideas off the top of my head being the implementation of either a quiet sound queue to indicate parrying while keeping your eyes on the enemy or the addition of follow-up attacks to be a bit more visible either a larger size/brighter parry indicator.

3. This one isn't a flaw but more of a nitpick but I think the addition of clicking to continue people talking and any parts of the game where you would need to press space.

4. (This isn't a flaw but the game is promising so I wanted to say this) With my past experiences with Rogue-Like games I think the ones most popular are not the ones with a few classes and the classic upgrade system being the main progression but ones where there is more depth to the game like quests and NPCs you can find, stuff that draws the player, for example, an alternative upgrade system which maybe upgrades the hub in a way where you could start with an item or two like in Dead Cells, or implementation of smaller game modes like boss rushes, my point is that the game has potential but all yall need is the hook for people to stay after beating this game because what you have right now isn't going to cut it.

5. Please add a bit more room variation as during the game it can end up feeling like you are playing the same run over and over again through the same rooms, not a lot to be said about this but more variety would be good!

Right now the game is cool but I would be iffy about recommending it to someone who isn't as avid about roguelikes as it is a bit barebones, the developers do seem keen on trying to make the game as good as they can so I think people should still support the game and see where the game ends up hopefully the game has a good run. Hopefully, some of this review is constructive to the developers and can help! :)",1

As for the 100+ maptiles, what a scam. You don't get any A1 animation tiles, a A3 with a SINGLE OBJECT on it,  and no A5, C, D or E tiles.   You couldn't create one decent map with the resources they give in this asset pack, and for $30, it's a no for me dawg.

29546,"Solid fun game, with some tricky platforming and fun exploration. Finding secrets, extra power ups was really the best part of the game for me and finding new pieces of lore. The combat might be the weakest link here, unfortunately some enemies only seemed to be able to attack me me once then they just stood there and we hugged each other, I think a few tweaks could make the combat solid. Personally I would have liked to see a bit faster Stamina regen allowing me to stay in combat constantly instead of having to go in and out of combat. And allowing me to roll behind enemies would also give the player more strategy during combat, but maybe this would be OP?

Personally I would have liked checkpoints, or going of the edge not killing you (pretty fun that it killed the enemies as well). But I can definitely see this being what people are looking for. More in the vane of jump king, where if you die you go back all the way to the beginning  and I respect that vision for the game. 

There seemed to be a lot of lore pieces that built up the world around you and then there we're others that in the same swoop also told a short story. Sometimes it was about the boss right before you faced them, or it was a thief stealing money.

In the end, the game i worth the money if you like difficult games with punishing platforming and fun exploration!

PS. super cute doggo dev art <3",1
29547,"This is the Flappy Bird of soulslike platformers.

It's a little rough around the edges. But the difficult platforming, unforgiving deaths, and unexpectedly immersive lore create a very addicting experience!",1
29548,"I quite like it and I see a lot of potential in this game. It is much appreciated how smooth it feels for how new it is. For I find that new, especially indie games seem to be very rough around the edges. There are two things that i feel would make the game a lot more convenient to play. One thing being the ability to hold on to the edge of cliffs and pull yourself up. The other being adding a save at the end of each boss fight. Other than that, keep up the good work Jubei!",1
29549,"I can't get past a boss, but the game is still really fun. I absolutely love the platforming. There's no checkpoints from what I can see which can be annoying from time to time. I'd recommend it if u have nothing else do like me and just want to mess around.",1
29550,"I found this game through posts on r/BisexualTeens and I was hooked immediately, it is a very cool concept, and I really liked the gameplay, however, when you die on Level 2, there aren't exactly checkpoints and you just start over, I am fine with this, as I can just get back, but it's still a tad bit annoying, I will play more later and update my review, though!",1
29551,"Its a cute and nice game, Its fun to figure out, although its a bit frustating at points. But all in all a nice game and an intresting challenge to firgure out :)",1
29552,"I would say the top review summed things up pretty well, but to reiterate:

This is a cool game. The things that stand out to me the most are the pixel art (really quite beautiful) and the soundtrack, and of course the fact that this was made by a single high school student! The platforming is decent, and so is the combat, although getting hit by enemies doesn't have much weight behind it, so its hard to tell if you've taken damage unless you're constantly looking at your health. I would say the combat is the weakest part of the design here. I would love to go more in-depth, but unfortunately this game did not run very well on my laptop, so I could not really play very much of it. But for just 99 cents, this is worth checking out!",1
29553,Pretty cool for a first game. If you're into Soulslikes and pixel art platformers give it a try.,1
29554,"[h1]I WAS SOOOO BORED[/h1]
I love searching games like Hidden Cats in Town and the Find All series, so I bought this game as soon as it was released. It looked bright and colorful and claimed to be geared toward animal lovers.
¬†
Those colorful graphics that caught my eye quickly lost their curb appeal because there were only a few different scenes that were repetitively used by cropping different sections of the same overall scene.¬†
¬†
You are tasked with finding 3-5 clipart objects, such as 5 Trumpets, 3 Unicorns, 3 Bulldogs, or 5 Blue Balloons. Some of the levels are covered with nothing but childish stickers like Unicorns and Rainbows.¬†¬†
¬†
As you find an object, you have to sit there and watch a giant hand circle the item with a giant piece of chalk before continuing your search while listening to canned laughter & clapping. You are rewarded with new Crayons, Markers, and Chalk to circle these objects on the next level...oh goodie!
¬†
I'm not sure who the targeted audience is here. Some of the scenes are crammed full of older adults at a concert or dog park, certainly not appealing to a younger audience. The next scene may be a collage of clipart dogs and bones or the before-mentioned Unicorn & Rainbow stickers, which are certainly not appealing to adults. Hmmm???
¬†
The most annoying feature in this game is constantly having to hear a ""Dong"" and seeing a giant Red X appear on the screen every time you hold the mouse to drag the scene around as you search for the items. You literally have to make a conscious decision as to where you place the mouse before clicking and dragging the scene around; otherwise, the game thinks you are making a wrong selection.
¬†
I made it through 16 levels before calling it quits, so it's not like I didn't hang around to give it a chance to improve. That says a lot because I am really OCD about completing games I started, especially when I haven't earned all my achievements...sorry devs, I think it needs to be more appealing to either adults or children; right now, I don't think either will be impressed.

29555,"I've played a large number of hidden object games (150+) and overall this one felt fairly average. Sometimes the objects were a little on the easy side, but others blended in quite well with the background and took a bit of hunting. 

A number of the scenes were repeated for a second level, but spaced out far enough it didn't really matter. The art style seemed to vary a lot between levels making it feel a bit disjointedness at times. And there was an annoying trumpet sound which would play at the end of each section despite the fact sound was disabled via the menu. 

It's certainly not the best hidden object game out there, and perhaps felt a bit overpriced. But if you are a fan of the genre and want to add it to your collection, it's perfectly fine.",1
29556,"This vehicle is marketed as the in-game equivalent of a License Plate Reader (LPR). In real life, an LPR reads license plates and will alert an officer if the vehicle comes back stolen, the owner has a warrant, the insurance/registration is invalid, etc. In game, however, all it does is alert you (after following a vehicle) if the driver didn't use a turn signal, has a loud engine, has tinted windows, ran a stop sign, etc. All of these are observable violations that you can see by UI pop-ups automatically or if you use the ""focus"" button in-game. There really is no reason to buy this DLC unless you hate holding down mouse-click to see a pop-up if a vehicle is committing a violation.

What I thought this DLC was, was a vehicle that would automatically see information about a vehicle/driver that you could only see if you opened the police computer AFTER focusing on a vehicle (open warrant, no valid insurance, expired ID, stolen vehicle, etc). There is literally no reason to spend money on this when you can use the focus UI and see this information unless you really hate all the extra effort that comes with holding down left-click and looking at a vehicle.",0
29557,A fun DLC. It adds a cool new car with new engine sounds and more options for vehicle related traffic enforcement. Overall I recommend this DLC if you have a few bucks and want a cool car.,1
29558,"This DLC is a must-have if you ask me. This car functions like the standard police car, but has a scanner on the roof. This scanner is extremely handy for scanning any violations of the car in front of you. I use this car as my main patrol car from now on, it is so good.",1
29559,"Would absolutely recommend this one, is my favorite car so far. The handling on it is pretty good, ELS package on it is nice, is quite quick and nimble, overall feels very good to drive. The observation scanner make it the best car to take out if you like driving around pulling people over.

Also helped a lot getting the ""Don't ever Drink and Drive"" achievement. If that's something you are still missing definitely consider picking this one up.",1
29560,"I expected this to scan for ALL violations including invalid ID, Open warrant, and stolen vehicle which was the reason I bought it so I didn't have to stop and then look at the computer. DO NOT buy this if this is also what you were expecting

29561,A really good purchase you can make! This vehicle is amazing for those who want to experience simulation gameplay but still have the helping hand of identifying vehicle issues. (obviously you tend to know how to pickup on most things by that time but it's still a very neat feature.),1
29562,"Its a cool vehicle DLC, the vehicle gives you notifications if a NPV committed a traffic violation. Its more of an extra vehicle and not an essential vehicle to carry out your duties as a police officer in PS:PO. I recommend this vehicle DLC.",1

29564,"This is my current favorite vehicle to use in game. I love that it can ping cars and mark them as:

Wanted
Expired Plates

29570,"Some people don't like the design and think it is ugly, I think the design is great. It drives and handles well and the info sign on the top is helpful if you need to stop traffic for an accident, the Do Not Pass is the main one I use to stop all traffic from driving on my side of the road while I'm out on foot at an accident, But keeping the flow of traffic in the other direction going.

29575,the game is very fun to play i hope to see multiplayer in the future also there was no gore in the play test but there was in the demo when i played it and it was really well done all around the game is good and just need some minor adjustments to be polished off,1
29576,"I like it, add gore add a mulitplayer and it could be great.",1
29577,"This game is proper good n' all i'm going to be real. But of course, aside from its good aspects I only made this just to note the cons of the game, hoping someone who works on the game sees this and takes this into mind.

Anyways, there are very few issues but these are major ones for me, I'll only state these in quick advance. The game is unneccessarily laggy on Carnage & Spoilance, I dunno why, I tried lowering the resolution, nothing helps. Another big issue for me, is when I die and i go back to the menu, the whole game freezes and breaks. I have no idea whats causing this, and I hope someone can bring this to attention. Apart from this, the games good and I recommend you play it.",1
29578,"bit of a learning curve but when you get past it this game is incredible. i cant wait for the full release and im really hoping there will be large scale battles with 100 men on each team. i think that would be epic. although i do think that the weapons in the demo work better than in the playtest, idk if you guys changed anything about it but it felt weird to me. still tho, great game.",1
29579,"Saying I'm impressed would be an understatement.

Half Sword's demo already has one of the best gore system I've ever seen in a video game. There are so many choppable pieces, if you slice a guy's stomach his intestines fall out, a scythe can slice a dude in half with one swoop. Your weapon might get stuck in some guy's body if it has a long sharp end. The AI reactivity is also insane, the enemies react to the strikes and blows they receive so realistically. You slice a guys throat and he holds the area as he slowly falls down, a guy missing an arm crawls on the ground using only one arm while scaredly looking back at you. 

The playtest version sadly doesn't have the gore and blood enabled because it's a test version for cons. The arena mode is a cool idea, but I have mixed feelings about the full plate armor. It's almost impossible to kill someone who has it on, the player included. If I have it on and I fall down, instead of dying I just get stuck as the enemy keeps on attacking me infinitely without being able to kill me. Trying to kill other enemies on the ground in plate armor is also impossible, I continue slashing or smashing them all over the place but nothing happens. There should be some big weak points in the armor, or it should get significantly nerfed overall.",1
29580,My main issue with this playtest as of now is it feels like the npcs were given much better control of themselves than the player making the game feel overall balanced against you. The demo felt a lot better when it game to player control.,0
29581,"Very Fun Historical Fencing game. The attention to the arms and armor are really good. As this game strives to be 1430-1480 Central Europe. This games combat is very good, some weapons kinda need some work but other than that I think it's fantastic. the voice, lines the music, The Ui Really makes this game feel unique to other medieval games as it has a really perfect art style for a game like this, furthermore The gore not being on the game does hold some things back but that doesn't really matter since its coming on the 0.4 update. [As they are showcasing it to the tokyo game show] Andd that's it. I love what you guys are doing and I hope the best. I will thoroughly look forward to your game.",1
29582,"Combat feels better than the demo, it is a great amount of fun. Switching between thrust mode and slash mode is really smooth, and overall the combat feels pretty good. 

Dying and returning to the main menu crashes my game which might be a 'me' issue, some characters in various tiers straight up crash the game. Returning to the main menu at all crashes the game, which means anytime I want to switch my loadout I have to restart the game. 

Overall, I am impressed with the development so far. I'm really excited to see how you guys keep developing the game and fleshing it out. Despite the bugs, the core gameplay is really fun and satisfying. I can already see myself sinking many hours into the game once it releases.",1
29583,"I LOVE THIS GAME

Dear, whoever made this game.
I love you and this game so much. I have been beating half-naked men for hours now with my long wooden rod. This game has really influenced me to grow out my wooden rod (in real life of course) and smack others with it later on. Thank you for this beautiful game, I would add some more blood physics and maybe even add multiplayer (1v1,2v2,3v3 etc.) cant wait for the full version to come out. In the meantime, I shall keep beating other half-naked men with my rod whilst I wait for the full version to come out.
Thank you.

29587,I have not played for long but this game is one of the funnest new games ive ever gotten. there are some bugs with grabing but I dont really do that much so not really a problem for me.,1
29588,Game is in version 0.3 and yet it's still one of the most ridiculously addictive and fun games I've ever played. The combat and physics are goofy but feel good to control and every hit is very rewarding. Really cannot wait for the full release.,1
29589,"A very charming, addictive, and entertaining game!
Overall, I definitely recommend trying the demo and applying for the playtest.

While there is not much content in the playtest, the physics based swordplay is fun, and you can see a lot of variety in the armor and weaponry that is already available. 
Although bugs are pretty frequent, the foundation they've laid out here is really, really good!

Mechanics wise; Halfswording is very OP, and stabbing is extremely difficult, seems to me anyway.
It could be that I'm just doing it wrong, but I'd love to see some kind of adjustments there, especially with the stabs (if the devs are reading lol)

29600,"Great game, one of the most innovative games I have ever played, graphics are great and fit perfectly with your surroundings, some things they need to fix is this clipping, sometimes if your fighting someone your sword will kind of clip through their armor, which kind of makes it unsatisfying, but other then that the game is great and never gets old for the most part, the difference from the playtest and the demo is insane, I thought the game would be just like the demo. But just knowing the idea that this game will have a story, and a working prestige system makes me want to buy it.",1

I would say it is one of my favorite games so far, the battles are realistic, the voice acting is on point, and its hard to get bored of. I cant wait to see what the game has in store",1
29602,"This shows a LOT of potential. Between the variety of weapons and armor, the mouse-controlled combat and the impressive body physics, this is teetering on the edge of a combat simulation compared to a game. I can't wait for the full release with the added blood and gore shown in the demo.",1
29603,"The demo was better and funner the playtest, you can't seem to hit anyone at all, idk i prefer the demo. Also playtest has a glitch where when you start a round it says you lost and asks you to play another round but you can't since you're still in it.
",0
29604,Absolutely love this. Takes some adjusting to the mouse controls but so much fun even when swinging wildly. Can't wait to see further progress!,1
29605,"Very great game so far! I would like to report that I have had two rounds so far where I lost on the same exact frame I loaded in, before an enemy had even started walking towards me. But that has been my only problem so far, keep up the great work!",1
29606,"The game is a perfect and fun mix of hard and easy, and I do know that it requires some more work, but everything about the game: the graphics, the cloth physics, the ragdoll physics, and every aspect is great.",1
29607,"Half sword is a medieval PVE game that covers just about everything you`d expect in a game like this. what i personaly like is the  physics because of how realistic it is sometimes.There are some minor bugs i would like to address,When you start a match i noticed in the first second of it when you load in your character is unable to move while the enemy can.Minor bug but still slightly annoying. Clipping, The game clips alot whether its the weapon bugging out in the enemy or just trying to pick it up it just starts flying around alot. i have also noticed that it sometimes lauches the enemy and maybe even the player( in the demo also). But this is still a fun game and adds a wacky feel to it. The graphics arent the best but still very good and its not what you might get out of most games for being so early in development. I love this game  i look forward into hopefully helping the creation of this game ( i have like 20 hours in the game rn)",1
29608,"Love the gameplay, and all of the preset classes. didn't notice any bugs or anything",1

29610,"Half Sword is GREAT so far! The game is essentially the next step towards full immersion in medieval fighting games, ahead of Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KDC). Combat took me about 5 minutes to adjust to, and even then it was a challenge. I appreciate the stamina system and simultaneous lack of health/energy indicators. I also love how some fights are over in seconds, and others can drag on for minutes. 
One thing the game lacks is clarification on how to stab, switch weapons, and get up. I think I figured these out after 15 minutes or so, but I'm not sure if I'm just leveraging the physics system to accomplish this or actually pressing the right command key. 
A scoring system would be pretty neat too, tracking streaks of wins (again, thinking of KCD's arena system). 
Overall, amazing demo. I'll keep playing until the full version comes out! Thank you, devs!!!",1
29611,"Really fun, and brutal. Even without the blood headshots with bludgeons and swords is extremely brutal. My favorite weapon is the Goedendag, which is just a gigantic stick with spikes at the end. But can snag onto an opponent and ensnare them with spikes as they struggle. I've gotten much better with other weapons, like the spear, sword, and blunt. I can't wait for this game to come out, can only imagine what work in progress sections are gonna be like.",1
29612,"This Game has so much potential,
Even though right now it lacks content but i still find joy ni this game after 13 hours.
its just probably the satisfying attack system where you have to swing your mouse to attack such a good conecept!
",1
29613,"this is the game from my dreams, this is exactly what I dreamed about. For me this is definitely the game of the year, I will be looking forward to the release
To the developers: I love you üíã",1
29614,"game is terrible for low end pc,s even though it is a very small game. i can play grounded, minecraft, and lethal company with way better frame rates and no lag at all. this game lags so much wouldnt recommend in its current state. i know it isnt even done yet tho so dont take my word for after development.",0
29615,"the controls seem daunting at first but its actually quite intuative once you get a feel for it and leads to some actual cool moments, the weapons are all very fun to use and especially blades when you manage to perfectly hit someone clad in armour in the neck or some other weak spot, its very satisfying, the only real issue i can think of is the stabbing motions arent always fast enough or dont actually point to centre screen so its very hard to pull them off successfully but when they do work it is effective",1
29616,Lots of flailing...feels like character has a mind of his own and my inputs are just suggestions sometimes.,1
29617,physic are amazing. bit of a learning curve to get decent at it but am enjoying the carnage mode. each weapon has its pros and cons and its just a case of figuring out what you like and just going for it.,1
29618,"This game is enjoyable even though it's difficult to learn at first. It is gratifying to get a kill. I am geeked as fuck right now. edit I played 14 more hours, I am more geeked now. This game is amazing.",1
29619,"A very good game with awesome physics definitely try it out its fun, especially when the final version released and we get gore too. Its so stupid its great. the physics are comical. Definitely recommend.",1
29620,"you can run full speed at a enemy while warring a full set of plate armor to act as a cannon ball 10/10 would turn there bones to dust again.

i think multiplayer with friends would be fun",1
29621,I just decided to try out the playtest today then i noticed a bug as whenever i try to play i just automatically lose and im stuck so i have to alt f4 my way out of the game,1
29622,"Kill thing fun, very few glitches for a playtest. There are still some, but very fun",1
29623,"good. physics, good but grabbing is still kinda goofy, fighting, beautiful, the stamina could still be tweaked a bit for the enemy's though, sometimes it feels like they just never tire out. overall, 1000/5 : would smash again",1
29624,Absolutely by far one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game. The fact this is just a playtest speaks volumes. I've recommended a game that hasn't even released to everyone I know. Keep up the amazing work.,1
29625,"I love it!!!
It's not finished yet and has a lot of bugs, but it's playable game for me. We can call it a student project. And for the work that went into it, it's worth at least try it <3",1
29626,"This game took clear inspiration from the Forest ish survival games. I had no idea what some of the items did or what they were used for. The controls are pretty whacky. No idea why they didn't just use controls from the games it was inspired by. Still for a free to play game it's not too bad. 

Gameplay Impressions: https://youtu.be/eiUVuZI5Dn8",1
29627,"Sometimes I find myself in the wrong place. Life can be long and grueling. You can strike yourself against the flint and hope to make fire, but it doesn't always work. 

Life can be funny like that. There's times I enjoy being myself and sometimes I feel like I'm in the wrong place. Like I've made a wrong landing. 

Self love is the most challenging game of survival.",1
29628,"It's not awful, I can clearly see the influence of the Forest and similar games. Its kind of wonky and confusing, and I managed to get trapped behind invisible walls a few times, But a free game with achievements is alright in my book.

And to make this so young is pretty impressive, its more than I could do even now. Its a good start, you gotta keep up the work!",1

29633,"A sweet, short and charming puzzle platformer game. Feels like a solid proof of concept for something larger. Was more fun than the visuals let on, some really satisfying obstacles to overcome, and left me wanting more - since the platform gun idea itself could lend itself to many interesting puzzle ideas.",1
29634,"cool game!! the puzzles are awesome, the background music is great :D love the simple mechanic of the platform gun",1
29635,"It's a neat little game with really cool mechanics. The graphics are terrible, sure, but the core mechanics are fun.",1
29636,"interesting. from the title, i was expecting a platformer, but this is more like a stealth 2d shooter. also, based on the cutscene at the beginning, i was expecting more of a story. the platform gun is almost really fun but the jankyness of the platforms definitely detracts from that. also i wish that the platforms sped up more slowly or at least had a lower max speed because it definitely goes too fast. i had to restart the game because i wanted the achievement for beating the boss under 45 seconds there is no way to restart the boss fight after you beat it. i wish the money system was more interesting, enemies drop pitiful amounts of money and the best way to get it is to reenter a room you've already beaten because the money respawns but the enemies dont. but you dont even need money because armor pickups also respawn. when i first saw a vending machine, it caught my interest, but they ended up being pretty boring. overall, the game could be better certainly.",1
29637,Good fun! Challenging puzzles with controls that are smooth and intuitive. Visually minimalist but captures the essence of a classic platformer while adding a unique twist with the Platform Gun utility/weapon hybrid,1
29638,"I found this after I was recommended the video about this game's launch failing. I really like the platform gun mechanic, and the atmosphere of the game is actually really cool and mysterious and reminds me of flash games i used to play as a kid and also reminds me of super metroid. The only thing I'd say I'd add is maybe the ability to crouch? I'm not completley finished with the game yet but I'm enjoying it so far.",1
29639,"This game really nails the atmosphere despite the amateur art. The platforming is fun and intuitive and you can move fast if you're skillful. I thought the one section with the big purple guys you can't kill was a bit repetitive but everything else was very good. I loved the end boss! Too bad its so short, I would have played a while longer. Cheers from AGDG",1
29640,"It's good, it's fun, it's challenging, it's unique, it's as short as it needs to be.

The developer tried some kind of hack to make the game stay fullscreen, by having it always be on top of other windows. But this breaks the fullscreen options. And alt tabbing doesn't work.

Since other reviewers mentioned it, the graphics aren't horrible, they're fine. It works. It's consistent. It's distinguishable. There's more care behind them than many games out there.",1
29641,"A fairly good concept that‚Äôs pretty well executed. The ride and speeding up bullets mechanic is used in a lot of different ways. There are a couple balance issues though, the health stations take needlessly long to recharge, the turrets kill you way too quick and the room with the acid floor is way too punishing. Overall, it's a fairly solid game.",1
29642,"The movement is really fun, it's a bit rough around the edges with the puzzles being more about remember a network of gates and batteries (timed buttons) rather than solving an actual puzzle and the mechanics and level design can be improved (you sometimes fall through platforms for seemingly no reason, very steep ones are especially buggy and some spot are really awkward where you need just a bit more than a full jump height of vertical movement) but the concept has a lot of potential and leaves you wanting more.",1
29643,"Pretty basic gameplay and visuals, but not bad
Very good intro and voice acting",1
29644,"Fun and well executed core loop! Short, sweet and clever.",1
29645,The neat premise with bullets as platforms. Using this gun you're solving platformer puzzles. Really pleasant and entertaining game.,1
29646,"Very neat concept, could definitely be expanded on.

PS: Currently following your Survivors clone guide on YT, having a lot of fun making it :)",1
29647,"Played this game on itch.io earlier and all progress I made was saved, which is kinda funny cause I started game without any weapon in the end of the game. Anyway, game's really cool, although visuals aren't that great gameplay is incredible. I am not a fan of platform games, but this one has really interesting game mechanics. I've never seen anything like this before. Looking forward for your further releases.",1
29648,Short platformer with a fun idea and good execution. Hope to see more!,1
29649,"better than it looks.

29650,"I'm stuck on the ""Requires Standard Permissions"" door. Also, it is impossible to Alt-Tab no matter if you're in exclusive fullscreen, fullscreen or windowed. Can someone tell me how to make it past that door?",1

29671,"It feels quite nice. It looks pretty good. I like how there are ""physical checkpoints"", by this i mean: on the harder jumps, well,  
when you miss them, you usually fall onto a platform just a bit below you, instead of falling to the bottom, and i think that  keeps the steaks up.

 Overall, it's pretty good. Worth checking out.",1
29672,"The game could use a little polish, and I would really like to see an options menu because my sensitivity was quite high and the frame rate being uncapped really started heating up my room. There are a few minor bugs here and there like being able to move the big block whilst swimming or ledge grabbing in places that you shouldn't be able to but nothing really game breaking. My biggest gripe with the game mechanically would be the fact that if you try to jump while mid air and you land it jumps again which led me to fall a few times when I'd panic spacebar spam. Overall though while I'm not the most amazing 3D platformer this game only took me about 40 minutes to beat and I really enjoy the retro style graphics. Considering the fact that it's free as well really makes this game worth at least trying if it sounds like something you're into.

It works out-of-box with Xbox One controllers, but I had a lot of problems with the camera when using a joystick to look around.

29712,"I was initially interested in this VN because of the gorgeous artwork, seemingly high production values, and the promise of a historical horror story based on a Japanese urban legend. I was especially interested since the artist from the popular Nekopara series, Sayori, woked on this project, and I thought it‚Äôd be fun to see her produce a story with themes more mature than ‚Äòcute catgirls want to go on cute dates with their master‚Äô.

Well, as another reviewer astutely pointed out, this visual novel is a very different beast from Nekopara, but I don't necessarily think that's a good thing‚Ä¶

Though this is a negative review, my first impressions of this VN were actually pretty favourable. The art, as you can tell from the screenshots, are gorgeous, the OST is very atmospheric, and the story does a good job grabbing your attention. The story moves at a pretty fast clip, and every scene felt streamlined.

The main meat (ha, ha) of this story is set on a relatively isolated Japanese island that‚Äôs ruled by seven important houses. The heads of these houses are involved in a power struggle, and several of the houses hope to usurp the others to gain more land and more money. We‚Äôre introduced to the heads of these houses and their relatives in a rapidfire way near the very start, which does a great job at setting the stage and building intrigue.

The real stars of this VN, however, are the main couple, Kurou and Kyouko. Kurou is a relative outsider, being raised as an inhuman killing machine by the mysterious mistress of the ostracised eighth house on the island, while Kyouko is a demure maiden from the ruling house who has been betrothed to Kurou.

Though their marriage is an arranged one, Kyouko falls for Kurou instantly. She spends the early portion of the story fawning over her hubby-to-be and trying to make him return her feelings: something Kurou is (initially) bemused about.

It's sweet watching Kyouko awkwardly flirting with Kurou until he eventually warms up to her. It's a classic case of opposites attract, and I liked seeing a male lead in a visual novel going through some actual character growth. A lot of male MCs in VNs are pretty bland and one-note, but Kurou actually has a personality (and a sprite... and a voice!), and he has a fun dynamic with Kyouko.

The writing does suffer a bit in the first half by being a bit too 'nukige-coded' (Kyouko is really insistent about making babies with Kurou, and some of her attempts to seduce him are over the top enough to be eyeroll-worthy), but this seemed like a pretty minor nitpick when I liked everything else well enough.

Then, the story jumpcuts to Kyouko and Kurou's wedding day, and the story collapses in on itself.

The rest of this review is pretty spoilery, so I'll hide it. The spoilers contain some discussion of dark topics like rape and abuse, so only check out the spoilers if you're alright with reading about such topics.

[spoiler]All of the development between Kyouko and Kurou, and all of the ominous build-up with the seven families, is thrown out of the window as the story takes a hard swerve into being a torture porn revenge fantasy, where Kyouko and Kurou work together to murder all the important men on the island, and rape and murder all of the important women after Kyouko was humiliated and abused by them on her wedding day.

Kyouko encourages Kurou to greater and greater heights of depravity, taking orgasmic glee in her partner violating every named female character he encounters. I thought Kyouko‚Äôs tendency to talk in nukige-isms was off-putting in the first half of the story, but in the latter half, she has long speeches where she tries to encourage her hubby to rape and murder literal children to avenge her. Kurou, meanwhile, is content enough to go along with Kyouko‚Äôs insane decisions because he‚Äôs decided he loves her: thus, the batshittery commences.

I tried to slog through the latter half of this story, since the initial set-up was interesting enough I wanted to see how it ended, but I had to dip out after getting to a particularly nasty scene where an abused housewife is repeatedly kicked and punched in the stomach by her husband (complete with a lovingly detailed illustration showcasing all of her bruises), until she's rescued by Kurou, who murders her husband‚Ä¶

And then proceeds to rape her, while Kyouko feeds her bits of little sister, who was also raped and murdered in an earlier scene. Inexplicably, the abused housewife gets off on cannibalising her little sister, which results in A+++ dialogue to the tune of, ‚ÄúOoh, I‚Äôm eating my little sister‚Äôs meat‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm eating my little sister‚Äôs meat while taking your man meat‚Ä¶ This is so hot, I‚Äôm so turned on, ooooooooooh‚Äù (insert hentai moaning noises here).

This would be Pretty Extreme as it is, but (as if THAT WASN‚ÄôT ENOUGH), the housewife‚Äôs adopted son and daughter are watching this Utter Insanity unfold ‚Äì and of course, the son gets aroused by this, then starts entertaining thoughts of raping his sister, because why not??? Who even knows. At this point, I started to feel like the writer was just throwing darts on a board with various messed up fetishes on it, in an attempt to come up with the most deranged sex scenes they could.

A lot of the supposedly 'dark' scenes in this VN are so out there I don't think they work as being properly horrific; they read as being unnecessarily edgy. The story might revel in dark content, but all feels gratuitious and porny, and the sex scenes slow the pacing down an agonising crawl where Nothing Happens for hours at a time. It's dire.

I feel like this review might encourage people to pick this VN up to see how off the rails it goes, but I can't recommend that you do that. A lot of the content in this visual novel is genuinely disgusting, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth paying for this game if you think it would upset you. I'm not particularly fond of guro myself, and if I'd realised what sort of story this was before buying it, I probably wouldn't have spent any money on it. I realise this will bias my opinion somewhat, as I'm predisposed to disliking this sort of content, but I've read some VNs which featured dark and gory scenes which still managed to have interesting stories and characters which made up for my discomfort. This story is so extreme, however, I doubt there'll be any salvaging it in my eyes, regardless of how it wraps up.[/spoiler]

TLDR; If you want to read about anime women being abused in increasingly ridiculous, nonsensical ways, maybe you‚Äôll like this, but be warned: you have to sit through about 6-8 hours of this VN masquerading as an interesting story before getting to your torture porn.",0
29713,"Final edit: Looking at the mixed reviews, it‚Äôs pretty obnoxious how people downvote an indie game just because it‚Äôs not their type of genre. Getting upset over the edgy or extreme content in a guro game is like being mad at the gratuitous violence in Elden Ring or Diablo. And if you think the story goes ""off the rails"" (like the current top review says), that just means you weren‚Äôt paying attention to the first half. You didn‚Äôt take it seriously when the characters showed their inhumane sides early on. This is a tale of very bad, broken people doing very bad things to other very bad, broken people, because life threw them curveballs. Don't expect a story about heroes here.

edit: Jesus, this is hardcore... definitely not for the faint of heart.

Nekopara‚Äôs sister company really dropped a banger with this one. This is what a horror visual novel should be. The story beats are incredibly satisfying, with twists and turns you won‚Äôt see coming. There are no choices, but there are ""routes"" and multiple heroines... just go in blind, and you‚Äôll get what I mean.

It delivers on the trailer. If the trailer grabs you, don‚Äôt hesitate to get this game, it‚Äôs worth full price. Make sure to get the Steam patch or buy the uncensored version elsewhere‚ÄîI can‚Äôt imagine playing a censored horror game (thanks for nothing, Steam). Ignore my playtime; I originally bought this from a different uncensored store. I only got it on Steam because I liked it so much that I wanted to support the developer and leave a positive review. My only complaint is the somewhat slow start; some of that could‚Äôve been trimmed. Strong recommend, 8/10.",1
29714,"The first few chapters are fine and leaves you with enough curiousity to wanna keep going but then sh*t hits the fan and pretty much turn into one big snuff film just for the sake of it.

If you're curious about the uncensored gorefest I suggest you simply look for the CG's online, because the game itself will take you forever to get to that point.",0
29715,"[h2]This turned out different than what I expected [/h2]

I did not know this was going to turn out to be an ""ero guro"". This is a first for me, I like edgy nitro+ titles but was never really interested in reading anything of that VN category, since i've had bad experience with gory films where most of it was pointless violence for the shit and giggles. At first the world building was quite interesting and you were feeling attached and potentially admiring some of the characters but all hell breaks loose about half way through and you lose emotional attachment to everyone, everyone is batshit crazy in this VN.

29718,"Do not buy this, seriously.
The story might seem interesting for the first third but then it goes completely off the rails for no real reason at all. Maybe you'll enjoy this if you have a twisted mind, a very twisted one.
If you've read Subahibi, think of it but worse. Way, way worse. And not even a good payoff at the end.
This story shits on women. They're nothing but torture material in this VN. I don't even know how sick you have to be in your mind to write a story like that and to illustrate those scenes.
I have seen some stuff in VNs but nothing, absolutely nothing, comes close to this. Absolutely disgusting.
Has the writer ever interacted with a woman? I have never seen such bad writing in my entire life. I really wanted to like this VN because the story started off interesting, but I suggest you to not fall for it. Save yourself some sanity and read some other VN instead.",0
29719,"You've heard all about the gory details. Granted, that's the majority of the game that others have already talked about, but there are also more aspects to it. When not showing scenarios of spine-crushing and disembowelment, [i]Nie no Hakoniwa[/i] details a story centered on politics, corruption, depravity, and the primal descent into dark instincts. Each character is a caricature with insanity levels dialed by 999x. When progressing through the story, you might be able to point out qualities of characters that exist in reality.

The character and art style is exquisite and the sound design is immersive. The BGM is based on traditional Japanese music which evokes a sense of tranquility in peaceful moments and an atmosphere of foreboding during tense moments. All of the voice acting is *chef's kiss*, with special acknowledgment to the protagonist's seiyuu, Yotsuba You, for his outstanding performance. 

The world of Nie no Hakoniwa is set in a time period wherein women were marginalized, a theme present in 95% of the plot. It's a realm of political intrigue, where leaders are consistently racing to have the upper hand. The treatment of women during this era is disheartening. The young Kyouko's monologue, in particular, resonates deeply, illustrating her dehumanization within her own family.

Character development may seem minimal, with characters exhibiting linear growth, but their established personalities and conversations are really what make them bounce off each other to propel the story forward. The characters' backstories just make their personalities make sense. Others make you cry and feel for them while others display such vile behaviour that you just want them to disappear. Others will leave you scratching your head in confusion while others will make you nod in contemplation.

Regarding replay value, unless you're keen on uncovering missed hints or analyzing subtle details, the game may not offer much incentive for multiple playthroughs. If you're a big fan of psychoanalyzing almost anything, then you're in for a treat.

This game is first and foremost a horror visual novel, exploring a myriad of body horror elements. Mutilation, cannibalism... It's not for the faint of heart, so caution is advised. However, I will say, it's not the worst thing you can see. There are a whole lot of other VNs that show worse things. The violent and gory scenes from a horror perspective are only there to provide shock factor. Compared to other VN titles, I consider Nie no Hakoniwa as one of the weakest or tamest in the genre. 
If you are looking for the ""other type"" of content, then I'd like to caution you that there is only a small portion of wholesome vanilla scenes and those pretty much only involve the protagonist's wife, Kyouko-- who is the best girl. 

The best part of this visual novel for me (and why I played through this visual novel in the first place) is the relationship between Yasaka Kurou and Shiki Kyouko. They seemingly mesh well with each other and complement each other. They both hold extreme devotion to each other and only each other. Despite being incomplete beings, together, they are one unit. In insanity and brokenness. 

But what made Nie no Hakoniwa - Nie no Hakoniwa, is the tragedy and realization that no matter what type of love you act on, sometimes the consequences and actions you do aren't always in your love's best interests.

In summary, Nie no Hakoniwa delves into the deep ugly facets of human nature as well as displays that even the most beautiful of emotions, ""Love"", can turn into something that creates and yet deforms society and the self.",1
29720,"First of all - Go buy the patch first because there's lot of important stuff that you will be missed if you didnt patch the r18 patch. ( i play  8 hours without patch first time- and i realized some section just seems like skipping so much- some part just not make sense- so you must patch it for better experience to fully know what's going on). also warning this is Gore- graphic game.

I must say the overall is a good read, i love how chill at first getting to know every character and then after prolog it started- the game did really good with how the storytelling,  as i read more and more it started interesting and more more mystery build up, it just like what our normality has been- sudden bend the reality, there are no more normal- it build up until the end ( love the twist and the ending )

The Art is amazing high quality detailed work spite also Hscene too. 
BGM n SFX really get me goosebumps.

29723,"After finishing Nie no Hakoniwa I'm genuinely torn about the game if it's something I would recommend or not. It had a lot of frustrating moments, occasional typo, and the after scene left a bad taste in my mouth. (Oh and please let us have an update to turn off separately the sex sounds? The effect sounds for the h scenes were one of the worst I've heard.)
On the other hand, the music, the voice acting, the art is beautiful and the story while it's nothing new it is interesting. The final reveal while I should have expected it considering all, caught me off guard. My actual read time was 23 hours and 12 minutes.",1
29724,"Okay, I'm having a hard time collecting my thoughts. I haven't finished the game yet, I don't even know where I am at, but the game has started to become what it should be.

First of all, I'm playing with the DLC and no matter how it sounds, I recommend playing with it, despite the shocking erotic scenes. After all, it's eroguro. I would compare playing with DLC to playing Saya no Uta with 18+ patch too, where erotic scenes play some ""important role"" in the overall plot, even if they seem unnecessary.

At first I was a bit bored. Kyouko (whom I only started liking after [spoiler] her ""death"" [although she's still a bit annoying] [/spoiler] ) was incredibly irritating, but Nozomi pissed me off even more...

No matter how you look at it, this game is a guro game, so obviously """"a bit"""" grotesque, but I think that if someone has done minimal research, they won't be traumatized by the gameplay. It's not an extremely shocking game, but it may shock people who bought it just because it has nice graphics.

The game (with DLC) contains scenes of grape and murder etc. I think that a large part of the audience are just perverts who want to relieve themselves with a game that includes murder and erotic scenes at the same time........, but everytime I play it I'm trying to take my mind off it and look at the game a bit more psychologically. After all, games of this type are supposed to outrage and disgust us, right? If anyone is new to this genre - this game nails it! For people who have played similar games before, it may seem just... Kinda edgy. Because you know, for example [spoiler] woman spasms with pleasure when a guy crushes her lungs...?  [/spoiler] Like get some help. Nevertheless, history is worth such excesses. I guess...

I can't give a full rating yet because I haven't finished the game and I still have some left, but to sum up - it's not a game for everyone of course, although it is interesting game. It has a lot of boring moments, but when [spoiler] Kurou returns to Kyouko [/spoiler] game finally starts to be dynamic and more shocking. 

It cannot be ignored that it is mainly based on violence against women, so if you are a woman - it may shock you even more, which is at the same time a huge advantage of the game (because after all, games of this type are supposed to do that...), but also a disadvantage (because it is simply sad and distasteful). Sometimes I felt really bad (as a woman) because of the way the story described how women want to be humiliated... I wouldn't call it a horror though, it's just gore meant to disgust us. And excite sick people. That's it.",1
29725,"After finishing this game I have a lot of thoughts running trough my mind. 
First I need to say I sticked to the sfw-Version of Steam without purchasing the 18+ DLC, but I was aware of the Rape contend the DLC contains. On that note I just want to say this game would have been great if it had been a sole gory revenge plot. I don't regret sticking to the sfw version even if you need to pay attention and read a lot between the lines, or else there are major story holes. I wished they would have edited the sfw Version at least so that you get a gruesome death scene as an alternative to the ""original"" scenes that are cutted. 
So...you may ask yourself why I don't give it a negative review then. Simple.
Despite all that, the Artwork is gorgeous and was what drew my attention in the first place. The voiceacting is pretty great as well - even if everyone is kinda allready beyond saving on that Island. 
Overall the Game has a lot of interesting points that keept my Interest on a high level, it didn't get boring as the story progressed. 
Here is a big ""but"" - there is a lot of sensible content even in the sfw Version, such as canibalism, violation, abuse, human trafficking, gore and so on. So if you are triggered by/ or sensible to some Themes please look up the CW for this game. 

If you want my honest opinion? Stick to the sfw Version instead of the nsfw one, that only gives you a major Ick (and ruins the characters)",1
29726,"You've probably read this review a few times.

Great story that devolves in to straight up torture porn that completely defeats and destroys any meaningful buildup from the first half of the story.. Any care or empathy you felt towards any character, even the main protagonist just disappears, I couldn't finish it, the main character just devolves in to a one dimensional being despite having some nice development to get you interested in to the first half.

Don't buy it, it's not worth the money.",0

Genuinely this game is incredible if you can handle the content. 1 thing tho there's a really bad bug with this that will wipe your gallery after finishing the game if you restart. apart from that tho 9/10",1
29728,"While going in i knew this was not going to flowers and sunshines i can def say i did not expect the story to take this turn....

29730,"From the sister brand of NEKO WORKs, creator of Nekopara, comes a VN masterpiece by Sayori that leaves all the innocence of her previous works at the front door. 

The supernatural aspect, while being the main driving force for the events of the game, takes a backseat to a Romance/Revenge story ultimately about how far one will go to bring happiness and peace of mind to their loved ones after their sense of worth has been stolen from them, and how desperate others are to intervene in those attempts purely for their own satisfaction.

""Oh yes, there will be blood."" I would highly recommend you stay away from this title if you can not deal with themes of Blood/Gore, Sexual Assault/Rape, and other intense themes.",1
29731,"This game is incredibly based, especially towards the female characters. I laughed hard at a lot of the remarks some of the characters were making, they do not pull punches based on what was the social norm back then in Japan. The game itself will gate-keep the tourists fortunately.

My only minor complaint is that the game's dialogue leans toward Nukige quality at times, I was expecting more in the writing. The heroines so far are constantly horny as soon as they're introduced to the point of being a bit annoying. For example, the love interest in the first part will tell the MC that she wants to get preggo, usually in detail.

Overall, solid game you will enjoy if you like horror/gore.

Edit:
I have now finished the story, and I believe the mystery reveal was well executed. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, despite my minor gripe of the dialogue being repetitive some of the time.",1
29732,This VN is as messed up as it is entertaining. The art is super high quality too.,1
29733," interactivity? I wanted to like this ...but most VN's have some kind of  interactivity even if they seem less and less these days. I ""played"" this until you meet two main characters and was whole heartily bored as hell. ... This should just be labeled a book lol. I dont know but for 30 bucks this is just paying for a book not a game. very boring.",0
29734,"Quite an elaborate take on retelling the popular Japanese Urban Legends 'Kotoribako'

This one is not for the faint of heart. 
It seemingly introduced us to a political/ rural governance power struggles with a slice of true love romance plots at first but when the real plot pick ups, the VN reveals itself to the faithfulness of the original urban legend story.",1
29735,"What an atrociously bad visual novel. At least, at the beginning, I felt lukewarm about the story‚Äîit could possibly go somewhere interesting, but moment-to-moment, I wasn't engaged. However, Nie no Hakoniwa only got worse with each hour I invested into it. For nearly the whole runtime, I was wondering when it would finally become interesting, only for it to never do that. Even worse, it ended up going down one of the most nonsensical routes it could have taken from its setup.

The novel ostensibly tries to present a story in which all the characters are morally grey. ""Sure, the protagonist isn't the best person, but his enemies are bad, too, so I want to root for him,"" the scenario director seems to want you to think. However, what Nie no Hakoniwa actually does is fail at telling a morally grey story. Rather, it's closer to morally black: every character is such a horrible person that I don't care to root for either the protagonist or the antagonists. In fact, I ended up not really caring what happened at all. The ending seems to present the protagonist and main heroine in a sympathetic light‚Äîthe tone of the writing wants you to feel bad for what happens to them‚Äîbut they were so irredeemably disgusting for the majority of the story that this presentation seems completely unjustified.

Additionally, the protagonist is supposed to be this ripped, badass assassin who can kill anyone without making a sound, but in reality he comes across as weak-willed because he simply goes along with whatever the main heroine wants. And it's a miracle he falls in love with her (although he himself is not even sure that he is because, again, he's supposed to be an emotionless badass), because from the first second she shows up, she comes off as incredibly irritating, incessantly begging the protagonist to get her pregnant.

At the very least, Nie no Hakoniwa does have some themes about how, under a patriarchy, the only value women are thought to have is as childrearers, but those themes are so infrequently explored and so painfully unrealized that it in no way is worth trudging through the slop that is the remaining 99.9% of the story to get to them. Nie no Hakoniwa is, at this point in time, the worst visual novel I have ever read.

2/10",0
29736,"BEFORE you purchase Nie No Hakoniwa you need to know that there is gore, necrophilia & cannibalism involved. If you want to purchase the NSFW DLC content you'll need to pay an extra 10$ on DL-Site. Nie No Hakoniwa is a story centered around the mysterious yet horrifying Kotoribako. Yasaka Kurou is a stoic assassin of the sorts who is to be wedded to the beautiful yet eccentric Kyouko Shiki. You'll go through a roller coaster of emotions as you progress deeper into the story.

Art, sound, music, interface and everything feel polished, as does the translation. 
I'm a slow reader so i'm looking forward to how it pans out, but so far I recommend.

Only negative is the uncensor patch is paid,  I recommend getting it on dlsite as it's cheaper then denpasoft with the perpetual 15% off coupon

Bonus points for full steam deck compat, even the op works",1
29738,"Overall a good game, setting aside some of the more extreme content when you strip it down to just the story element it was interesting and unique. The art is pretty with large cast of very different and interesting characters. And the game is a fully voice acted as well which is always a plus when the voice acting is good. With the story being far from boring I wish there was less nswf scenes honestly and it felt like some of those scenes went on longer than they should have. That being my only complaint however. It is well written for the obvious target they were going for and yes smut with plot but still unique and keeps your attention. But lots of trigger warnings so this game is def not for the faint of heart if your thinking of getting it.",1

Solid and clever scares.",1
29759,"Fun concept and great atmospheric horror, but at the moment too difficult imo. It's a bit like playing a spot the difference game, but you have to remember how everything looked - which is especially difficult when first starting. The more you play, the better you get at spotting things, but my first few playthroughs were very frustrating when I couldn't see anything amiss at all. Since there doesn't appear to be a limit on reporting, my best bet tended to be reporting randomly whenever I'd gone too long without an anomaly. 

I think all of that could be fixed with a tutorial or 'easy' level, where you can see the type of anomaly you mean. Or, maybe you could increase difficulty by increasing the types of anomaly for each map (as in, the house would have 6 things you could report, hotel could have 8, factory 10) to build the player up slowly to learn what to look out for. 

But despite getting a bit frustrated, I really enjoyed playing. Wonderfully spooky and made me incredibly paranoid!",1

29794,"I have a bit of a Backrooms addiction, and this is the 28th Backrooms game that I've purchased. I am stunned at how solid it is for the price it is being sold for!

There was a game-breaking glitch the very first time that I played (I picked up the key, explored the house, and when I went to leave, the key was no longer in my inventory, so I was trapped in the initial room. I rebooted the game, and it has been fine since). There is also some issues with color blending at the edges of the screen, and one entity that cannot attack you if you're crouching, but those and the initial glitch are the only issues that I've had. One hasn't resurfaced, one is very minor, and the other should be an easy fix.

The controls are smooth (No head-bob. Thank you!), the scenery gorgeous, the maps are challenging, and there is plenty to explore (and to run from). There is a solid 'save' system (as a busy gamer, I thank you for that), and you can choose your levels. That can be a plus or minus, depending on if you feel that progression needs to be earned. I, however, really enjoy that option and see it as a definite plus!

The story is a bit weak, and I am not awed by the soundtrack, but that is getting pretty darn nit-picky about a game for under $1.

This would have been worth it for $4.99, so I can only say that if you are a Backrooms fan, this one is a must-own for the collection!",1
29795,"Wow guys, not bad at all! Sure, the game is very short, and several models are not placed very well in the environment, BUT, speaking of pure gameplay, this game is indeed very fun and entertaining, with plenty of different entities and puzzles that will keep you engaged till the very end. Every new level is a surprise, you won't see any recycled mechanics here. For its price, this game is even too good in my opinion, I expected MUCH less. If you are interested in the backrooms universe, try this without second thought, I don't think you will be disappointed!
Cheers guys!",1
29796,"This is a decent game if you have 1‚Ç¨ and 1 hour to spare. It could be a bit refreshing because it isn't bad like most backrooms games, but there really isn't something interesting or unique that this game has to offer. You won't miss much if you skip it.

The rating that I can give to this game is 6/10.",1
29797,"I've only played for a few hours, but this game definitely seems worth the price. It has an intriguing storyline that I plan to see through to the end. If you're curious about the gameplay, I've included some below! üòé

29799,"Not too bad for under a buck. This is one of the 2 better Backrooms games I've played on Steam thus far..The Complex: Expedition is the best imo. Solid effort here from Wombat Games.

29800,"I found this game pretty dull and easy. Maybe I didn't play long enough for it to get good, but it felt like it was made for little kids. It has a creepy atmosphere but the gameplay and the graphics are only alright. There isn't much to it, it feels more like an attempt to cash in on the Backrooms trend. Maybe good for younger audience, not for me.",0
29801,"I enjoyed it.  Well done atmosphere/ambience and very good balance of difficulty and opportunity to explore among moments where you have to run.  The price is a no-brainer for a few hours entertainment.  I think it's a bit under-priced, really.  I enjoyed the pool level the most.  Serene.",1
29802,"Horrible backrooms game. monster is absolutely worst part in this game. 
it is faster then you, it kills you in 1 hit. You have limited stamina, you cant un-run him. 
Only thing why i refund the game.",0
29803,"Terrible. No puzzles or difficulty to it at all. Just run from the occasional entity (which have terrible sound samples, by the way), find a key, find a door, and run. That's it. Nothing fun about it at all. Paying the $0.50 for it 50% off on sale was even too much for this.",0
29804,"The game is good, especially for the price it is. The only problem is that when crouched the entity can't kill you. Other than that, it's pretty good!",1
29805,"This is fairly good for $0.75. These games are usually pretty off-putting, but this one isn't bad. It's straightforward and doesn't lie about what it is, it just gets down to the knitty gritty and doesn't try to mislead.",1
29806,this game was pretty fun. I streamed it and beat it. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something to do for an afternoon,1
29807,Awesome game till you get to the last level witch feels impossible to beat. you have to run and dodge the monsters and if you miss step i half second you loose. NO THANKS after 35 attempts I was so frustrated i uninstalled it. I dead 4 times throw out the enter game but dead 35 time on the last level... yeah not balanced at all.,0
29808,It's alright but it's not great kids the kid busy for like 5 mins. You can't run that fast and you can't run for long you always die in one hit even tho you give a way to heal. If you fixed how long you can run and how fast changed the mobs damage it could be better. I'm not the one playing it but the 2 mins I did try it was just bad for an adult.,0
29809,"Well i was having fun til the run level, you cant gain any gap on the creature and even if you go full speed ahead and dodge everything in the way he can still just catch you sometimes, thumbs down til thats addressed, otherwise id say it was fun til that point.",0

29834,"For the little bit I played I honestly just found the game a mixture of confusing and unplayable. 

To start with the menu does not convey information that well as to how you even start the game. Then getting into the game itself it just comes across as confusing to figure out how you're moving around the map. What made me in the end stop playing is encountering some odd glitches where the camera got locked in place to not follow you anymore. This glitch would persist between reloading a save.

All said I can't recommend it. I wish I could because I do like the concept of a Metroidvania set in a Supermarket, but this game is not it.",0
29835,"I played this ""Game"" for exactly 6 minutes and with all respect towards the guys who worked on it, i geniuenly don't get it. It looked promising but the game is confusing with it's menu and how it throws you out there without saying anything. And just overall even the fact that the controls with a controller aren't working as they should and the game is just a big dark room trying to off some switches with janky movement. I saw this game even before it was released but now i'm just sad and even for 2,55‚Ç¨ i'm still got disappointed",0
29836,"This is quite possibly the worst game that I have ever played in my life, like they tried, but they gave up halfway through trying and said ""meh release it"" Holy crap it is repulsively bad, people in charge of steam, just remove it from the store or make it free, this is quite possibly the reason someone once said ""video games suck"" and never played another one again.",0
29837,"I like it, just to relax",1
29838,"This game is deceptive in its depth. At first glance it is simple (not to say boring) in interface and gameplay. The basic 6 vial mode is almost trivial in difficulty with puzzles that I can solve in half a minute to a minute with fifteen to twenty moves. It becomes a game of optimization for me in how many moves can I shave off and how fast can I do it. As more vials/colors to be sorted are added solving the puzzle without clicking in a tiny placeholder vial becomes nightmarish. 

I was glad to have the color optimization feature because one of the default colors was nearly indistinguishable from the background on my screen with my eyes. Color acuity varies greatly and what screen is used can have a big impact as well.",1
29839,"A fun puzzle game akin to solitaire with some twists! The game is simple enough to figure out, but I'm sure difficult to master... especially when adding extra colors. Music is eclectic, energizing and enjoyable. Overall, I can see myself playing this when I need a moment to relax and catch my breath. Nice work!",1
29840,"This is a type of game that is popular on mobile and I've played multiple versions.

I like this type of game but this isn't a good execution of it. For one, there is no animation of the pouring between vials. For another there isn't really any sense of progress. You just pick a color count and go. Normally there is a progression of difficulty as well as color count (usually by reducing the vials) and ways to earn powerups for more difficult games.",0
29841,"Calling all organization enthusiasts and puzzle aficionados! Chemical Sort is a hidden gem on Steam, offering a delightful blend of logic and relaxation at a fantastic price point (especially with the current 50% discount!). This seemingly simple game quickly transforms into a captivating challenge that will test your strategic thinking and color coordination skills.

At its core, Chemical Sort is a digital test tube experiment gone awry. The game presents you with a series of vials filled with colorful liquids. Your mission? To sort the chaos by strategically transferring liquids between vials until each vial contains only one color. Sounds simple, right? Well, the catch lies in the transfer mechanic. You can only transfer liquid on top of another liquid if the colors are the same, and there's enough empty space in the destination vial. This seemingly straightforward rule quickly evolves into a complex web of colorful logic as the number of vials and colors increase.

The beauty of Chemical Sort lies in its accessibility. The basic mechanics are easy to grasp, making it perfect for casual gamers or those new to puzzle games. However, beneath this simple facade lies a surprisingly deep well of strategic thinking. As you progress, the puzzles become increasingly challenging, demanding careful planning and foresight. Each move needs to be meticulously considered, ensuring you don't create an unsolvable mess in the process.

But Chemical Sort isn't just about solving puzzles ‚Äì it's about the journey. The game boasts a calming and visually appealing aesthetic. The vibrant colors of the liquids pop against the clean background, creating a visually satisfying experience. The gentle soundtrack adds to the relaxing atmosphere, making it a perfect game to unwind after a long day.

Chemical Sort boasts a surprising amount of content for its price, especially with the current discount. With hundreds of levels to conquer, there's enough gameplay here to keep you entertained for hours. Additionally, the game offers a variety of difficulty settings, catering to both casual players and hardcore puzzlers.

Whether you're looking for a quick and relaxing mental break or a deep dive into strategic color sorting, Chemical Sort delivers an exceptional experience at an unbeatable price. So, if you're craving a game that's both visually appealing and intellectually stimulating, don't miss out on this hidden gem!

29842,"Now the is a fun little game, really cool",1
29843,"Update: Instead of responding and working on the game, the developer revoked my key. Anyway, the game might not be available for much longer due to assets from other games.

The game is a weird mix of assets from elsewhere, but the biggest culprit are empty stages and no map.

At its core, the game combines action and metroidvania components. You find yourself on a map with obstacles that cannot be conquered with your basic abilities. By exploring the map, you obtain skills such as double leap and slide, which allow you to push further. The game starts encouraging, but it quickly ruins everything with bad design.

While there is a small mini-map in the lower corner, you don‚Äôt have a full map that would fill out as you progress through the game. This is a problem because the game is made of filler content that doesn‚Äôt add anything. This shows up in the form of long and empty stretches that just waste your time. Also, you have no way of knowing if you found every secret. Even if you find a key for a locked door somewhere behind, you won‚Äôt even remember where it is.

Your character carries a sword and a gun with limited ammunition. The sword is not particularly useful because it has limited reach and some enemies are resistant to its attacks. You can even jump on some, but this is risky because you never know if the enemy will attack you back. The things enemies drop are money, health, and ammo. Since they also respawn as you go away, you can use this to grind for stuff.

The map is littered with money and secret locations that conceal a permanent upgrade. You can find a variety of stuff, such as the ability to see the enemy's health bar or a larger bag to carry more apples. At first, your hero can only take three hits, so keep an eye on that. The game uses a life system; you respawn right on the spot you die. However, once all lives are used, you will have to restart from the last save point. 

Coins are used to improve the attack power of all weapons or buy some other goodies. To prevent you from grinding and buying the best stuff right away, the purchases are locked behind levels. If you don‚Äôt find the upgrade for the next level, you won‚Äôt be able to buy new stuff.

The big elephant in the room are the game‚Äôs borrowed assets. The main character, for example, will be familiar to everyone who has played a popular run-and-gun game. Most of it is inconsistent with the general appearance, since you will continually notice parts that don't match. You will see one enemy in one style and another in an entirely another one.  There are also a number of strange bits poking out that cause your character to become stuck.",0
29844,"This game reminded me a lot of the time I played Super Nintendo in 1993, it made me remember those nostalgic plataform games from that time.

It starts a little slowly and teaches you how to play in an intuitive way, because without learning a certain function of the game, you won't be able to progress to new places.

The game has many coins scattered around the scenes, and when you kill enemies they drop coins, ammunition, food, one time it even dropped 1 life.

I found the shooting a little slow, but I saw that you can increase its speed as you progress by purchasing from the game's store. The coins you pick up throughout the scene are to be spent in these stores, to recharge life or buy information from what I saw.

I saw that you also have the freedom to go anywhere, there are many paths to explore, it's like an open world without forcing you to follow a logical path, there's always something hidden in these places.

The background music is very pleasant.

the player starts the game with 5 lives and can only receive 3 damage per life, but from what I saw you can increase the damage resistance found in a kind of heart on the map, I found it a little difficult at the beginning but once you get the hang of it you will although.

There is also the option to save the game, when you die you will return to the point where you saved in the same way you were with your lives.",1
29845,Simple but good! Hard to play üò®,1
29846,"The price is right. 

These are two more bland cages. Once again they both have the potential for something interesting to occur, and they each have opportunities for fun interactions, but again fall kind of flat.

As with the rest of Don‚Äôt Feed the Monkey‚Äôs 2099, it feels like a washed out version of the original.

That said, these are free, and they‚Äôre better than some of the cages in the base game. Plus they show a willingness to test new ideas, have the potential for expansion in and of themselves, and demonstrate the dev‚Äôs can and possibly will continue to expand and maintain the base game (sometimes even for free!).

As such I give this the thumbs up, and encourage you to try these if you enjoyed the base or first game.",1

its free, yeah, but that doesnt promise a good rating. if this costed money, it would be offensive. 

i get this is a passion project for someone but that passion seems more eager in getting it out than done right. the fact its on steam in this state is a huge red flag. first impressions matter and, like they say ""before you make a house, you build the foundation first"" 

Im guessing hiring a pro game designer is out of the question but maybe they can find am experienced partner to help them reign in their haste through all the systems in the game and make them revue/edit and do the systems with a little more concentration and time on each element. 

If not, Im fairly certain this will be the only version released ever",0

It isn't much, like at all. I've played for .1 hours as of this review and I don't see myself playing this for hours on end, but it's a nice bit of fun. I don't see how the whole ""interstellar guardians"" comes into it, but it's a nice quick free game that you might as well give a try, might be your thing.

There isn't much right now, I'd love to see more enemy variety, as (as of round 8, which is where i got to before failing) there were only 4 enemy types. I can see there are others, but when there's only 15 rounds per game, I'd like to see more variety sooner.
Also, different difficulties, adjusting quantity of enemies and their health, would be nice to see, and some more weapons especially, as the gunplay felt very limited and restricted.
I would also like to see more in the way of tutorials than what is currently present. You can see your controls but beyond that there is little explanation on how the different abilities work. It would be nice to have a tutorial section on the menu where you can get an explanation/demo as to how each ability works, and how to manage them (as i unintentionally sold one and had no clue what happened)

Basically, it's a quick arcadey wave shooter that's nice enough for a week into early access to get a positive review. The Early Access notes look great but I don't know how to feel about the releasing fully in 2023, I'm not sure how complete it could be by that point and it feels like the game will either be smaller than it has the potential to be or that it'll feel like it's still in early access upon release.

I'll definitely come back to this from time to time and I'm excited to see how it goes, I'll probably edit the review down the line after playing some more",1
29881,"This game could be a must have.

i say ""could"" because it's pretty simple, really fun, but still simple.

[h1]Intro[/h1]
[b]Juna - The Dreamwalker[/b] is an action-adventure game that focuses on exploration and puzzles. You are armed with a wand that can morph you into anything, both monster and object, and use their ability. It's a game that tests your creative thinking skills, figuring out what you can do with the abilities to clear the area.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 16+2 dungeons
- Unique bosses that require the use of a specific ability to beat
- Huge area to explore

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Sometimes it's hard to figure out where to go next with the numerous backtracking
- It's easy to get soft-locked
- Bombs' area and damage are too big

[b]Specs[/b]

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
[b]Juna - The Dreamwalker[/b] offers 2 kinds of display: 16-bit and 32-bit color. The 16-bit looks simpler and has a low pixel density, while the 32-bit one doesn't look pixelated at all. Both displays can take some time to get used to, but I ended up getting more comfortable with the 32-bit one. However, there is no way to switch the visuals in the game. You can only do so through the main menu.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story serves more as a way to progress the game. There isn't much depth and the dialogues are boring. Luckily, the game is quite straightforward, and there is a quest log that you can use to figure out where to go next. Sadly, the same quest log was bugged during my playthrough and showed me quests from the next few objectives in the future.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
Aside from the classic sword and shield, you are armed with a wand that can morph you into anything, both objects and monsters alike. There isn't much use in morphing into objects, but morphing into monsters will grant you their ability. Some are useless, some are especially important for your progression.

The game is highly explorable. There are just a lot of areas to explore and there are some areas that can be locked and meant to be progressed later. And this gives me a challenge; I would try to figure out how to reach some of the areas and it turns out that I could reach most of them this way, even if it took a long time to move the monster to the required area. And this brings us to the next problem.

[b]The Softlock[/b]
It's easy to get softlocked. Some locked areas are reachable by using monsters' abilities, even though you are not supposed to go there yet. These areas were supposed to be unlocked after you got a certain item, which was only available after you progressed with the game. Since you access the area with monster abilities, you won't be able to find a way back if you undo your transformation. I got stuck a lot this way, although luckily, the dev is quick enough to fix them after you report them.

You can get softlocked in dungeons too, though. Sometimes the game has a bug that either prevents you from progressing or locks you in one place. The occurrence for these ones is more random and can be resolved by resetting the game.

[b]Abilities[/b]
I like the monster's abilities. They are unique, and they don't look similar to the ones introduced in other games. Other Zelda-like games feel easy to beat since the key items are similar, but not in this one. Although there are still some items that are similar to other games like a bow and bombs, you won't use them that often. You'll have to use the unusual monster abilities and items that have a similar function to progress. That being said, since you need to learn how to use them, it's easy to get stuck if you are not creative enough.

Bombs give some issues to me. They have a huge range and deal high damage. I had to be very careful to disarm them in a way that wouldn't harm me, and getting hit by it depleted so much of my HP. I think I got damage more often to these rather than the enemies' attacks.

That being said, I like how big the sword range is. It can cover almost everything in front of you, making it easy to clear grass or hit the monsters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3297525152 

[b]Dungeons[/b]
The game requires a lot of backtracking, and you need to remember where they are to progress. This is especially true in dungeons. You will be forced to backtrack a lot, to the point that you might even have explored the whole dungeon several times by the time you finish it. I don't have any issues with it in the first few dungeons due to the small length, but some of the later dungeons can be a chore and confusing.

Bosses are varied. The early ones can be cheesed and very easy to beat. There is a difficulty spike starting from the middle half on the bosses, making them twice as tough and hit harder. They all have different weaknesses, which you need to figure out. Although the early bosses are straightforward, the latter ones aren't, forcing you to use more than one item in a certain order to damage them. And you need to be patient since the damage will be minimal. I prefer the boss fights this way since you need to be creative and think about how to use your items, although the drawback will be that you might not be able to figure out how to beat some of them if you have no idea what you are doing.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 24h. The rest of my playtime was spent getting the achievements. There is a lot of content in the game, and although some bosses are challenging, they are still not at the level that is hard to beat.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Juna - The Dreamwalker[/b] is a game with a unique concept. I like how you can morph into enemies and use their abilities, and how unique the abilities are compared to other games. With a lot of Zelda-like games, it felt as if I was playing the same game, but this game doesn't have that same feeling. Progression might not be obvious because of this, although it was not something that I have an issue with. If you like Zelda-like games, you'll definitely like this one.

29891,"This zelda-like is incredible. It invokes a feeling in me I didn't even know I could still feel. Its like links awakening mixed with minish cap and it somehow works incredible well. The mechanics are very unique as well (you can become literally anything using a magic rod). It has 8 regular dungeons and 8 ""dream"" areas and even a large zelda ""field"". This game is worth it easily at full price and I cannot recommend it enough (even with some of the crashing issues).",1
29892,"If you like Links Awakening, you must play this game.

Dev. is very responsive and has made numerous tweaks, usually same day, based on user feedback.  I also feel this game would be great for speedrunning as there are some fun sequence breaks possible.  It has the look and feel of a good Amiga game but much more responsive and fast paced.

You can transform into almost any other object or creature in the game and there are loads of hidden mechanics and interesting physics puzzles, much more so than Links Awakening.  The game is big, and depending on your problem solving abilities could easily take 50 hours or more for a first completionist playthru.

29893,Juna The Dreamwalker is a game that wears it's inspiration clearly on it's sleeve. If you enjoy the 2D Zelda formula then you'll enjoy what's on display here. It's not a masterpiece by any means but it's good enough to keep most players satisfied. I wish there was a rating between recommend and not recommend as there were enough issues here to hinder my enjoyment by quite a bit. For my full video review please see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yl0kxr0w6I,1
29894,"I've been playing this on my stream and it's definitely a lot of fun.  As others have said, it reminds me of the original Link's Awakening.  There are times when it's confusing, but there's a guide available for if you get stuck.  It's the Zelda game I've been looking for for years! I definitely recommend it.

I did initially get frustrated when dying because Continue sent me back to the start of the game, but if you choose Load instead then you'll get sent back to the last checkpoint.  I feel like they should be ""Continue from House"" or ""Continue from Last Checkpoint"" for clarity, but that's it.",1
29895,"L√ºtfen oyunlarƒ±nƒ±za bi tutorial bi y√∂nlendirme ekleyin. Kasabaya geldim, kasabayƒ± gezdim, oyunu kapadƒ±m √ß√ºnk√º ba≈üka bir ≈üey yapƒ±lmƒ±yor ya da yapƒ±lamƒ±yor.",0
29896,"          How about a modern ""Links Awakening"" with some ""Alundra"" thrown in? Another reviewer stated this and it fits nicely. It seems like this is a ""custom-everything"" Gamemaker project. The love and detail on display shines through despite the game's faults (are these subjective? I can never tell anymore...) The music is orchestral and uplifting though I can't decipher if it's Gamemaker stock or not... doesn't matter as long as it sounds great!
	
          In the World of Juna, the quantum foundation of existence is clearly skittles. This can be seen in the tasty rainbow scatter that rips apart your foes. As to whether or not Juna is herself made of skittles I cannot determine... perhaps it is only the force she is opposing?
	
          I'll confess that I started out loving this game and gushing over its aesthetic, visuals, charm, creativity and puzzle-logic. I greatly enjoyed at least half of what I played. By the time I threw in the towel I was cursing it. This doesn't mean the game is bad but rather that it needs more time to be perfected. I think the potential here is enormous and the developer's forthright responses to bugs is very appreciated. Whats more, they are working on a higher resolution version of the game with redrawn graphics throughout. 
	
          Bugs and crashes are numerous and I encountered one that corrupted my save file. Many of these have been fixed as of writing this. I would caution those playing to make save backups in a separate folder with dates or whatnot in the event of a corruption. 
	
          Performance suffers major slowdown on certain screens despite the pixel graphics. Perhaps this is a Gamemaker engine problem, or it may be my bogged down 2017 laptop (which chugged on these frequent screens). These aren't exactly modern graphics so I suspect that something is handled very inefficiently in Gamemaker (this is not a criticism of the deliberate graphics). 
	
          Without spoiling anything: In one particular dream sequence there is a jumping mechanic that is required to progress. This jumping mechanic is ""speedrun-glitch-skip"" logic in my opinion so I consider it unreasonable to expect the player to do this. This same mechanic is used in a later dungeon in any even more frustrating way.
	
          I made it to the seventh dungeon and had to call it quits. I could have consulted the developers walkthrough again but I am stubborn about these things on principle (to a fault) and don't consider progress worth it if a walkthrough has to be consulted more than a few times to continue... guess I won't ever be playing the La Mulana games then! ;) 
	
          For those more flexible regarding guides and who are more patient than I, there is a lot of creativity and ingenuity on display in this game! It is clearly a labor of love from the developer and I think it is worth ironing out whats here... I just hope they consider making the game a little bit more accessible with its cryptic sections. Perhaps portions of the walkt-hrough could be incorporated into the game as collectible pages that keep pace with whichever part of the game the player is in?
	
          Go try it out if you are like me and are craving more Zelda-Likes on steam. This game needs more attention, it could become one of the best with some ironing (just my opinion).
Thanks!",1
29897,"Very similar game in vibes to Alundra from PSX. It is good - I love Alundra. Exploration is similar, vibes are similar, dreamwalking is similar but slightly less detailed. 

BUT

The game is hard. Not in a combat meaning. But the puzzles and exploration is hard. In Alundra, exploration was like: ""Do something. Now, walk around and talk with everybody, until you find new dialogue. Then do something, then walk and talk some more."" Here - exploration is similar, but also - gimmick with changing form opens a lot of ways to solve puzzles and often I don't know if I don't have some kind of new power to move forward and have to keep exploring, or I don't see a way to solve my position with changing form. Like - to move super heavy crystal pillar, you have to be a raccoon.

In Alundra, there was a story teller, where you could spend some coins and get some tip of where you should go. I think, it would be great if something like this would appear in this game. Right now - I love it, but for now - I'm just in dungeon 2 after 2 hours of playing, and I was already checking solution for about 5 times to move forward.",1
29898,"The dlc has everything I hoped for in a long time. I loved the smaller scenarios in the older games (that are now published as Strategic Command Classic). It is perfect to have now all the innovations and improvements the series made so far also in the smaller scenarios. That hugely improves the variety. It also is great when you have only couple of hours on the weekend and want still finish a game. 
The two recent dlcs (Wars in America for American Civil War) and this one are a perfect addition and one can only hope there will be yet another dlc for Strategic Command War in Euopre and/or World at War.",1
29899,"This DLC brings some new and interesting scenarios for the game.

29906,"A speedrun game with fluent and smooth controls, clear and useful tutorials, great soundtrack, fun mechanics, and a few hours of playtime. 100% worth the price, as you can play levels over and over trying to beat your record each and every time.

29907,"What an interesting little game. As I understand it, everything from game programming and art design to soundtrack design and writing was done by one person. That is very impressive.

Although, that being said, the game is not perfect. At the time that I played I encountered a few bugs and the game overall felt a little janky. But, in fairness, I think the developer will fix those bugs soon, if he didn't fix them already. For now the most persistent and annoying ""bug"" (perhaps feature) that I noticed is that your character will sometimes miss when he's shooting.

Don't want to spoil the story, so all I can say is that the story doesn't seem like anything special up until about the middle of the game. And then it grabs you.

Also, I was surprised by some novel gameplay (even though it appeared only for a short time) close to the middle of the game.

Overall, I would recommend playing it if you want to play something short and interesting made by an indie developer.",1

29909,"Good thing I can say about the game - it brings back memories of Flashback game from 1992. Narrative in the game may be good but the game doesn't allow me to enjoy it.

Unfortunately the game is empty and hard.
- Fight mechanics is unforgiving. Zombies kill you from the first bite and you only have small window when you can land a bat swing at them.
- Levels are empty. You can wander around, look into empty rooms but there isn't anything that reward the exploration.
- There are no highlights on active areas or items. This means you have to spam ""Interact"" button while walking. It feels like pixel hunting.
- Control layout allows you to play with your left hand. Game expects you to quickly move fingers and not to miss the keys because zombies give you little time to react.

And finally I got stuck after about 1 hour of gameplay: https://youtu.be/3MLmatRbsE4

Overall I think the game may be way better if it won't be as hard.",0

29911,"[h2] Graphics [/h2]
Right away I'd tell you that the visual style might push you away and may seem cheaply made (like in old flash games), but you get used to it quickly and you can even notice that in some places the game is fairly well made and detailed (decorations and interior). Animations are simple and there are not a lot of them, but they are passable.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The main gameplay consists of finding items and fighting zombies. You're exploring different locations which differ in scale and look for the needed items to pass through to the next level, and sometimes you solve puzzles. Enemies can be killed with a baseball bat or a firearm. There's few ammo, and zombies can appear suddenly and kill you with one shot (bite). Beside that the game has a few surprises which can please you and add variety to the gameplay.

[h2] Story(no spoilers) [/h2] 
The premise of the game is fairly simple, but with each new level the plot gets more and more interesting and it makes you want to follow it. The story develops gradually and has a few unexpected moments. You see the development of the main character and his relationship with his family which helps to empathize with him much more. The writing and dialogues are good, thanks to which a lot of the characters are perceived as real people despite their appearances.

[h2] Music [/h2]
I liked the music. The compositions are fairly different and the fact that they were all played only with an acoustic guitar adds to the atmosphere.

[h2] Technical notes  [/h2]
I haven't noticed any serious bugs or errors. Everything works well.

[h2] What about the negatives? [/h2] 
Personally, I find the fact that the main character can miss while shooting to be the only major negative. It doesn't happen always, but sometimes it really pisses you off. It's a weird lottery. Thankfully, there are not that many enemies in the game, or rather in some levels there're few enemies and in some there's many and in some there's not a single enemy. And additionally, the pistol is not the only way to defend yourself, you can always choose to use melee combat.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
In the end you get a decent game with an interesting story and dark atmosphere. The levels are diverse and at times the game can surprise you. There are memorable and sincere moments that can draw emotions out.

The game challenges you and that's good, otherwise it would be a lot more boring. In some places you need to apply attentiveness and in other places you need to be quick and reactive. What I personally enjoyed is that the game doesn't lead you by hand and rewards curiosity and desire to explore every location. For example, you can find additional ammo or secrets and Easter eggs in some places. Talking about the latter, I also liked the vast number of references to the famous (and no so much) movies about zombies, and some of them are cleverly integrated to the main plot.

You can tell that the game was made will love and effort. For a solo developer that's a pretty well done job. Hope of Bion can be finished in 2-3 hours and I think it is worth its money and time.",1

29924,"Pombero, (a kind of protector of the forest and animals in the Paraguayan folklore), is a walking horror sim with some puzzles in the mix. The game looks absolutely amazing in the first minutes of gameplay, unfortunately, once you enter a more open world design, everything falls apart; a confusing map and a flashlight that will make you wish you had nighvision, and some game breaking bugs, (I fell through the map more than once), will make the game harder than it should have been. 
I'm pretty sure that with some patches, the game will become everything it was meant to be.

29925,"https://youtu.be/Ce1YCTU28rM

The Lord of the Night: Pombero Reborn embarks on an ambitious journey, tapping into folklore that promises an eerie and engaging gameplay. The visuals are intriguing, especially when experienced in 4K. However, this game seems to struggle under its own weight.

The major bug encountered during the resolution change from standard to 4K renders the menu persistent, which becomes more of an obstruction than a tool. It's disappointing to see such a fundamental oversight in a title that aims high in terms of graphics.

As for gameplay, the experience is a mixed bag. While the atmosphere is charged and the setting deeply immersive, navigation and progression can be frustratingly non-intuitive. Getting trapped in the living room, for instance, without any clear directives or logical cues is an exercise in patience and, occasionally, exasperation.

In conclusion, The Lord of the Night: Pombero Reborn is a game with a lot of potential that is unfortunately marred by some glaring bugs and ambiguous gameplay. While it has its moments of brilliance, players should be prepared for a few bumps in the road. Hopefully, future patches will rectify these issues, bringing the game closer to its true potential.

I would not recommend this game in its current state.",0
29926,Parts of it remind me of Parappa The Rapper and I loved that game. Other parts are more like a Mario Party mini game. Seems like it could be a fun pick-up & play for small sessions. Maybe it will get more exciting as more players come in. Enjoying it though.,1

29928,"Even for Early Access - that's not it. 
I don't even mind that its basically ARK with store/free assets. I also don't mind that it still has bugs. But that item descriptions got copied 1:1 from ARK into this game was a turn off. I hope the dev manages to take out everything ARK and makes it his own thing instead if a worse copy of another thing. Full review here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV5sBppGj5c",0
29929,"The first thing about Athos that caught my attention is that it's a hilariously blatant ripoff of ARK: Survival Evolved. The second thing is the screenshots I saw of their surprisingly accurate Spinosaurus model--my favorite dinosaur. I knew I had to check this game out. Because this game has a long way to go to compete with the actual ARK franchise in any way, shape, or form, I don't mind recommending it despite some of its lazy and stolen implementation of ARK mechanics.

Athos is clearly in the very earliest of Early Access stages and it shows, but after playing for a couple of hours I can at least say it is a fully-playable game which is more than can be said for most of Steam's new Early Access titles. So far I've only encountered a couple of bugs and they are not necessarily game-breaking. Although the player's character can swim and dive, the wildlife does not seem to have any water interaction coded yet and so they just walk across lake bottoms as though they were on dry land. I also discovered that, when building structures, certain unplaced structures such as the bed will interact with the player character if that structure's silhouette is moved directly underneath the character; this will cause the structure to ""wig out"" and send the character twirling around in the sky to no apparent detriment--but it is dizzying for the player. (EDIT 10/16/23: since posting this review the so-called ""flying bed"" issue has apparently been fixed.)

Many of the character's interactions are painfully slow, such as eating and resource gathering; not to mention the animations are awful, especially that of the eating animation which makes it look like the character is pulling the food right out of their butt. The last thing I'll say about the characters themselves is that there's currently no option to play a female, but in general the character creation is clearly still very much a work-in-progress and hopefully improvements to it are implemented soon. (EDIT 10/22/23: character creation has been overhauled and females are now an option!)

The wildlife models and animations are very hit-and-miss, with the current roster that I've encountered so far feeling a lot like early-game ARK with the standard parasaurs, dilophosaurs, raptors, rexes, and sarcos. I'm guessing the models themselves are all stock assets because they vary wildly from pristinely scientifically accurate (the parasaurs and Spinosaurus) to hideously inaccurate (the Sarcosuchus and Velociraptor). Most of their animations are not convincing either, for example the parasaurs look like they're tip-toeing everywhere and the rexes feel like they have no weight to them whatsoever.

The game itself could also be presented better, currently held back by the usage of obvious and cheap AI ""art"" and an embarrassingly cliche ""alien planet with dinosaurs"" lore. Hopefully as development continues they put some resources into actual artists and writers.

Despite its flaws as an Early Access title with lots of clear placeholders, Athos has a lot going for it too. The weather and lighting effects are really good--especially the thunderstorms and sunsets--the dinosaurs generally have good patterns and color varieties, the bed offers a Minecraft-like sleep mechanic which is something ARK actually lacks as far as I know, and in some respects there is good attention to detail such as the character holding a blueprint when in construction mode.

Aside from improving on the criticisms described above, what Athos really needs to do is stand out from ARK. As long as they don't get in legal trouble for it, I think initially ripping ARK off is a funny meme that gets people talking about it. I certainly wouldn't have heard of this game if the ARK content creators I watch hadn't mentioned it, and to that end I respect this business tactic. I am all for more ARK-like survival simulators, especially with the ARK franchise itself going in a more Souls-like direction with ARK 2, but I want other ARK-inspired games to deliver an experience that ARK doesn't. As the development of Athos continues, I don't want to see the same wildlife roster that ARK has. I don't want to see a ripped-off Scorched Earth, etc. I want to encounter new creatures and explore new landscapes that ARK doesn't have. If Athos doesn't achieve that, then it may risk falling into obscurity if not worse (legal trouble from Snail, Inc.).",1
29930,"Game is full of bugs. Haven't seen any fixes or updates in over 2 months. The last one didn't even address any issues. I read from someone that the developer posted another game before this in early access only to abandon it later on. I hope that this isn't the case here, although it is starting to look that way. Save your cash  until this game gets some of the needed attention it requires. At the current state it is not very playable, just frustrating.",0
29931,"I can't in good conscience give this game a positive review.  It's not ready for EA yet as it's very unfinished, in fact it feels like something was rushed to market, with the view to make it something the community wants?  I'm sorry but that's pretty lazy development.  I'm all for listening to the community and shaping it based on what the majority suggests, but you should also have some idea of a road-map in your own head as well rather than being totally reliant on community input.  At least that's how it comes across.

I get the point of EA.  To shape and polish a 'nearly finished' product.  This is not 'nearly finished', more like 'barely started'.

I won't be asking for a refund ... yet, and depending on how frequent the updates are and what they bring to the table, my review may yet be turned around.

I can see the potential in a game like this, and the idea is a fun one.  I'll reserve judgement until I see more patches and updates released.  I'm sorry, but as it stands it's definitely not worth the price, even on sale.  Let's see what the future holds, though.  Maybe it'll become worth it as time goes on.

Sorry, I know this is pretty scathing, but hopefully there's some useful advice in here as well.  Best of luck developing this.  As I said, I can see it's potential.",0
29932,This game is junk it's dark most of the time no matter what I set the day night cycle to. When you start a fire there's a red haze over the room. I tried twice to play but it just is NOT fun.,0
29933," constant lagg, character movement is not very fluid and lacks strafing in combat, no social filter ie can use names like ****licker9001 or womenwith****es

Game is pretty though, excellent lighting and environment. if you are looking for ark, go play ark.

as of making this review, game is not ready. if you like supporting games that are 0.5% market ready, sure.",0
29934,"This game is in a very early access stage, and there are several points to consider for a better understanding. While I'll give it a thumbs up, it's contingent on the developers' commitment to adding content and continuous updates. The game currently feels somewhat like a 'been there, done that' experience, reminiscent of Ark. However, there is promise here.

Should you buy it? Not just yet. I would recommend adding it to your wishlist and keeping an eye out for substantial updates.  As of this review, the game is on sale.

Athos EA Preview [Single Player]

[Stability]
FPS under 100 @ 1440 EPIC: Looks good.
FPS above 100 @ 1440 HIGH: Looks good.
FPS above 100 @ 1440 HIGH: Looks good; shadows not too great.
NO crashing or lag so far.

[Character]
Player animations are stiff, not many animations.
Camera angle is high.
No First Person View.
Not much in character creation [Still buggy].
Combat is sluggish (lack in animation overall)

[Environment]
Colorful and vibrant.
Lacks real immersion.
No real-world interaction animations with objects like chopping trees or mining.
No real threat [BIG PLUS FROM ARK].
Lack of Dino's (Feels empty)

[Sound]
Lacks immersion, feels looped.
Sound effects are dull.
Add character grunts while jumping, fighting, or interacting.

[Overall]
Can't say much as I just started playing and noticed all these things. It doesn't seem too dynamic and feels like more of just a basic start to early access. Looks promising if the Devs continue to update and add content. It's a much better experience compared to when I first played Ark.

29935,"Absolute trash.  Save your money and sanity by avoiding this quickly assembled mess of Unreal Marketplace assets.

https://youtu.be/G2x58vR_-CA

This developer launched his first asset cobbled together mess of a game (Junk Survivor) in early access less than six months ago and stated that it would be completed by the end of this year.  Instead of finishing that game, now he launches this game also in early access and is likely to quickly abandon this one as well.  ..This is NOT a good or promising pattern and basically shows that he is only launching these early access games to try and make a quick profit.  He makes lot of empty promises in the early access write up but it's pretty obvious that he never intends to actually finish or fix all of the bugs and problems.  

Anyone can buy assets and cobble them together on a map and hit the export button.. that is NOT impressive or something that people should pay their hard earned money for.  That is NOT a ""game"".. it's just more lazy trash cluttering the already terribly infested Steam platform.  


NOT RECOMMENDED.  ..Refunded and I only wish that I could refund my time to get that back as well.  *sighs*",0
29936,"I have been watching this game grow and progress for many weeks in discord. I just installed it after the latest patch and it is simply epic! It is visually stunning and so fun to play. The dev is very responsive, active, helpful and works very hard to get the patches out. Bravo! Woot!",1
29937,"I understand very well it is an ""early access"" game so there will be some changes to take place and it seems the developer is onto it and I really appreciate his quick feed back and response. One hardly get that from developers now.  I will give it another go and try to be patient :).  I just do not like the thought of restarting the grind to get split stat points.",1
29938,"The game has potential but is riddled with bugs right now.  Some dino's are frozen with nothing close to them (can just walk up and melee them to death without getting hit back), dinos get stuck on rocks/trees, taming does not always work (at least didn't for me), random deaths from very small step downs (or jumping up) - just a few bugs that I have personally experienced.  Response to bug posts on Discord is hit and miss (still waiting for responses for a few I have posted).  

Based on what I have read, I do think the devs are working to remedy issues but at this point this game is not ready for any meaningful game play - feels like a pre-alpha release that should have been limited to testers to address some of these very basic bugs.  Yes it's early but has more bugs than other EA games I have tried.  At this point, I'll put on hold and revisit in a few months.",0
29939,"It looked cute... I'm not giving it a bad rating or anything at this time, but I got a refund. I thought you would be able to play as Male or Female, but right now it only offers playing as a dude. I hate playing as a dude, I'm a woman and I like my character to be a woman, just a matter of preference. The game is in beta so I believe it will eventually have what I want, but it's no right now. Its also a little to bright for my eyeballs, and the dinos are a little to cartoony xD
I'm sure it will be good someday and I may be back.",1
29940,"REFUNDED
I can not at this time and state of the game recommend it to anyone.
did a lan game with my husband ... and things disapear when moving them between inventories
it need rebalancing on the crafting materials for building.
it needs alot of work before its even EA ready.
save your money till its further in development",0
29941,"Requested refund. I want there to be more games like ARK, but this seems to have borrowed a lot of the ideas (e.g. UI, craftable items - I think to the point it it costs the same type/amount of mats to craft things) but feels like playing a knock off version of ARK, rather than a game inspired by ARK. What made me refund: I killed a parasaur to death with an axe (standing on the same spot) because it didn't run away. Yes it's EA, but as it stands it's not IMO something worth supporting yet - I wish all the best to the developers if they are sincere about creating the game as described.",0
29942,"Dont waste your time if you have Ark installed. Very early access, shows promise but not worth playing currently.",0
29943,"Some may call it a ‚ÄúRip off Ark‚Äù but that‚Äôs not at all what the dev is trying to create. They have their own plans in place, I think it has the potential to be up there with Ark, could use some optimization and when more of their roadmap is implemented I believe it will become something great for the community of both Ark and Athos, to not fight and bicker but come together to make both games even greater (: well done devs on this, great foundation, can‚Äôt wait to see what else is to come",1
29944,"i have gotten a refund!! I love the game i spent a few hours on single player built a base ect but i couldnt lvl any higher than 28 so therefor could not learn any more engrams so i saved to come back later!! And the game saved but when i loaded my save it started me on the beach and all i had done was gone! Ill wait for it to improve!! Dont waste your money!! All the people saying its a ARK rip off its not its better in alot of ways an i played ark for 8 years. Was hoping this would have been good to play while i wait for ASA

",1
29945,"okay came back to the game today AND the earlier save game
locks up/freezes all the time now. np it happens. 
started fresh  no freezing there, HOWEVER  
controls feel sluggish and unresponsive. specially when harvesting and fighting,
also food and water eat one berry at a time way too long 
the game looks great but cant recommend it in current state im afraid
",0
29946,"i like the game. but needs alot of work.  will try to play it later. alot of lag, gathering animation is way off, same with any animal fighting. not a smooth gameplay.",0
29947,"After less than half an hour, nah. Right now, it's basically just blue light special Ark. Might be worth visiting in the future, but for now, it's not worth it.
Not going to request a refund, though. Indie devs are still my heroes, even when they miss. And who knows, 6 months from now, this might be worth diving further into.",0
29948,"At first I really liked this game, but as it progresses and changes through development, it is looking more and more like an ARK remake. If that is your thing, great. As for me, I am disappointed that the only way to advance skills will be through trader buys after you reach level 28. It appears there will be no advancement in level past the level 28 cap to progress naturally instead of being forced to hunt down and grind for trader bought advancements. Not exactly the primitive survival game it first started as. Kind of regret buying this as early access as it came out and not waiting to see where it would go. Yes, it is still changing, but every new update so far has made it more and more like ARK and less like a unique game. It is great, if this is what you are into, just not to my liking anymore as it progresses into a copy of another game and not really it's own thing.",1
29949,"Athos is still pretty early in its development but I can really see the potential here! This game has ARK vibes, but in my opinion there's a lot of things more improved here, ine uncludingnthe smoother graphics, and it seems to be optimized well. From what I've played so far some of the game movements and animations are rough, but they are smooth enough that I don't really pay much mind to them.

I absolutely love that you can host your own server, no extra charge, to play with your friends. Downside is that the server isn't up while the host is offline. But then again everyone can have their own server and you can just join in on their server to continue playing (albeit you have to start over but not really a setback in my opinion). This option allows for friends to play together. There is a bit of a set back with this feature, as that anyone can join your server, there's no option to add a password or to make it private. Something I hope they add in the future as it would help.

The animations I mentioned earlier that were rough are just Dino movements, movements past resources already farmed are a bit glitchy, and the fire animation is very old school game, all of these could be improved. Again this is still early access and I see so much potential here, so I have hope for improvements!

Things I would love to see: More cosmetic options in character creation (changing tattoos, height to name a few), more options for your hosted world/single player (ability to increase time resources spawn, increase Dino spawn rates, creative mode for builders?), more building options (walls, doors, decor items, etc), holiday event items possibly dropping from dinos, torches auto turning off at sunrise would be helpful, mass eating and drinking of water (so you can fill the food and water up faster). These are just suggestions but things that I think would improve the overall game. 

Something I had to discover too: You can split stacks by shift+left clicking and dragging, just a tip!

I will definitely keep playing this and see how it develops, it's also something I recommend!",1
29950,"I played this game for a whole whopping 8 minutes. Character slides before running. Running, hitting, jumping need to be polished so bad. The game play above is not how this game runs. Between the 5 servers to choose from, only 1 server having 4 people on it the game runs bad. I am  not sure if its a server issue, game issue, or both. From what I read it does seem very promising in the future but as of now to me it is not playable. It needs a lot of work and with a price tag of $25 I will get a refund. Maybe a $10 - $15 price tag I would of kept it in my library. I wish the devs the best & hope to see this game in the future.",0
29951,"I am very surprised how stable Athos is in Early Access, really fun it's Neojac Entertainment take on Ark Evolved. I have to say it's better than Ark, how well it doesn't crash no bugs and glitches I have encountered so far. I am playing on 1440p at 165 at high settings and it's very smooth. If you like dino's, sruvival and crafting then this game is perfect.",1
29952,"The game is fun. Despite having bugs, which is understandable for an early access game.
Some bugs are quite funny, but have been fixed pretty much within 4 days of the devs being told about them.
I also understand that several features have yet to be implemented, I will still continue playing this game.  I do enjoy it.
A friend had also gifted me the game as well.",1
29953,"I recommend this game. If you are a fan of ARK this game is right for you. Yes it is Early Access but the devs are listening to the community and are making updates on the regular. For a game that is early access it does have some issues but nothing crazy. I remember how many issues ARK had at release and they took months if not a year to fix them.  If the devs keep up the updates this will be a solid game and you can't beat the price compared to ARK.












































",1
29954,"The short answer of this review is only buy this game if you want to support the devs. As of right now the game feels like its in its alpha phase. There isnt really much to do in the game as of right now. the gameplay loop as of right now is make a spear kill dinos until spear breaks and repeat. They have added a way to tame dinos but you cant interact with them in any way! no riding, no moving them, you cant even open their inventory. The game definitely has the potential to be an alternative to ark with its own unique feel in some ways, however the game at the moment has close to nothing to do and i would highly recommend waiting for more content to be released before buying.",1
29955,Having tried this game.. I would say save your money and watch it further on the wishlist. It does have promise but it  still needs alot of work. The building mechanics can be exasperating as foundations don't snap so you are having to maneuver the foundations around to make them fit ..that is if they hadn't destroyed themselves in the meantime. The crafting seems pretty straight forward but there are hiccups along the way . when trying to use items in your taskbar. The game needs alot of work before its released,0
29956,"amazing game that needs to be recognized! yes it does feel like a knock off of ark at first but you quickly see the full potential in the game and realize its NOTHING like ark in game. this game could almost kick ark off the spot light with a few good updates and i hope to see that happen honestly!! Oh p.s. for anyone who plays ark and sees this, Athos is on time with their updates and doesn't leave you hanging XD!",1
29957,this game is gonna need a lot of work.. game gets grainy after a certain amount of time played and you have to log out log back in to fix.... don't get me wrong i like survival games but this one yes is new and all but for the amount of time farming resources you should get some mats back if destroyed with hammer.,1
29958,"Athos"" is an early-development game that shows tremendous promise, thanks to the dedicated team at Neojac Entertainment Inc. While there are some noticeable bugs, the active commitment of the developers to address and resolve issues is commendable.

One of the standout features of this game is the developer's attentiveness to player feedback. Neojac Entertainment Inc. is actively listening to their player community, taking into account their needs and wants. This level of engagement ensures that the game is evolving in a direction that resonates with its player base. It's a refreshing approach that's often missing in the gaming industry.

However, it's important to note that ""Athos"" is still in early development, which means it comes with its share of bugs and imperfections. The game world might have a few rough edges, and players might encounter some technical hiccups along the way. But, it's crucial to appreciate the transparency of the development team in acknowledging these issues and their evident hard work to find and fix them.

For players who enjoy being a part of a game's growth from the ground up, ""Athos"" offers a unique opportunity. The potential of this game is undeniable, and with the dedicated team's continuous efforts, it's likely to become an even more impressive and polished experience as development progresses.

In conclusion, ""Athos"" is an early-development game that shows tremendous promise, thanks to the dedicated team at Neojac Entertainment Inc. While there are some noticeable bugs, the active commitment of the developers to address and resolve issues is commendable.",1
29959,Great looking game with great promise! I hope to see this game really take off!,1
29960,Now this game i can honestly recommend to anyone its a very fun game ... still in very early stages but Neojack and the team are smashing it with the updates and pushing big updates weekly.. so heads up to that so if you want a cool game made by amazing devs join the discord and def get yourself this game its gooddddd...  yes it does still need work but so far updates are constant,1
29961,"The game is okay at best right now. Still lots to do. I will say that there is some concern when buying this game. The developer is working on like 5 different games, so some of them get neglected while he works on other things. If you're okay with that, cool. I honesty don't understand why indy devs spread themselves so thin like this, instead of focusing ALL attention on one game at a time. Anyway, Athos is alright, but definitely almost a 1:1 copy of Ark. It's like Ark from Wish...lol",1
29962,"Poor quality game.
Clunky
Unintuitive
Poor in game logic such as loss of inventory following loss of connection. Everything not in hot bar just goes!",0
29963,"i honestly do not understand a lot of the hate this game gets. is every racing game a blatant ripoff off the first, whatever that is? is every shooter?

yes, it is heavily inspired by ark but who cares? if you do care about that you have some serious issues, this is actually making me mad, like the children that fight each other over xbox vs playstation.

the game is clearly in *VERY* early access and that is made clear by the dev, who seems to be quite active fixing things which is the most important thing to me.
yes, it does require some refinement, but that's being worked on, if you can't take it if a game is in early access, don't buy games that are in early access, it's really that simple. people would be a lot more helpful if they told the dev if they found bugs rather than come here and complain about something that was obviously going to be an unfinished product.


i would like to see athos going somewhere and in the meantime i'm fine with some bugs, as i said... early access, if that doesn't ring a bell... look it up. ark still has quite a few bugs that were there from the very beginning and have never been adressed so... give the dev some time to work on it, early access is not just the 'i want to make money asap' option, it also gives devs the chance to find not only more bugs to fix, but to find them faster, granted people actually give them a heads up rather than go on a rant about the state the game is *currently* in.


long story short, if you can live with a game that is still in very early access i would recommend giving it a try, but not be discouraged if it isn't perfect - as it won't be. dev seems to be actively working on the game and that should be the most important thing in early access, not a perfect result - which would ultimately take away any reason for early access anyway.",1
29964,"First And Foremost, This Is Not ARK or Rust! This I Inspired By ARK, But It Is It's Own Game. The Developer Is Constantly Updating, Patching, And Taking Support Seriously. I Have Played A Lot Of Early Access And This One Is Marked For Great Potential And Has Much To Come. If You Like Third Person Grinding, Crafting, Dinos, Tighty Whities And A Map The Size Of Texas! Than, Give This A Spin.",1
29965,"I have 79 minutes on record so far for this game and that's all it took for me to love this game already. Not only are the graphics top notch but the game play is amazing, the crafting is easy to understand and the combat is great too. I played in co-op mode with my hubby Nelsinfinity, and it was amazing, i had one disconnect issue but loaded back in quickly and without any issues after that. It was fun to play and i cant get over the graphics on the beach it was so pretty. If you like survival, Dino's and pretty views definitely check this game out, its so worth it.",1
29966,This reminds me more of Conan Exiles than ARK: Survival Evolved. Not a bad game. I just need to do some YouTube University about how to play.,1
29967,So Far it's Good there are bug's but the Dev's are working on them.,1
29968,this game is awesome keep up the good work. and keep the updates coming :),1

So far the game is great, the mechanics have been flawless for me, from harvesting resources, crafting system, leveling up skills, unlocking blueprints and more. 

The building is very clean, snaps easily, rotates smoothly, placing objects you make like the campfire, bed and such place with ease and are allowed just about anywhere reasonable (note placing bed down into a 1x1 can be buggy as it cant figure where your placing when standing inside)

The AI dinosaurs fight each other and seem to display passive and aggressive detection to you, as some just mosey on by, while others more predator like will began to chase you, trying to hunt you down. Did notice tho, that if you can get distance from them, they will just give up and move along elsewhere, so i like that your not forced to fight.

The combat with the dinosaurs is simple, not a lot other then you hitting them and them biting you. Your able to stand under some larger ones at their feet and just whoop them till you win as they cant attack you and don't know how to counter it. Still they look pretty cool visually, with their unique colors and differences in appearances, but need a bit more in depth animations, pathing, combat and such will need to be worked on. Which i'm sure the dev or devs will more then get up and going.

Your stats: the depletion is very good, fair 100% imo, and the nutrients gained from berries (stamina berries, food berries, water berries...not their names but what they help with) and meats gained from dinosaurs give you a decent and fair amount tbh. I do not think this needs any work as it seems perfect to me.

The durability of tools & weapons: The durability is great, lasts for a decent amount of time on just the basic tools and weapons. Plus the crafting costs for these is completely 100% feasible and done well.

As for the graphics: I am running all the graphics on epic, highest settings, vsync on and have smooth game play, recording and all. Looks stunning to top it off, as the atmosphere just seems so nice. The sun going up and down, casts some odd shadows tho which seem like ur lagging but just move and you will see the game play is smooth still, its just the simply weird shadows casting lol

When harvesting resources, its an auto collect when chopping trees, and rocks, while others like fiber, single stones, wood logs and stuff like this are manual pickup, but done so with ease. Enjoyed every bit of gaining resources.

The keybindings were a huge thing for me as their simple but fully customizable, and not just bind to new keys, they even display the proper keys you bound in game when interacting with things. (Example: picking up a single stone, by default prompts E key, i changed to F key, then did the same thing and it now prompts to pickup with the F key.... with other keys as well. (I did this just to test the feature)

When launching the game, you have the choice to join a game, host your own or through the hosted tab you can set to play single player, which i love tbh, i enjoy playing solo and occasionally i can host a game and allow others to join my game. Your also able to adjust game settings and multipliers for the game as well before loading into it, and this applies whether you host or single play the game. I love the fact i can customize the game to my preference.

The devs are so commutative and quick to tend to comments, feedback and such already. There have been some bugs and things needing fix or added to the game, and the devs been on point to addressing and fixing them right away, 100% to the dev team.

All around i'm loving the game, and would highly recommend to anyone, especially if they like a Ark style game, or even just dinosaurs and survival, plus the added twist to taming is neat. Game def is an A+ to me, keep up the amazing work yall :)

Will continue to update my review as I progress in my YouTube series, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecUPxk7lgb0U1_dGqhihow

Plus if you love Zombiezzzz and survival, in the same style this game is basically, with the same excellent development, then check out their other game called Junk Survivor: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1861630/Junk_Survivor/",1

29975,"As it is early access it is a bit tough in spot but shines in other. The scenery is glorious and the dinos are detailed. There are ncp's and new ones are continually dded. There is a start of a quest system  which adds variety.  Dinos are tamable and right now  some ridable. The  new UI shines. The learning  system  is  not as usual, but works. The server version has a major issue. trying to shot with arrows is frustrating, but in sp it is smooth. The models are  excellent. To top it off  this dev is the first I experience to actually  talk to the players in steam.  So obvisiously there is pride in the game.",1

-The Dash ability is stronger than the weapon and just makes you feel the flash running through a crowd
-The Story itself is kinda funny concept
-The Music is lovely and reminds me of either DOOM or Megaman
-The Cute little animations are nice to look at, especially the upgrade art
-Speaking of upgrades, the cool abilities are so fun to get
-The Village system isn't something you'd normally see in this type of game

Cons
-Stuff is too expensive considering you don't get a lot of money
-I wish the money would be pulled in like a magnet
-The buddy dies too quick and makes me sad :(
-I wish r-shift could run so I could used WASD (My arrows no wrok)

Other than that this game is sooo arcadey and I love it

29979,"Positive:
- vampire survivor like game
- ok-ish graphics and music
- there is passive hp regen
- interesting concept with the dash
- cheap

Negative:
- the game is 4GB+???

Lacking:
- screen resolution setting to adjust game screen size
- sound off toggle, there is only music off toggle currently
- keybind setting

Suggestions:
- buddies should NOT be allowed to be killed. It is very anti-synergistic with the dash concept
- increase the base attack speed of all weapon thrown from player + buddies. It is just too slow. On the other hand, once that is done, increase the spawn size of peasants on all levels, I wanna see a horde of angry peasants dying quickly on all levels.
- when destroying things on the map, have a chance to give random bonuses that lasts for the current level. E,g, bonus damage/speed/attack speed/buddy/armor etc.

I will change my review to positive once there are changes made to the game from my feedback.",0

at first blush, there's some noticeable jank (the main menu, the inability to actually aim your bazooka, etc.). but this is such a nitpick, because the game is so fun and polished where it matters most: the design, and the fun factor.

even just playing 1v1, it is SO FUN. and the game itself is fucking hilarious, between how the game is designed for screwing over your friends‚Äîbut also those sound effects? genuinely some of the funniest I've ever heard, holy shit.

30021,"I got this ""game"" for free and it immediately gave asset-flip vibes, and boy was I right. This isn't even a game; there is no gameplay. If for whatever insane reason you're actually considering buying this just know that you can not; jump, crouch, prone, loot enemies, craft, or really ANYTHING besides walk around a stock world and shoot AI-less, motionless zombies. It's just another example of 3 different asset packs flipped to scam people, disguised as an ""early access survival"" DayZ reskin. This isn't even a game and I highly doubt it ever will be, here's some ""gameplay"" from my review/first impressions to serve as proof of exactly what I'm talking about: https://youtu.be/UofKx6SmZYs

Don't ever buy this.",0
30022,"The game, as it is, is a big map where the trees and buildings pop in as you approach. They are filled with mostly nothing, but there are some random bullets and cleaning supplies placed in the middle of empty rooms. The zombies barely notice that you are there and drop in two punches, making getting firearms superfluous. The hunger and thirst meter drops so quickly that I died after playing for 10 minutes. That's not how humans work, not even a little. This needs to come off steam and have the 2-3 years of development the dev says in the early access section done before it returns. 

https://youtu.be/uZMhKkd7n4U",0
30023,"This game have a potential to be a DayZ single player experience or small coop experience like Valheim just with zombie and hostile survivor. Need more basic movement like jumping, crouching, and dodge roll mechanic and cover system. More dense zombie population. Fix the collision collider in some house mesh. At least with those things will be better experience.",1
30024,Hello. game is very bad optimised. with settings on very low and the worsdt resolution possible only 40 fps. its a good idea and it can have potential. i had some problems with the movement animations. idk more things because i cant play it with  20-40 fps.,0
30025,"Deadpoint is a fun and well-developed game that offers a massive map, loads of guns, and impressive gunplay. While it does have some rough edges, there's nothing game-breaking that ruins the experience. The game features both scavs and zombies, meaning that you're not just constantly shooting at mindless zombies the entire time. The gunfights are exciting, thanks to the solid gunplay.

You might be wondering, ""Why wouldn't I just buy DayZ?"" First of all, DayZ is 70 AUD, whereas Deadpoint is only 7 AUD. Despite the price difference, I can easily argue that Deadpoint can keep you more entertained.

Even if you aren't a fan of zombie games, Deadpoint is still very enjoyable. I personally am not a huge fan of zombie games, having only completed The Last of Us, but I still find Deadpoint very fun. The combination of scavenging, battling both scavs and zombies, and the overall dynamic gameplay makes it a game worth trying, especially considering its affordable price.",1
30026,"the price is quite cheap, and the gameplay is also good, I highly recommend this game",1
30027,"For a 2 dollar Pre-Alpha build, this is not bad. It has some of the basics of the open world survival, like looting, hunger/thirst, zombies, enemy scavs, gunplay and clothing, vehicles, and even a rudimentary trader. They definitely need some refining, but they are there. The gunplay was honestly feeling pretty good if I were to highlight anything. I purchased this as more of an investment into the future of the game, as I can tell that the devs clearly have some vision with this game that they are trying to go through with. 

BUGS/ISSUES I NOTICED:
When you kill an enemy scav, their torso disappears.
When aiming down sights, the third person crosshair stays on screen, blocking the iron sights. 
Different ammo types are all called 'Ammo'.
Bears are way too weak, and disappear when killed.
Too many bushes in the forest area. Hard to see anything.
Third person camera needs to be more right of the character to see better.
When attempting to discard your equipped weapon, the 'discard' button appears off screen and is unreachable. 
You can hear zombie sounds from almost everywhere, yet barely see any zombies. 
Switching backpacks is almost impossible. 

FOR THE DEVELOPERS:
What you have here is a good start. You can turn this into something REALLY good, but I think right now you need to focus on refining the gameplay rather than adding new guns and locations. Refine the movement, refine the inventory, refine the shooting and the AI, add more mechanics and features rather than content. Base building/barricading, more crafting, more hunting, vehicle upgrading, even maybe a leveling system. You can add more guns when the gameplay is solid. I think you can make a really great game out of this if you just focus on good and interesting features and mechanics. That is what will get people to play. 
",1
30028,"The game in it's current state you play the man with the world's fastest metabolism. Food and thirst burn down quick. so fast that moments after hitting zero your character will drop dead on the spot. So get your running shoes on cause it's a constant race to find the two resources that will kill you quickest if they hit zero. 

Initial humor aside let me get the bad out of the way.  At the time of posting I'm nearing two hours into the game, not quite there.  It's glitchy, you occasionally fall through things, zombies clip partly but do not travel through walls. The buildings fell randomly plopped and some are repeated.  

HOWEVER, that's to be expected in an alpha build of a game. it's not a bad framework so far. I've only fallen through the world once. Character can sort of swim, the weapons feel/sound decent, the zombies move ok. It's..more functional that many alpha builds I've played on steam. 

All that AND the best part? The dev does seem to be accepting criticism pretty well.  I know, I know supposed to be talking about the game not the creator  but hear me out. I've played games in similar states of progress and design and a lot of the creators (not all) don't know how to accept input. So it's nice to see someone noting issues and being friendly as they  get  the game's issues sent in to them. Hard not to appreciate it. 

Should you get it? Well, if you can accept it's alpha with a loooonngg ways to go and want to chuckle and silly bugs and growing pains, go for it. If not? then maybe wait till later on this one.",1
30029,"Its a pretty fun and cheap game. It does have quite a few bugs, but its to be expected from an early access game, and i hope most of the issues will be fixed in the future. Overall 7/10, would recommend, and its pretty decent for its price.",1

Its still in early access, some rough edges but mechanically very in depth and fun, the combat/gunplay is satisfying, good variety of weapons and zombies.

The open world map is very good and large as well, looting and crafting is great, vehicles are fun to drive and very useful,
there is also an in depth building system though i haven't tried that out yet.

Sample Gameplay: https://youtu.be/PEewQ7ICGBU

30038,"I met a russian friend while finding a way to glitch through the locked door and wash the secret thing behind it. Truly an incredible experience.



Feedback for the devs:
!!I am using a Quest 2 with original controllers through Virtual Desktop!!
Issues:
‚Ä¢ Moving forwards is sometimes buggy and i had to resort to moving sideways / backwards in order to navigate the world.
‚Ä¢ Teleport motion seems to randomly spin me around every now and again
‚Ä¢ Phasing through objects is really simple, allowing anyone to just walk through the locked door
‚Ä¢ Objects (especially the pressure washer) easily get stuck inside walls and its very annoying

Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ Make washing dirt off emmit particles of some sort, currently its unsatisfying as the texture just vanishes as if nothing was
‚Ä¢ There should be an option for background music
‚Ä¢ Maybe make it so where you shoot the gun becomes shiny for a certain period of time (as if it were wet)

Good things:
‚Ä¢ Public lobby system is very easy to use
‚Ä¢ Sponge is satisfyingly precise
‚Ä¢ Good sound design (apart from everything being a little too empty and silent)

Keep going guys! I'm sure you can make a well polished game out of this",1

https://youtu.be/Zdkf0Jbkj2A?si=rTwJUsOmKohSgK6H

Truly a great one, can't wait to see the future of it.",1
30040,"I remember some time ago seeing the concept of this game brought up on Reddit, and I was absolutely excited at the prospect. The dev was kind and I appreciated what they had to say about it. Having fallen out of Reddit, I was never sure if this would have come about to be an actual playable experience.

Words cannot describe how overjoyed I was to see this game here and to take a crack at it. It's a calming and enjoyable experience with a fun idea at its heart. I love that there's a reward system that allows you to choose area's of the hub to open up and explore. There's a solid foundation here just like I knew there would be, and its been taken a step up beyond any of my expectations. 

One of my favorite idea's here is being able to load in 3D models externally in-game to clean, either by you choosing or it being randomized which lends to a very large pull of potential. It feels as satisfying as it looks and I hope that this title will continue to build upon its strengths. 

One of my hopes is that one day, though quite the undertaking I'm sure, players will be able to load or create custom environments and maps that can be shared, as while it is fun to clean items and objects, the idea of cleaning larger area's by the community would truly set this ahead of any other power washing VR title I can think of. Cheers and thanks for the fun~",1

Under Pressure is a VR pressure washer sim. It is currently in a very early stages of EA, but already has a solid gameplay loop and plenty of content, thanks to Sketchfab integration. I am not a fan of chore simulating games, but  still enjoyed playing it for an hour.

Pressure washing mechanics are superb: from realistic changes of textures during cleaning to a responsive controller rumble. Main gameplay loop is simple: you clean stuff and get coins for it, that can be used for unlocking new areas and upgrading the pressure. And the game has some additional multiplayer minigames and even water propelled flight mode. 

On the minus side: it currently seams to launch in ""always online"" mode, making offline single player impossible.",1

30043,"This is a really nice wind-down-after-a-long-day game. Bonus points if you chat with a buddy while you pressure wash. Thanks for sharing your game for free, OP. Saw you talk about it on reddit and tried it out. It's a nice game.",1
30044,"Honestly, it doesn't have much content and lacks graphics.
There are also near-constant FPS issues.

However, I do think it is worth it for about an hour so if you have a friend or couple to mess around with for a while. It is a really fun concept with a couple small extra things that aren't just cleaning which can keep you and your friends entertained for a bit.

I really hope this game improves over time and becomes a proper game, which, honestly, once the issues (mainly the FPS issues) are fixed, I would even want to pay money for :D",1

30087,"[b]Summary:[/b] At the time of this writing, this is a game you should skip. The content / adult scenes are just not good. Compounded by basic skins, bad camera control, and  a disappointing ending.

[b]Technology:[/b] This is a unity engine game. So at least a decently powerful baseline to work with. If only Unity didn't cause new problems via their garbage licence agreement.

[b]Visuals:[/b] Very basic. All of the characters are anime - like. This part is acceptable. While the skins for those you interact with could use some more detail, that is more a neutral than a negative. You can squeeze pretty good smut out of pixel art if done well. The partners / antagonists are still pretty generic. Rooms and objects are the same or are slightly color shifted. Static NPCs are scattered about. They may move / or not, but they are not interactive. The draw distance of a room is intentionally hobbled no matter what quality setting you select. You can see effectively 3-4 steps in front of you in a permanent 'Superman Fog'.

[b]Audio:[/b] Also very basic. there are some audio queues that you need to listen for in the game loop. There are also jumpscare noises that occasionally occur.

[b]Game Loop:[/b] This is effectively a 'walking simulator' where you need to travel through 500 rooms total to get to the end. There is a checkpoint every 25 rooms. The checkpoint is a 'lounge room' with a side door that sometimes opens to show a scene. There's bunny suit girl who at least talks to you, and a save station next to her. There is also a notepad you can find and read in this room. There are other people here. They do nothing. Between checkpoints you look for the unlocked door. Not all doors are unlocked and you have to find them to proceed to the next room. Occasionally you will find Static NPCs and there will be occasional jumpscares from a sign that has a picture of one of the pursuing girls. If you are being chased, you'll get a very obvious clue and you want to keep moving to the next room as quickly as possible. You take damage from the pursuing girl and losing is just a back to title screen. After 100 rooms you can do a scene with one of the pursuing girls at the checkpoint by talking to her. After you clear 500 rooms you wind up in the 'ending room'. You will claim your prize: [spoiler] a couch that dubs you as owner of the hotel. [/spoiler] There is no end scene or interactive NPCs that I could find other than one you can talk to.

[b]The good stuff:[/b] All of the above I might be able to give this a 5 or 6 out of 10, it was okay review if the scenes were good. They are not. The models all pose and move in the same way. The camera controls are fixed locations and zooming in does not appear to be an option. The poses are equally basic, and the female models seem censored or underwear only in some cases. Your character is a blue outline - which I could forgive, provided the scenes were actually good. The camera limitation also applies in the game as you move around you are moving as if on a grid. There is no fine resolution to your movement so you could look at the simple models at certain angles or crouch, or anything to make viewing them better.

[b]How to improve this:[/b] I'm not a fan of ""Game bad. lol!"" so I want to point out some constructive things for the devs to put their effort towards if they want this game to be better and ultimately more interesting to play for the gameplay and lewd reasons.
- Improve interactivity: This includes more NPCs to talk with or heck, even lewd with. It's a light content game, but that content needs to be heavier than air. Fix timing for captions so that they persist long enough to read. Longer responses tend to zip by too fast.
- improve character skins / skin variety. You get to the 'seen em all' threshold way too quick. Some palette swaps and clothing mods will easily improve the variety. Coupled with the above, that's a good improvement.
- A better draw distance. I'm not sure if the choice was made to allow potato class PCs to run this or what, but it is an artificial difficulty and it was overall annoying. Changing some of the room surface textures / adding more textures would also be a visual improvement.
- Make the scenes worth the bother. I feel like the music is for a Daytime TV Judge and while the starting pose is all right, the bad camera, below average textures, and almost mechanical response movement did not inspire anything of value. I can accept blue outline dude, but make the model and model movement interesting.
- Some kind of interactive ending. I did the last 25 rooms twice because I thought I missed a detail. It's especially disappointing because you do finally get bunny girl looking available, but instead it's just a tease.",0
30088,"Can`t really recommend this game. its a bit like spooky`s but not very well balanced, lots of rooms with lots of locked doors and thin hallways and staircases mean every chase is multiple rooms of RNG as to dying or not.

it fails hard as a H-game as well, death is just game over while you occasionally see 2 - 3 people doing something lewd in the hallway.

it had potential but i honestly can`t recommend it as a Spooky clone or an H-game.",0
30089,"When it comes to H-Games we get either hidden gems, or train wrecks with very little in between. 
(TL:DR)
This was a train that thought the Miami turnpike was a way of life instead of a warning.

The Good
The character models when they are not breaking look pretty good. 
soundtrack is decent, a little too decent, makes me concerned about potential copyright issues.
The gameplay loop is actually decent. 

The middle ground
Room variety is too slim, makes memorization easy -> quick to get boring as well
Notes are ""translated"" into english the incorrect grammar and word choices make for some funny moments


The Bad.
Movement speed is atrociously slow. I was counting steps to pass time because movement is so bad.
Enemies dmg is weird. 3/4 girls take 5 hits to kill. 1 Girl is 2 hits, why its this way idk but it ends up feeling buggy vs design.

THE FUCKING SEX
-Camera out of focus
-Camera doesn't look at the important parts (as in the characters are in the middle of the room and the camera is pointed completely away from the scene giving a slight peek)
-no O
NPC's you pass are 2 Not quite T-Posing animations slamming against eachother with their asssests breaking.
- cocks look like poles
- Vaginas... what are those? we got smooth gap in a fucking H game!

THE GAME WILL NOT RUN PAST 30 FPS on Ultra graphics, If i can handle Hogwarts legacy, and Baulder's Gate 3 on Ultra, this game shouldn't stutter like a teretts kid during a funeral.
15 sec- freeze lag that CAN KILL YOU. (How i got the death Achievement)

- Took inspiration from Team Silent 1998 More fog= less graphics 

The story feels like it was written by a 15 year old... In the middle of their cringe phase. 

I wanted to like this game, but honestly it is so bad I wish I could report it as a scam. It is too raw and unfinished.

The ending I won't spoil, but man if thats all I get wow! nice black screen!

30091,this game blows. there's next to no content. unfinished game.,0
30092,"I successfully finished the main and bonus game in 6 hours. 
And hooray.......I did not encountered annoying or game-stopping bugs. 
The CE-edition of the game without the dlc plays as a normal complete game. There are no unfinishable games scenes or story lines.

This game was a good with an enjoyable, entertaining fantasy story.  It has a lot of puzzles. I love this... Although I do not like the arcade-based puzzles. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of logical based puzzles left to enjoy. 

The adventure part of the game was much improved, compared to the older Domino Games (Do Games Limites). They have listened to their players!!! 
- More logical actions. Little to no repetitive actions. For example : Items for inventory puzzles don‚Äôt need to be obtain again and again, but can be used multiple times during the game. 
- They also improved the puzzles for seasoned hog players. Now, the hard mode puzzles are really more difficult and has challenging puzzle-mechanisms compared to the easy mode, instead of just more time-consuming.
- The hidden object puzzles has now both easy and difficult items to find. I used the match-3 game options in these puzzles to find the too well hidden items instead of having to use hints üòâ

There are also things that has remained the same. 
The same achievements and easy to find collectables and morphs. 
Wallpapers, music and room to decorate with collected points of the collectables. 

There are 24 replay able hog and mini-puzzles, but only 20 of them are accessible. 
I assume you have to buy the dlc  to play for this.
",1
30093,"I powered through to the end, but it was boring.  There was no logic to things you needed to use to get past obstacles so it turned into ""try everything in inventory to see if something works"".  Don't waste your money.",0
30094,It's called Collectors Edition but you don't receive all available content,0
30095,DEVELOPER is to lazy to fix any bugs doesnt care about their games,0
30096,"have to admit i got frustrated at times, and i didn't like playing with checkpoints at all while still having to conserve lives. i had more fun with the ""restart from position"" option enabled. the game is really difficult, and the scoring doesn't feel very rewarding. thankfully, there is (probably an oversight which i kinda felt bad about exploiting but hey the game's hard enough and it doesn't work that well on 1.5 difficulty) a way to max out lives and score, simply by sticking to the back of the stage 1 boss and following it around (which will make your score skyrocket in the millions if you're patient enough, and in any case will dwarf any legitimate scoring from the stages). it also seems that scores aren't conserved between game starts, so if you close the game your scores will be gone. wasn't a big fan of that but it doesn't matter that much after all, especially with my previous points.

with the negatives out of the way......

the soundtrack is EXCELLENT, and i think the game looks awesome. i may have had some trouble following the action with the colors and sizes but overall it is very aesthetically pleasing. also the game is FREE?? and it's clearly a huge passion project, and i did have fun with the game overall and i was pleasantly surprised. for all the things i disliked, it's still a whole lot better than a fair bunch of shmups i've paid for on steam lol....
i'm mainly leaving this review to support the dev since i think the game is quite cool, and i hope they get to make more games in the future.

EDIT: i feel like my review sounds too negative on the gameplay side, i'm also going to mention that on one of my runs i randomly was sent into a secret stage with awesome music and i thought that was really cool, the game's handling feels pretty neat and the whole gameplay is quite tight. most of my negative feelings are also in part due to me not being THAT into more old-school shmups (i am a danmaku baby), and i'm not personally fond of mechanics that revolve around you spending a lot of time right next to enemies, at least not without bombs or other screen clearing effects. also the level layouts are very varied and the endgame was pretty hype with all the minibosses and stuff. just a cool game all around",1
30097,"As someone with 0 hours in this game and totally had no part in the soundtrack, this is absolutely incredible! P.S. the music slaps so hard.",1
30098,"The Rush is built with an awesome soundtrack, rage-bait level difficulty, and lots of hidden secrets + charm that give it so much appeal. It's a great game!",1
30099,"Not for scrubs like me, this is for people who REALLY hate themselves and like pain. So if that's you go nuts! Hard to argue with free and I can't say it's a bad game since it's clearly made with love but imho...

The weapon system has tons of options but none feel powerful and most are basically pea shooters or pea shooters in a different direction. Analog controls feel slippery but d-pad use doesn't feel as responsive as it should (but that could just be me). Suicide bullets from popcorn enemies moment one even on default difficulty, including powerup containers. Enemies can spawn in/move through/shoot through obstacles you can't, etc. The easiest part of stage 1 is the boss (by far) - so that'll tell you something (aka i don't get that kinda level design and pacing myself).

So I'm putting ""not recommended"" because chances are if you're reading this far you're probably not one of the chosen ones who this is for. But hey if you are, more power to you, sweet prince, you are braver than I. :)",0
30100,Man this game is too easy! Although I am confused why a lullaby played when I pressed start...,1
30101,"As someone who has seen this game a lot, it is definitely one of the best experiences of time. 
- Sun Tzu",1
30102,"Here are some tips for players, as well as strengths and growths for the game

Tips for players:
- Use WASD to move, k to bomb, l to shoot and enter to select in menu get settings/pause ( in the settings you can change to arrow keys to move, x to bomb, and z to shoot)
- Get all the collectables you can (they really help)
- Shoot all the enemies you can to reduce the count so it doesn‚Äôt get overwhelming EXCEPT for the non violent enemies that when you destroy release a bullet at you (Ex: the moving squares)
- You can destroy the flashing target seeking bullets but not any other kind of bullet
- If the game is too hard you could, change the difficulty, change it to start in last position vs checkpoint, or skip sections using the training mode in main menu


Strengths:

Top three strengths are:
         - The music is a Bop. It is really catchy which I don‚Äôt really think of as retro music being but I really have been enjoying the sound track. 4-5 star retro music.
         - This game isn‚Äôt just a retro themed game. It FEELS like a retro game. It IS a retro game. (at least from my experience of playing some retro arcade games). The aesthetics, the music, the AI and game design all combines into a game that could of been in the arcade room in the 70s or 80s (except with better music :) )
         - It is free, there is nothing that you have to pay to play this high quality retro game

There is accessibility in this game which allows for:
         -The difficulty can be changed from 0.5-1.5x the difficulty
         -Settings allows for starting at checkpoint or starting and last position (depending on who wants to play)
         -Settings allow for accessibility by changing the amount of starting lives (which I really like) in each game as well for left handed controls (the arrow keys instead of the awsd)
         -Training mode (allows you to explore more content without needing to stay alive from the beginning)

- Can clearly tell what symbols mean what (due to the key on the left) and you know what to shoot because all enemies are 
clearly red (you also know you can‚Äôt shoot asteroids since they are purple)
- A large variety of enemies are in the game which really makes the game play fresh and entertaining
- There are variety of bosses across the different stages which have amazing design
- This game was very engaging to me. I spent more time than I initially thought I would spend on this game
- I can resize my window to however I want it (I am really happy with this, I get annoyed when games automatically full screen the game)
-Haven't found any bugs from 40 minutes of playing
-The controls feel nice and are fluid

Growths:

- Especially on harder difficulties the purple comments are annoying and can come out of nowhere and kill you. I would like them to still be in the game, but maybe a warning sign could indicate the direction they are coming from or path they follow
- I know you can kill the target seeking bullets but I personally would want to be able to do damage to all types of bullets in the game (this might be hard to balance but it is just my preference)
- This game is just very hard. For me it takes to be on an easier difficulty and use start at position to even beat the first stage of the game. Yet this is not as big of a con as it could be because I am able to beat at least the first boss on a lower difficulty and can progress as far as I would compared to other retro games. It might even be a strength to have for some people who really likes challenging retro games.

Conclusion:

	In summary, if you are looking for an free entertaining side scrolling retro game that gives you a challenge, a wide range of different enemies to blow up, allows for a variety of player types (casual to hardcore), and that has stellar music and sounds ‚ÄúThe Rush‚Äù is a game for you.",1
30103,"I liked this game! Especially the unique graphics. I also love how accessible game settings are, like editing how much lives you got, and if you restart from a checkpoint or your last position, that's great for people with different preferences. Although I do think a continue option would be very beneficial for this game.",1

30113,"I really don't understand how this game can have ""Very Positive"" reviews. Prety short and predictable story, no rollback feature and iritating minigames. Only the lewd scenes are animated, and sure, you can see that they put a lot of work into it, but the rest is nothing to write home about. Give it a try if you're bored (and if it's on sale), but there are many other games that are graphically or story-wise far superior, and a better investment of your time and money.",0
30114,"I fell for it.

The reviews showed ""Very Positive"" and I tried to like this game. I bought it and tried it out. The navigation is wonky but each game has it's little quirks. The game's dialogue, however, was clearly not written or translated by someone who speaks fluent English.

I'm pretty forgiving about that, normally. You can give some latitude given that you are engaging in what is basically a digital adult picture book. If the pictures were good, it might have boosted my tolerance for the terrible writing.

In the end: this was not well done. I will be more careful, in the future to avoid this game developer....",0
30115,"The developer needs to improve.  This is another unfinished bug-ridden title.
I will admit, compared to their other titles, this one is LESS buggy, and does not seem to have a lot of translation mistakes and typo's.  So that's good.  But that does not mean that it is without serious bugs.
The biggest of these is the animation/cut-scenes.  Whenever you unlock or view a cut-scene, the first animation of the cut-scene becomes the master-file and blocks all other cut-scenes, so they only show up as black screen.  (ie. if you have a cutscene that has say, 5 animations in sequence.. you'll only actually be able to view the 1st, the rest will be blackscreen.)  .. The only resolution is to completely stop the game, and re-launch it, then  you can view 1 animation again.  and then you'll have to repeat and stop the game and re-launch it again, for any additional animations you want to see, for each one.  Otherwise, if you continue on the game without closing it and re-launching it, when you get to another scene, since it is holding the previous animation as master-file, it will go to black screen and lockup so you can't exit and have to alt+tab out and then close it from the outside and re-launch again anyway.  Really annoying.

To their benefit and credit, the developer did much better on this than on 3 of their other titles which were COMPLETE GARBAGE and a waste of money.   This title should be considered early access and needs a lot of improvement, but at least it's not as bad as the others.   I could see paying a low price for this one, but that having to re-launch for every single animation is just crazy stupid and annoying.   That is NOT how you leave a game for people to play.  

So, they did better than some of their others.  But is better than terrible good enough to recommend?  Not with the current bugs and lack of depth.  Game still needs much work.  At the very least it needs to be flagged as early access or beta, and they need to work on improving it.",0
30116,"Extremely short: finished in just over 2 hours. Too many minigames - and they're all the same. Non-skippable. Can't go back if you missed a line or made a bad choice, so save often. Only 3 models, none of which is like the game's thumbnail (neither in appearance nor in quality). Plays like a B-p0rn movie: from cold to ""sure lets do it in a public place with you"" in under 3 seconds.  Graphics: reasonably well. Some bad clipping. No climaxing, you just watch the same reps till you click ""x close"" and the story continues. Paid 6 for this game. Felt like should've been 2 or 3. I think the only redeeming factor is the washing machine scene, since it's an adult movie classic and I've not seem it before in a game.",0

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
My Lovely Stepsister is a Unity based visual novel, in a point and click adventure format.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Your stepsister, Tracy, who you haven't seen since she was 13, just went through a bad breakup with her boyfriend and has asked to move in with you.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start off by setting the main character's name, Leo by default. There is no way to roll back the text, or view the history.

After your first quest, buy a lasagna for your stepsister. Active quests show in the upper left of the screen. While the game may seem like you can go anywhere and do things, you are really limited to the quest. For example, if you don't have anything you need in the store, you can only go to the store, there is no additional interactions available.

Mini Games: After you get the lasagna, you have to come home and cook it. To find out about the objective of the mini game press the question mark on the game screen. The games are all very similar, but have different nuances. For the cooking mini game, there is a spinning wheel with green sections. You have to click in the green sections to successfully cook the lasagna. There is a progress bar on the right, you need to fill the bar. If you click outside of the green the bar goes down. The second mini game appears if you choose to peek on your stepsister in the shower. While it looks similar to the cooking game, it is different, you have to prevent the white ball from being hit by the black bars as they spin around the circle. Pressing the mouse button moves the track the ball is on. The difficulty of the mini games increases as the game goes on.

Money: As you walk around you'll see hot spots to search. Some of these spots will reward you with money. However, you can also work, on the laptop in your bedroom. Work is another mini game. You have to click in the highlighted area to increase the amount of money that you will earn. Money doesn't really play a large part in the game and a couple of hundred dollars (or whatever currency) is all you'll need.

Scenes: The scenes are comprised of short movies. On the sides of the screen are arrows. Clicking the arrows will show you a different video of the scene, a different angle or position. Close the scene by clicking close in the upper left. If you switch active windows the action, and audio, stop.

If the text box isn't on screen you can press the ESC button to bring up the option to Save, or Load.

While the English starts off very good, it falls off later in the game. There are a few oddities along the way. Day 1, after Tracy eats the lasagna she tells you the best neighbor she's ever had, so many better word choices available, brother, stepbrother, or roommate, for example. When you go to the University the it is shown as Univercity on the map.

There was an instance later in the game where all of the navigation arrows disappeared and I had no quest. I used the phone a couple of times and the navigation arrows came back. However, without a quest there was no way to continue the game, this caused me to be able to get all of the achievements, except the negative relationships, but none of the endings. This is a fatal flaw. I save and save often, so it is a flaw in the game logic as I reloaded my last save, after a restart, and had the same issue. I went to every location available, my home was not, and every phone contact. There was no way to continue the story.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are two Galleries, the CG Gallery for stills and the Video Gallery for, duh, videos. There are 40 stills and 42 videos. I was able to unlock all but six stills and three videos, which I assume have to do with the bad relationships or the different endings.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
There are supposed to be three different endings, unfortunately I'll never know as the game logic prevented me from getting any ending. The scene videos are excellent, but you'll never get closure.

Motherboard: Gigabyte X670E AORUS EXTREME (rev. 1x)

30118,"Wow. I know we have to deal with a lot of broken English when we play these types of games; seems to be what we are willing to trade for giving into our baser needs. 21 minutes was me being generous. The mini games don't tell you what to expect or what to do. You just kind of wing it. You only get a couple shots at it and then you fail. 

There appears to be no animations and the story isn't something that I was able to too accurately describe. You estranged step sister comes to town and expects you to buy a $50 lasagna, bish lasagna. Then for some reason some dude klepts your girls syllabus so you have to go get that. That's $30 and you have to do another mini game. It is basically a very similar mini game, but definitely not one I want to have to keep dealing with every couple minutes. Its not a good mechanic and not well planned game play. 

21 minutes and I am completely unsatisfied. The only difference between me and this game are, I don't need 21 minutes to get someone to figure out it's not worth it.",0
30119,This is a linear visual novel. It has mini-games. Three endings. It does have bugs in it especially on day 8 which seems to be well known and old. I am kind of split on whether this one was good or bad because of the day 8 bug makes me so mad on a few attempts. I wouldn't say this one is that easy to complete the achievements.,1
30120,"It's not that bad a game, but it's not worth that much money... It doesn't have any [b]animations[/b], just video. There is a game in which there is not only video, but also [b]animations[/b]!",1
30121,The game is so short that it should be $2.00. Too quick and not enjoyable. The story makes little sense and the sex is forgettable.,0
30122,"Really crap game. Save system totally sucks - you can only save at seemingly arbitrary times, and never before the super sucky minigames, which seem to happen constantly. Not remotely my idea of fun.",0

30126,"Not a bad porn game.  But, definitely not worth 10$ or even when on sale for 50%, not enough content to keep yourself busy,  i like longer content. Story is very forgettable and bland. Buy it if you want but i doubt you'll like it

The videos are good quality and that's it, there is nothing else going on. Also videos are one scene from different angles, no climax, just the same scene. I tried playing but I lost interest after about 5 min, played 30 min total and will try to get refund before uninstalling. Not sure who the target audience is, definitely not Adults. It can be improved with some voices and more interactions but it looks like they just want to capitalise on video quality without content, quick money grab.",0

Nightstands are those tables next to the bed--you use them primarily at night. Hence the term ""nightstand."" They are not found in the kitchen--those are called ""cabinets."" They hold things like food, or pots and pans. 
The choices are there, but they have no consequences. Some jackass wants to trade me a beer for a girl's notebook. I chose ""That's ridiculous!"" (which means ""no deal"") but guess what? I still have to buy him a beer. I have no money, so I have to go home to ""work"" which is the most boring minigame ever invented. That's when I called time of death on this POS. 
The writing is obviously ELL (English Language Learner) and if you want to learn English, that's a fine and noble quest. Go take a class or ten. Charging me money to look at a bunch of fat girls, jump through ridiculous hoops, while enduring a mind-numbing story line as you try to learn English? Not gonna happen. I'm requesting a refund, but I might not get it. I've lost my patience with bad devs and have been requesting a lot of them lately.
It's $6. It's not about the money. It's the point. Stop buying these sh*tty games and they will stop making them. Force them to raise their standards, so they will produce a product that's actually worth the price of a Happy Ending. This one isn't worth the price of a Happy Meal.",0

30164,"Absolutely the worst indie horror game I have played this year.

The game plays at around 18-23 FPS on a 2060. Zero graphics settings, not even a menu.

The game is 5 minutes long if you die.

All of the doors are broken, the house is populated with the bare minimum of stock assets (and not even the right ones, this guy has an industrial fridge and a foodservice sink in his kitchen. The downstairs bathroom also has a port-a-potty door with no handle.)

All of the other houses on the street are empty shells, and the ""store"" is a featureless cube with an elevator for a front door.

You don't interact with anything; you move near it and your character ""jumps"" into a new position as the game loads into a changed state.

The antagonist is literally staring out the window at you when you get home, but the main character is apparently too utterly blind to notice this even though you can stand and stare straight at him.

There is one jumpscare; but you have to manually trigger it by entering the room with the antagonist.

After you go back to bed and wake up, you hear the sound of a crash from downstairs. But there's nothing breakable at all downstairs other than the TV which hasn't moved; and if you enter the room upstairs that the antagonist was in, he's still there and the jumpscare sends you back to the point after you left the store.

The police station is... down the road somewhere I guess? I looked away for a literal second while walking along the sidewalk, and when I looked back, I was in the police station.

And then the game ends with a line of text that just says that the police told you that the guy from the store had a knife and went to your house to wait for you. Nothing else.",0

This current condition of release is hard to use nor enjoy.  The graphics fall in the mid-range, instructions and tooltips are noticeably absent, no control shortcuts, a limited selection of furniture, and an overall dearth of customization options. Comparable applications are readily available on platforms such as Windows or the Apple Store, offering a more refined user experience if you are intent to do interior design. I sincerely hope that Gamker will fulfill their commitment to enhancing this game/application continuously, even if the purpose of the release is to prioritize quick financial gain.  Purchase this game if you are supporting Gamker, but don't buy it if you want to play/use it.",0

Unfortunately the game does not run properly. The loading screen freezes and skips for several minutes and when it finally loads and you try and start a new room it freezes up constantly. I couldn't get past 10 minutes of the game and never got to even see what the game is like. Hopefully this will not be an issue once the game is out of early access and I will purchase it again if it changes. I love the idea and I hope the devs fix the game to be playable!",0

 You can take screenshots, record a 360 turntable animation, and share it with others or on social media. I hope they can add more powerful graphic features like Raytracing and PBR material in the future. But even the game at its state worth the money =)

Unless it just looks awful from the jump, my co-op partner and I try most free cooperative games that release on Steam. [b]Embers[/b] seemed interesting enough - sort of a fantasy top-down shooter, featuring dragons. Although some of the reviews criticized the game's control scheme, we both used controllers and found the game to control fine. We played enough to retrieve one of the dragon eggs, but after we were defeated we didn't feel the urge to try again. The game is a little rough around the edges, from the inadequately signposted shrine where players can purchase skills to the ludicrous purple bat swarm that covers the whole screen and seems to take about 30 seconds to put down. For reference, this is much, much more time than any other enemy we faced.

If you're looking for a fun, free top-down shooter to play with a friend, I'd recommend SAS: Zombie Assault 4 instead.",0
30219,"Misleading. It's tagged with partial controller support despite being nonfunctional on mouse and keyboard and only functional on controller. This causes the game to be advertised to mouse and keyboard audiences and controller audiences despite it only being available on the latter.

30233,Great game for mind refreshment and if you want to take a break from shooting games like CS and COD.,1
30234,Loved the retro art style of this game and had a very fun time playing it. At times it was rough ( because I'm not the greatest at platformers ) But all and all I really enjoyed this game.,1

30240,Really enjoyed the game. A simple yet amazing experience that mixes farming and spaceship shooting. Really like the way the upgrades work and the builds you can create. Very nice!,1
30241,Really cute and awesome game! Also quite challenging to master and succeed against the enemies!,1
30242,"as a big fan of grp i wanted to give this game a chance as it's what you wanted to make as a successor of grp. The points that are to improve : 
1- reloading bug : sometimes we cant reloadweapon/melee attack/change weapon, it just gets stuck and doesn't work
2- disconnecting : sometimes i get disconnected from a server without any reason ( a kick that no one asked for )
3- the moves still slow and there is a lack of dynamisme between the moves
4- we cant climb all the climbable places 

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING AND I WISH YOU WILL RECREATE THE GAME SUCCESSFULLY. YOURE THE BEST COMMUNITY EVER

30243,"The game ‚ÄúShadows of Soldiers‚Äù is great, after so long it‚Äôs finally a worthy successor to ‚ÄúGhost Recon Phantoms‚Äù. The gameplay is reminiscent of old times and the new maps are breathtaking. It's so much fun to slide or cover, as well as lie on your stomach and turn left or right. Being able to constantly change the view over the left or right shoulder is also extremely helpful. All in all, this game is on the right track and needs all the support we as gamers can give. It's amazing that a small crew of developers managed to do all this, considering that at the end of every game hundreds of developers, map and character designers, musicians and artists are mentioned in the credits. 100 out of 100 points from me, keep it up, Playtests 2 is really fun and I'm looking forward to buying the final game.",1

I understand that  Ã∂RÃ∂eÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂bÃ∂ Vert's was renamed due to Mattel not trademarking it, but it still feels a little weird seeing that name. Environment is top notch and I love the little easter eggs hidden around. Overall this expansion is well worth $10 even if you are not an Acceleracers fan. Please support this to show Mattel us fans are still here and have interest in this IP.",1
30246,I still can not believe this is an ACTUAL AcceleRacers EXPANSION; not just some cars which are cool nontheless but honestly i dreamed of this for such a long time jesus thank you for this so much,1
30247,"I love you Milestone and Mattel for not forgetting about the AcceleRacers fandom.

Chicane, Spine Buster, Rat-ified and [strike]Vert's[/strike] Reverb are great additions to the game and are faithful to their toy versions (I used to have Reverb myself). The Acceledrome is a fairly faithful recreation of what we saw in the movies back then and it still holds a special place in my heart. 

However there is one thing that is bothering me. In Hot Wheels Unleashed 1, the Expansion DLCs have at least one Track Module related to their respective expansion and the AcceleRacers DLC gets... none. It's mildly disappointing that no new modules are introduced, would have loved to see the Swamp Realm Monster again. Is it going to peg it down to me giving it a thumbs down? No, 10 bucks for 4 highly-popular cars and an Environment is fair.",1
30248,"They recreated everything pretty well. I love the detail they put into the new environment. This expansion gave me tons of nostalgia, and i could recognize pretty much everything, especially the references they used for the course names.

Thank you, Milestone for making my childhood dreams come to life in this expansion.",1
30249,"Even if you're not into Acceleracers, this is worth it. The enviroment is great, the new cars are great, the icons are great, pretty much this is great.",1
30250,New map is great. Seeing AcceleRacers again after so long is wild. For $10 I'd say this is an excellent DLC. I just have one issue in that the ultimate time trial is unbeatable right now. With a time of 1:01 as the goal on a map that takes around 2 minutes to finish there just aren't any shortcuts that would make a time like that possible. Hopefully it gets patched soon,1
30251,"Cars and level are great! Though Reverb being renamed ""Vert's"" was an interesting choice....",1
30252,"wish the campaign map was bigger and it had realms but this is really well done, its not just some low quality room that was made to crash grab off fans stuff like the wheel of power in the middle is given nice detail and lightning. i had given up hope that this would happen but it did and its not crap. for $10 i say its worth more then most car games dlc and if your like me and grow up watching the movies then this is amazing.",1
30253,"Although I wish they added some of the classic sound effects from the movies (The Wheel of Power doesnt feel the same being so silent. And the old Nitrox would've been so amazing as a boost sound, and more interactive elements like the realm alarm system would've been cool), the amount of detail that has been added in the Acceledrome is pretty amazing. 
Being able to explore the Acceledrome in full 3D is a dream come true ever since I first saw the movies as a kid. And having even more Acceleracer cars added is always a plus!",1
30254,"As an owner of all these cars in real life, they are extremely well detailed and faithfully modeled to the real diecasts; even down to the community-adorned ""ukeT"" decal that appears on Chicane's livery in real life. The people reviewing/buying this DLC are Acceleracers/HW35 superfans, but I'm happy to report that this expansion is in-depth in terms of content too. The cars are the standout point for this DLC, but the AcceleDrome map is grandiose in scale and has the Wheel of Power boasting its gorgeous glow in the center of the map. The Acceleracers expansion comes with a mini-roadmap of events to do, just like the regular campaign. It also includes some profile stuff (profile pictures, card backgrounds, etc) for both Teku and Metal Maniac fans (no Silencerz or Racing Drones unfortunately). The events have famous quotes from the movies in their descriptions that pay homage to the franchise in a quirky and loving way too. This DLC expansion is absolutely worth the $9.99 in my opinion, but I'm certainly biased and should acknowledge that. My only gripe comes down to the fact that Reverb is renamed to ""Vert's"" in this game, which grammatically confuses me, and makes me groan as a pedantic Acceleracers superfan. They officially confirmed this is due to legal reasons, and thankfully the model remains accurate to the movie and IRL diecast anyways, so it's absolutely forgivable. 

This DLC is meant for the vocal minority of dedicated Acceleracers/HW35 fans who have been asking for new content over the past two decades, but I do think this DLC holds its value even despite that. Huge props to the developers and team behind this game for making it happen!",1

30262,"(EDIT: I really like this game, the scenes are cool (but dark) the music is really pretty and chill and I am slowly working my way through the levels, but I REALLY wish there was a hint system!).

I need a ""Caution"" Like for this game. I love the premise but am having difficulties right off the bat. Level one has a list of objects to find. The scene is 3D and you can spin it and zoom in and out. The problems I'm having are: The scene is really dark so it's hard to see at times (for me). Finding the objects is more of a puzzle with lots of clicking to see which things are interactive. Did I mention lots of random clicking? Anyway, I found all but the last 5 items but was absolutely stuck. There isn't a hint system so I finally used escape and left the game, hoping to check the discussions for help. The game is still too new for comments I guess, so I went back to see if I could find the last items. Guess what? No save system. I guess so I have to start all over. :(  I think this game has a lot of promise so I'm not asking for a refund--I'm going to wait and hope those more clever than I will post tips...OR that the developer can add a hint system or something? I'll be hopefully waiting...",1
30263,"A very short hidden object game with really bad camera. Get it only at a huge discount.

The aim of the game is to select items from a list. There are only six little locations that may be finished in a few minutes, so you won't need much time to complete this. 

Stages are miniature, nicely detailed dioramas. Sadly, due to a camera that is fixed in the middle of the screen, the most of it will be overlooked. Despite being able to spin around, the camera cannot be moved around or rotated up and down. Since they are not transparent, you cannot see through walls to the other side. Zooming in and out is another pointless feature because it works only in the middle of the screen. 

As a result, finding stuff becomes incredibly challenging because you are unable to get a closer look. This may be possible in some stages if you click the magnifying glass symbol, but it only applies to certain areas, such as a drawer. This forces you to click at every tiny suspicious thing and hope it‚Äôs one of the items on the list.

Stages are not very interactive. The most you see are little objects that can be pushed around. This can create a problem because you might push something over an item and not even see it. However, clicking on everything is encouraged because you never know where you might find what you're looking for.",0
30264,The vision of what this game could be is brilliant and i liked the way you could rotate and zoom in a little bit. Aside from that it falls short of what the game could be. The lighting sucks big time and i found myself clicking in dark areas hoping to come across one of the objects. I spent a lot of time just clicking blindly due to the terrible lighting. The camera functionality still needs some work too.,0
30265,"Very rough, but still enjoyable and some good mechanics for a hidden object game.

Had fun. More levels please. Thanks.",1
30266,"A fun and relaxing little game to pass some time. The levels are very well made and nice to look at. I see more levels are being added for free, which is pretty cool. 

My main critique is that it's sometimes hard to see some of the items, but I guess that's the point of the game, so anyway.

Worth the cheap price if you like these kind of ""Hidden item"" games",1

30268,"This game has potential to be a good backrooms game however there are many bugs that need to be fixed in order for it to be playable experience. I am giving this game a thumbs up since it has only just released and I feel like it get better with some fixes and tweaks to certain levels. I played with 2 friends and the experience was decent however there are some issues which I will list below.

1. The parkour level (level 7) is way too difficult especially for people who are not the host since you just clip through the platforms. I noticed that when you get to the lava spiral, the bottom few platforms prevent you from jumping half of the time and it is quite annoying (especially with how weird the jump mechanic is).

2. Level 8 is completely broken as I mentioned in the discussion that I posted and I just end up dying from sanity. Myself and my friend looked everywhere to try and find what we were suppose to do but we didn't find anything which leads me to believe that the level is bugged (in multiplayer at least). 

Other than these 2 major issues, I feel like the game is quite fun and is reasonably priced for the experience. I will also note that I did get a cheevo that was suppose to be given on level 10 randomly on level 8 while running on the road.",1

30272,"As much as I want to give this indie developer a positive review and a recommend here, I can't do that if I'm being genuine and honest about the game state itself.  It's simply not worth the price with the performance issues, lack of basic sound effects, and game breaking bugs I've witnessed just on level 1 alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGPQ2uNn2ko

The problems I experienced preventing my recommend of this game:

- When playing with friends co-op and you die and start spectating, you see 100x more sway that whoever you are spectating, making for an almost miserable spectating experience.  Ugh.  Fix this ASAP!

- When searching level one, one part of the level tanked my in game FPS to less than 10 fps, where other areas of the map I was getting over 70 fps.  I don't know what is causing this massive performance drop, but this is another major reason that I cannot recommend this game in its current state.  This is game breaking, especially if you're in a chase.. it absolutely DESTROYS the immersion and fun!  (I show this clearly in the video review)

- This game is missing basic sound effects that you'd expect in a game of this type.  No foot step sounds, no basic clicks and clanks when collecting or using items etc.  Adding tension music when in danger would also add a LOT to this game, and it's simply missing.  This isn't game breaking,  but it definitely hurts the overall experience.

- No UI to see the status of other players when playing co-op.  Why cant we not see the health and thirst levels of our friends in a small UI somewhere?  Again, this isn't game breaking, but why TF isn't this in the game?!?

I DO love that this developer has created completely unique puzzles and levels for this game that I have not seen in any of the other Backrooms games.  Do understand that because of this alone, I REALLY want to give this game a recommend and support this game and developer.  But I'd be dishonest to the developer if I recommended it with the massive game breaking problems that I've already experienced, and that's just one the first level. ..I can only imagine how many more game breaking problems there likely is on all the other 9 levels.

Dev.. *pats you on the back*.  I LOVE what you are trying to do here and I LOVE the potential here but you GOT to do a lot more work on this game to make it all that it truly can and deserves to be!  Get to it man, you have my support!  ..I'll be happy to re-review this game if you address the problems I've noted above.


NOT RECOMMENDED... even though it breaks my heart to do it.  It just needs some more work and I hope this developer or developer(s) get it all fixed up because this could be a HELLA FUN little indie game once it's in a better state.",0

[h2]The Entrepreneur Review[/h2]

[h1]Father‚Äôs Bar[/h1]
During your life, your father was the closest thing to you, as your mother passed away during your birth. But that did not put your dad in a sad mood, no. He was filled with joy at getting you and has been with you ever since.
Until now, two years apart, because you followed your dream and went to study law school, and now you are in need of returning upon your father‚Äôs death.
Take over his bar and fix it up. Keep it in good shape, keep his dream live on, and while you're at it, see what will happen with your lust life.
Good luck.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Just because the story is so long, I thought I‚Äôd first talk a little about the first characters that the player will meet (aka, roomies, and best friends).
 
First, your old best friend, whom you had to leave when you traveled away to law school. Her name is Lucy, and you two have been inseparable since kindergarten. Your dad was like her own father as well, her second father.
She got depressed when you left, and she didn‚Äôt like anything about herself. But once you got back and she noticed you in the bar after seeing the note ‚ÄúFor Hiring‚Äù she got overflown with joy. And soon later got hired by you.
 
Second, your roommates.
Valentine, Alexa, and Laura. These three beautiful women, who all live under the same roof.
Valentine, Facegrammer some sort of social media. She is very famous and very self-aware of her private life after what happened in her past.
Alexa, Collage girl who‚Äôs learning to become an actor. She is very shy but hides it with her acting, but with the help of you, she is growing braver.
Laura, Divorced women who‚Äôs working as a hairdresser. She‚Äôs the one who interviews new potential roommates and manages most things around the house.
 
Then there are, of course, more women, but that comes later in the game. I‚Äôve played the game for 3,8 hours, and these four are the main side characters.
There is Elena, who is a fellow student at Alexa‚Äôs school. We hate her, and she gets turned on by getting rejected. She is the first of them all who is willing to please you.
 
The game begins with the player sitting down in front of one of the characters, Valentine. The devs favorite character, in his opinion,.
And giving us some information about the dev who made this game. Kind of making him sound bigger and better than what he is, but it only makes it a bit funny.
 
The story is that your father has passed away, and his last wish was for you to keep his dream (the bar) alive. And as you get back, you will move into a house with three roommates, all girls, who will make your life a bit more spicy.
While hanging out with each other, a new adventure will happen, and even more people will be introduced.
Working on the bar during the mornings with your new employee and hanging out with the girls during the rest of the day.
 
The rest of the story is about where you need to go and explore yourself. If I were to finish the whole game, well, then I would maybe be 24 hours plus in.
So try this game out, as it‚Äôs a very good price and a very long, interesting story with a lot of content. I bet you won‚Äôt get bored from this, or maybe from all the reading.

[h1]Visual & Audio[/h1]
[b]Visuals[/b]
The graphics and its textures look good, but the dev might over praise his own work. Either way, the animations are smooth and clean, and the visuals have small or even fun details in the background or specific objects.
For example, in some scenes, the player will see people or animals in the background of the main character chatting with someone. And during scene switches/next text, the object(s) or people can have moved, or something is happening to them.
So even if the main character is doing their business, the world around them is doing stuff as well, not simply standing still in one position in all the dialog scenes with the main character and his friends.

[b]Audio[/b]
The Entrepreneur has a large variety of music selections. So for some scenes, there will be one music theme and a song. And when a new scene/chapter begins, either a new song will play or there will be silence for a few scenes.
It's hard to explain, but the music is wonderful.
 
The dev have also thought through and put together the most fitting songs for the fitting moments/scenes.
If the song finishes playing before the scenes are complete, then it will restart the song from the beginning and play it up again.

[h1]My final little thoughts[/h1]
I have played this game so far for 3,8 hours, and I have only unlocked 2 achievements out of 25, so I can clearly say that this game has a good amount of content, story, and gameplay.
 
And as for how much I‚Äôve played the game so far, I truly enjoy it, and I highly recommend it. And for such a price, with this amount of content and gameplay, I am having a hard time finding cons to it.
One small con that I could add, which isn‚Äôt big at all, is the spelling. The dev will also inform the player at the start of the game that there might be a few spelling errors in the game, and he does apologize for them.

Rating: 9/10

30278,"[b]Tl;dr:[/b] It's a good game but not quite as good as Leap of Faith as some others are saying. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

+ Good looking characters
+ Story was interesting enough
+ I liked the non-sexual animations
+ Overall good renders
+ Good range of humor
+ Fun easter eggs here and there
+ Non-harem made it hard to choose a girl but also kept it interesting
+ It's a complete game; no seasons to wait for

[b]Cons:[/b]

- There are plot holes
- I didn't care for the soundtrack
- The ending isn't very satisfying
- Sexual animations were a little rough
- Minor poke-through in a few renders

[b]Closing thoughts:[/b]

I saw a lot of praise for this game in the reviews, many of them saying it was on par with Leap of Faith but I disagree. It's a good game in its own right but the writing and characters weren't as strong as LoF. I only got one ending but it seems like they're all basically montages of whatever girl you end up with. It didn't particularly feel satisfying. All in all I liked it enough to be willing to check out other games by this developer.
",1
30279,"A note I think will matter to people who are looking at this VN:
The sexual scenes are brief and you'll mostly only get a few nude shots until toward the end of the game. (it's ~10 hours long for a single play through)

--
It starts with a message from the dev that this is his first game, which is honestly surprising given the overall quality.

There were a handful of renders or animations which had something like slight model clipping or a couple times I saw a head moving at a weird angle but otherwise they're all very high quality, realistic and polished.

The story is strong too, I was invested, surprised and satisfied from start to finish. The writing could use some polish, a few typos, but it flowed nicely so I didn't get stuck on them.

I feel like I'm nit picking to point out those flaws because otherwise it's a solid 10/10, I'm going to keep an eye for future things from the dev.",1
30280,"This is a top tier romantic v.n. it has flirting and romance and sex and a great plot. If you only care about the sex item in my list then you should get ""Fresh Women."" But if you like Being a D.I.K. or ""Love of Magic"" or ""City of Broken Dreamers"" then this is the v.n. for you. Great plot and nice twists. It is a lot like ""Acting Lessons"" but not as dark.",1
30281,"It's good, don't need much of a discount for it to be a very worthwhile purchase. There are a couple of negatives, part of the story is a little too ridiculous to be believable, and the expressions female characters make when they are exasperated, well they scrunch their faces up like a pouting child, that seems to break the immersion somewhat. For an adult AVN, the pacing leans a little too far towards the N,  and often goes too long without the A part. 
Having got all of that out of the way, most of the story is solid for an AVN, the adult stuff is good quality, the main characters are developed well, and choices absolutely matter, you can get 3 good playthroughs out of this, and it does have the skip function working unlike some games so when you go back it will go much quicker. 
You know, now that I think about it some more, it is worth getting this at full price, much better value than most of the other options out there",1
30282,"First of all this is one of the most engaging games I have played in a while. It ranks up there with two giants. Leap of Faith and Chasing Sunsets.  The story is very exciting and full of suspense. One of the things that really stood out are the renders of the girls. My god they are beautiful all most life like. I found myself staring at them during game play, taking in there features, the bodies are well proportioned. Also the background was very unique, you could see things happening in the background while the MC engaged in conversation. The sex scenes were tasteful and erotic. All in all a game you must have. Finishes the first play thru which was a lot of time for the price, 10 hours to be exact. Going back for other play thru's. om a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this game a 9.",1
30283,"Quite possibly one of the top-five visual novels I've ever played. There are some things it doesn't do perfectly. In my playthrough, I decided on my path within the first 30 minutes, but the game kept giving me chances to change my mind for several hours. Some people might like that flexibility, though, so I can't hold that against it. I played through the story in just a couple of sessions, and I think that says more about the game than any of the small gripes I had. People who prefer their AVNs to be non-stop sex-em-ups might see it differently, but for me, this game ranks up there with the likes of Artemis and Acting Lessons. If you liked those, I think this is easily worth your time.",1
30284,"Okay just finished play-through  for the first time...(I play too many of these games and have no life....I know I admit it) and had to do a review right away. It's a pretty awesome story, great renders and animations, my compliments to the creators of this top notch avn. If your just looking for fapping material it may be a bit slow for you, but if you appreciate quality and miss titles like ""leap of faith"" or ""acting lessons"" this one will  fill the void.",1
30285,"Really good VN.

Not too long, not too short, just the right length I would say.

I really enjoyed the story and the characters. It has some really good music as well.

Another big plus is that its a complete story with ending so no need to wait for years for other seasons to see the end.

Renders are all high quality and really good.

I would say its weakest point are the animations, some are better than others but its nowhere near the high quality animations that some other games have. Not a huge problem though.

All in all its a great VN and I highly recommend it.",1
30286,"The Entrepreneur is an alright AVN. The story was engaging got me hooked, Stunning renders. Multiple routes to go for will take a decent amount of time to get em ( i guess it also depends on how fast you go through them :D ).

The downside? Music choices could be better. Lack of sex scenes but for me it's alright the story makes up for it but I was really expecting more and I wish the endings had more to it (short epilogues perhaps?) rather than a compilation of renders of the girl that you ended up with.

For the price that they offered its definitely worth it. You guys should really give this AVN a shot.",1
30287,"As far as AVNs go, this is a pretty good one. It's basically Leap of Faith Lite (not as sad or deep, but a good story with strong characters). I have two primary criticisms. One is that the scenes are, as mentioned elsewhere, fairly short. The players go from 0 to 60 real fast and don't last long. They are, in contrast to some other AVNs, in service to the story rather than the reason the story exists. The second problem I had, and this was the larger one by far, is the final (of 4) episodes. The pacing is horrendous, it drags out forever, and the whole thing becomes this convoluted twisty thriller thing that just doesn't fit with the rest of the game. It's not *bad*, but it's frustrating to get through the first time. 

One thing I noticed here, and I had this same thing with College Kings, is that it seems like the game drives you toward a certain love interest. Like, you can reject her multiple times and still have a shot. 

Finally, Lucy = best girl.",1
30288,"Good game: likable, realistic characters, interesting plot, good writing (some grammatical errors that will no doubt at some point be addressed).  It is a complete game, so no waiting for future seasons and it leaves you looking forward to the developers future work.",1
30289,"Very french story, very slow-witted protagonist. But likable pretty girls helps a lot.

30292,Good story. Great ladies to choose from. Took about 7 hours for one play through. Like the fact that the story is complete so you won't have to wait years for the developer to finish unlike so many other AVN's out there. Maybe not a fan of the fact that what ending you get is not completely clear because there is no this is the moment to choose who you end up with. Instead the ending is determined by a series of choices so if you to unlock all the endings most likely need to use a guide. Overall a very good game. Just know that while the story is very good the adult scenes are very limited. If you play AVN's and skip the dialogue just to get to the adult scenes this game is not for you.,1
30293,"I liked this very much. It's quite short compared to most of visual novels out there but it tells you the story without dragging it on. The renders are very beautiful, songs match the scenes and the characters are likable. 

My only complaint is that I would've liked the endings to be a little more expanded with epilogues instead of slideshows of few pictures though.  Being a short story there aren't much choices overall but in the end it is worth  the price and the experience.",1
30294,Very good story that kept me intrigued. Not as many sex scenes as many other games like this but they were excellent. 10 hours of game play to get to an ending.,1
30295,"i thought this was an excellent game...it was a complete game: good plot, nice ladies, really good story",1
30296,"Feels worth the price. Was a long game atleast in my mind. The story branches were detailed and well thought out. Overall, I really enjoyed to see how it ended. Animations were pretty decent, sotry made you feel connected like your choices mattered.",1
30297,"Story maybe good but if you're in for the action the scene are scarce, short and too much clicking.",0
30298,"The visuals of this game are fantastic.. the animations are brilliant.   This is a story with adult components and not just a porn game.  If you are going to blaze through this game to the ""good parts"", you may want to pass.  If you want an engaging story with some adult content, this is a refined option.   Good first game.",1
30299,"A nice solid little game that's fully complete, unlike most visual novels on Steam.

On first impression, this game has a very bland setting. The conflict in the story isn't anything better either, as the moment it begins, you can already see how it will all play out, which isn't disproven by the climax. A lot of the initial dialogue is also structured as if it was written for a school PSA, where everybody has to constantly reassure each other of every minute thing, something that doesn't play out in real conversations. Most of this is fixed in the middle arc, but there is still one too many scenes where characters are reminiscing events that have already been beaten into your head. 

If you can put up with the story babying you often, you can greatly enjoy one of its biggest strengths, which is its vibrant choices. Most of the decisions you have to make are tough, and their results become very rewarding because you properly see the effects they almost always cause. Once you get past the introductions, the game also starts to provide numerous new story angles, all with fun scene rewards and new NPCs. These two things pretty much save and make the game.

The art quality is decent too, and I'm glad to report that the animations are smooth. This game goes even a step beyond what most VN do and provides numerous B-roll cutscenes, but the final adult gallery count is a bit on the short side. You can only pursue 4 characters in the game, but even these four only get a total of maybe two scenes. You're going to be doing more reading than partaking for the final chapter because all the steam will have run out by this point.

This game should have been more bold. When I realized that there wasn't going to be anything more after the second scene for each main NPC, I didn't bother to read how everything concluded. The last chapter unnecessarily spends wrapping elements up that were already well resolved, and none of the cast has anything left to explore. There should have been more variety of tragedy and turmoil in the first few arcs for me to be invested in how the main conflict resolves. Had the game just made it so that the last chapter was me hanging out with the NPCs in my route of choice, providing one innovative scene after another, it would have been much more impactful than what it went with.",1
30300,"ok i admit i have not played too much of this yet, I have only played around 45 mins, however I can usually tell within the first 10 minutes, if these types of game will keep my interest or not, and I must say this game has me gripped, the characters look great especially Lucy, and the story so far seems good, it isn't a boring college frat story, so that is a bonus. the only downside i have with this game is the introduction, i find those types of introductions cringe, and a waste of time, but once you get past that, the game itself is great, I can not wait to play more of this game, but just from the short time I have played it, I can safely say, I can recommend this game.",1
30301,"Well this was different from other AVNs. I really enjoyed the story, renders and models as well as a number of SFW animations which made the story more alive.
The models were great too.
Only one minus point is that I feel the ending was wrapped up quite quickly.

All-in-all, please pick up this title.

30302,Beautiful women to romance in a story rich game. It is a romance game with multiple scenes and endings with each of the Main Girls. Enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to the next project.,1
30303,Good progressive story and graphics. Music is great too.,1
30304,"well damn this is one of the few times I was interested in the story more than the porn scenes 

10/10 story 
10/10 porn scenes 
10/10 choices they had me sitting there thinking about what to pick",1
30305,"One of the best looking AVN's going, decent storyline and alternative paths to unlock different content.

It is a little short but the positives outweigh the negatives",1
30306,"This is my first time posting a review on here, but I felt this game deserved to be my first one. The Entrepreneur is one of the best visual novels that I've played for a while, and I can really only think of positive things to say about it. 

Firstly, it's a complete game unlike a lot of a AVN that are out at the moment. I'm not quite at the end of the game yet but I don't think I'm far off and I'm at just over 4 hours. I reckon by the time I'm done that my first playthrough will be around 5 hours. But, I know there will be replay value because there'll be other girls paths to take. So the game length and replayability is decent. Not the longest game, but for under ¬£10 I think you'll get your money's worth.

Now, onto the meat of the game - the story is great and that's important for a Visual Novel. Yes, the sex scenes are important - let's not kid ourselves here - but I've asked for refunds on games where the story or characters fall down. But, thankfuly, without giving away spoilers, the story is compelling with it's fair share of drama, emotion and suspense, plus you have great characters that you care for. Plus, the Main Character isn't a massive douchcanoe unlike a lot of AVNs and that is SO important because, again, I've returned games where the Main Character isn't enjoyable to play. So, a strong story and strong characters really make this a  joy to play. Plus, the writing is good and even though the developer apologies for English not being his first language (he's French, IIRC) it doesn't impact the writing or the story. I've played VNs where the English translations are really poor and the script feels quite stilted and unnatural and it does spoil my enjoyment of the game. But, there's no such issue here. It's a great story, with strong characters, and it feels like my choices are making a difference.

There's a good variety of girls in the game and they're all very well presented and the ones that are love interests are all likeable and fun in their different ways. It's a difficult choice to decide which route to take because they're all great characters and all very attractive. At the moment, I'm going with Lucy because she's gorgeous, funny and fiesty. There are also fun and hot side girls who you can hook up with as well, but doing so might impact your chances with some of the main interests. But you're very well covered when it comes to attractive and compelling girls in this game. The animations are not the best i've seen in an Visual Novel but they are very good and well done. I think, looking at the gallery, I would've liked a couple more scenes with each girl. But, with the length and price of the game I'm not going to complain about it. You're getting a full VN with great story and characters for less than a tenner here and that's a rare thing these days.

Honestly, any criticisms I could level at the game are going to be ntipicking and all in all The Entrepeneur is a fantastic Visual Novel that deserves more attention. I'd definitely put it in my Top 10 Visual Novels that I've played. Heck, maybe even Top 5 depending on how the game finishes up. It's refreshing to play through a whole game and have one that is well-written and genuinely makes you want to keep playing and not skip any of it just to get to the sex stuff. Honestly, massive well done to MisterMaya for producing a great game. If you haven't already, pick it up because I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1
30307,"Chris from College Kings is now Lucas, so some re-used character models. Also I would say that story and characters are bit boring, so after just one route I'm uninstalling this and move to better games.",0
30308,"Pretty solid.

Pros
-Music + Animations.
-Story line ... mostly believable. 
-Characters act accordingly and don't break doing unrealistic things for themselves.
-Multiple storylines worth a few playthroughs. 
-You get a sweet and amazing cat
-Alexa / Val

Cons
-Sometimes the music isn't the best chosen for a scene
-Unlocking the gallery can be a bit of a pain
-The first 10 minutes of the story is ... hyper unrealistic (it gets far better after that)
-Animation speeds may vary.

This game was pretty solid, not great not bad but good. The first 10 minutes of the story was like .. ok yeah sure ... that's definitely what would happen *sigh*. After that though the character interactions are pretty darn good, and the overall premise holds together nicely. 

I would lean more to getting this one on sale 6.75/10

Also ... during what I would say is the best scene with the best animations in the game, there is a ... wardrobe issue. Where the clothes are on .. than off .. but than on again as a different outfit ... than off again with slightly different outfit ... it was ... kinda offputting.",1
30309,"The game was interesting, and as promised it was a good story and you connect with the characters.",1
30310,"A very good mystery with some good sex and it is a complete game, no waiting....",1
30311,"I have read a good number of AVNs, although this is the first time I have actually taken the time to write a review. I'll discuss what I think are the key elements to an enjoable AVN one at a time below.

Story:
Excellent.  I cared about the plot and the characters from the beginning and was drawn in quickly.  The characters also had a depth and complexity to them that added significantly to the story.

Writing:
Very good.  By admission, the author is not a native English speaker, and that does show from time to time.  Those moments are occasional, however, and in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the story or its fluidity.

Artwork:
The still images were beautiful, as were the characters. Some AVNs will exaggerate certain parts of the human form but not so with this AVN.  The women were simply stunningly beautiful in an almost approachable way.

Animations:
If I had to pick one area for improvement, this would be it.  Some of the physics seemed unnatural and some of the animation speeds were too accelerated.

Overall:
It was one of the better AVNs I've read.  As noted, the animation quality wasn't always on par with the best AVNs I've read, but the story, the characters, and the still artwork all were on par with the best AVNs I've experienced, and that's saying a lot.",1
30312,"Ok so this game is OK, and by that the story is good, but the choices and the girl you pick doesn't have any impact on the game at all. There are no extra comment from other people to who you choose and like. Let me give you and example. You pick the girl who you known your entire life and are in love with her. And choose every dialog option to her favor and turn down every other girls. The difference is a extra dialog  and 1 sex s.. There are pretty much none different in dialog apart from a few extra dialog and 1 sex scene with her. And the ending is a 5 image with her. That's it. So I like the game, but playing through it just get me annoyed about about whatever you choose almost doesn't make any different. And the ending REALLY just piss you off. No matter who girl you pick. It's the same.  And another thing. You turn down someone, and they keep hitting on you like nothing happened and even you already had picked your girl. Even tried to do it in public to make other people see it.",0
30313,There is not enough to this game. It feels 70% complete. If they spruced up a few things and added to the length it'd be pretty decent.,0
30314,"I enjoyed this one. It took me about 9 hours to play all four episodes. There are four love interests to pursue not including the side girls. I thought the dialogue was decent to good. The images were good. Most of the music was good. I liked all of the primary love interests. There are some consequences to the choices you make. The story is good for the most part. I saw one obvious plot hole but it wasn't enough to ruin the experience. The animations could be better. But I still think this is a worthy effort for a shorter length AVN. It's better than average, but not top tier. Price per hour played was worthwhile. I totaled 11.5 hours to get four of the endings and 22 of 25 achievements. The only negative I have for this was there weren't quite enough choices and many segments were predetermined, most likely to avoid too much branching in the story.",1

30316,"Smoking is a bomb you don't drop lategame

30317,"OK, I got this game because two reviews compared it to the Unicorn that is Leap of Faith. Annnnnnd Well it compares. The story is 10/10, and the game is 9/10 overall. The replay ability is going to be high, because there are variables in the choices I did not master (which is rare for me). It is not a Harem game and you end up with one of four LI. They are all great and lovely characters. There are several other characters and they are all cool too. The Big Bad Guy is a worthy evil opponent. I really liked this game and the story. I have to play again soon so I can get the girl I wanted the first time, and then I will go back and get the other great ladies too. Totally worth it, and I am looking forward to the developers next project and that is probably the biggest endorsement I could give. Oh PS I love the little details and there are a lot of nods to other AVR's, even the for-mentioned LOF. If you are on the fence get this game.",1
30318,This was a really good game to play it had a lot of drama in it! I would like to see a Part 2 of this game!,1
30319,"""The Entrepreneur"" isn't a porn or harem story.  The game is heavy on story and light on erotica, but both are very well done.

MC returns to the town he grew up in after his father's death. He rents a room in a house with three women, who all become a potential love interest.  The fourth main LI is a childhood friend.  During the story, your choices will prioritize one girl over the others, eventually locking you in a certain path.  Though it seems that regardless of these choices, you can still end up with an LI if somehow their ""points"" are higher than the others.  In my first playthough I ended up with Val, despite rebuking her advances, instead of Lucy.

The erotic scenes are short but well done, they fit in the story and don't detract of what's going on.  In total the game features 16 erotic scenes, divided across 7 girls (4 LI + 3 optional encounters), all scenes can be skipped or avoided entirely.

To get 100% achievements, you'll have to play through the game several times.  I took me about 8 hours to play through the game once, then another 2 to find all remaining achievements.",1
30320,My first play through Lasted 17 hours...sorry I like to act out each character anyway.  I don't know what the hell Valentine meant at the beginning with the language barrier etc. This was the most well put together and interesting Story I've read since leap of Faith and Leap of faith was the one that made me cry buckets. I cannot wait to see what else you got dev 5/5 Stars,1
30321,"Well written story and on par with some of the other top tier AVNs out there, like Leap of Faith, Being a DIK, and College Kings. Although not as big and does not include mini-games like those other games mentioned, this game has a great story with drama, wisdom, and multiple paths for different girls. It took about 9 hours on my first play through, and I plan to play again through two other girls' paths. Note, this game is lighter on the sexual content compared to other AVNs, but it still has nudity and sexiness. Very well done devs. I look forward to other games created by you.",1
30322,"In my opinion this story was marginal, but not good enough for a thumbs up from me.  Here are the Pros & Cons as I see it to help you make up your own mind.
Pros:
1.  The story is complete
2.  The graphics are not bad
3.  You can personalise the name of the main character and the cat
4.  Considering the developer is French, the English grammar is not that bad
5.  Overall the main characters are likeable
6.  I think this developer has potential
Cons:
1.  Blah, blah, blah...  A long story does not always equal a good story
2.  There are two few meaningful choices and even fewer choices as the story goes on
If you are looking for good adult visual novels on Steam I recommend:  Acting Lessons, Depraved Awakenings, Leap of Faith, Love Season, and Sisterly Lust.  Anyway, I hope this is helpful.",0
30323,"really good, thought it was going to be a total parody of good AVNs for a bit then it toned down.
about all of the good ones do get a nod FYI.
since the creator decided to do more AVNs I'm disappointed this is a one shot.
it felt short because it was so good i expected more or was really hoping for more story's with the same MC
My main criticism is the different endings are sorta tacked one at the end with only a couple of branches in the story like he got a little burned out at the end not even bothering to write anymore story just some post game stills.",1
30324,"First I want to congratulate the developer for producing such a great game by himself as his first game. You give me hope that one day I will make one myself.

That being said I really have nothing bad to say about this game. The story was interesting. The characters were great, and the ending was dramatic and interesting.

If I had to nit pick I would say the lewd scenes were short and the animations werent the best. Also the after credit scenes were a bit basic. I would have liked to see a few shots of what happened with each character after the game ended rather than a few shots of you and your love interest. Lastly thinking about it....more sound effects would have added greatly to alot of scenes...especially the lewd ones...lol.

I would say overall....
A solid 8/10
Great Vn and would highly recommend.",1

Way more could be done with this concept i think, but for a starter (not much games alike it) its ok.",1

30332,"Johnny changed and ruined my life. 
It all started two days after I bought Guilty Gear -STRIVE- for the first time. While I was on vacation in Texas, I decided to listen to the game's OST for the first time, searching it up on SoundCloud to listen as I was out and about.

I did not get to listen to the game's OST. SoundCloud kept playing Just Lean, Johnny's theme, instead. It kept occurring until eventually every other song was Just Lean. After joking with some friends, I decided to call it quits for the night and stop listening after nearly the 30th Just Lean appeared. When I returned home, it was unfortunate what little I knew of my fate. 

I was very interested in the game and wanted to expand, choosing to buy a DLC character for $6.99. But out of my indecisiveness, I left it all up to a dice roll. I put Johnny on there as a joke, claiming I'd buy him solely for his song so I could torment others with it. He appeared once again. As the die landed on a two, which was the number I assigned to buying Johnny, my fate was sealed. 

It was destined, as just a day after using him I realized just how hard I fell in love. He is a wonderful character and perfectly matches my taste in playstyle. Johnny is such a girl dad. There is no other character left in the game for my interests. Johnny took his Mist Finer and slashed my brain cells until there was only enough to know and focus on him. I do not have the capacity to think about anyone else but Johnny. Live, laugh, love Johnny. 

His gameplay is, in my opinion, very fun with the long pokes and stylish combos. They say he is a zoner, but he's really more of just a balance character. I do not understand how else to word how to use Johnny because I learned how to play him on pure monkey brain instinct. I was just destined to become a Johnny main. 

I, as an aroace woman, have truly found the exception. Hardly any other fictional man could ever reach such standards but this blond cowboy samurai pirate himbo that flips coins grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and changed me for the worse. God, I would save a horse for this man.",1

He play very interestingly, and has a bunch of tools to help him mid range and long range alike.
He is most deadly at setups, when you allow him to throw cards and give him space to conjure a plan.
His slashes and heavy slashes consist of a wild arrange of sword slashes.. Crazy right?
His kicks and punches are a bit abundant, since they don't really help you in many situations, they're quite shit and are nothing put poking tools for someone incredibly close, to get out of a blockchain. Tho they still miss a standing Giovanna. So take that as you will.

Johnny, a character not mobile, and not effective mid close range. He accels at taking advantage of space.
If you give him time, that's all he needs baby. He has intriquite combo routes, with many moves (2) pushing him forward.

I don't really want to make a fully indepth guide nor his frame data, you can find that elsewhere. But, he's a well rounded character. I still don't get the hype around him, but he's easy to pick up, and very fun to play. Worth the money, and he has a banging theme.

When talking about her gameplay... It's a disaster.
She is way too straightforward and lacks any kinf of depth, making her the most dull out of the Strive cast.
Her combo routes aren't interesting or have much potential, when other Strive characters get to differ in that. Her combos are always buttons > (bomb if possible) > buttons > rekka.
She isn't fun to play as or to play agaisnt.
I genuinely do hope she's entirely reworked, it makes me very sad on how they managed to make Strive Bridget more similar to Xrd Elphelt than Strive Elphelt is.
As she is, I can't recommend her as a good DLC addition as it feels like a cashgrab that you have fun with one hour and then go ""Wait, that's all she does?"".
I know this is prominent in Strive, but even for Strive standards, she goes below that.
Sol gets to do so much stuff and has a lot of depth despite being easy to pick-up. Elphelt however doesn't have that level or nearly half the tools he does. She could've been the strongest, she could've been the weakest, but regardless of that, she's not fun.

Strive: Elphelt's theme is so good but I kill her before it gets to the good part

She's a fun gorilla character but she is just so damn awful. She was basically fully realized on release day since her kit is overall pretty lacking and she has next to no routes which is the polar opposite of her Xrd version possibly because she was overall disliked for being so broken so ArcSys decided to not bring that back and this is what they came up with. The only way you're going to win consistently on this character is against casual inexperienced players so I personally do not recommend picking her up. The only positives is her design, theme and failgirl disposition so zero gameplay aspects.

30390,"The returning champion and dreaded demon herself has come to Strive, this time having undergone a spiritual journey of enlightenment. Now the singer for a death metal band, Elphelt has transformed from a game-ruining hellspawn into an offensive beast that's equal parts fun to play as and fight. Elphelt, while having a surprisingly good mid-range presence with some massive buttons (her f.S is comparable to that of Ramlethal), is ultimately a rushdown character who gets in with a combination of strong neutral presence and mobility. While she can break through the opponent's block with left/right mixups in the form of her 214H, a jumping crossup that allows her to attack in the air afterwards, her block pressure comes primarily in the form of her unique rekka, Chain Lollipop.

It starts with 214S, an advancing 20 frame mid that's -2 on block. While lacklustre on its own, it can then be followed up with (214)P, a 14 frame high, (214)K, a 14 frame low, another (214)S, or a (214)H, a 13 frame mid that is -5 on block with massive pushback. (214)S can be repeated infinitely with a 6-frame gap, but following up (214)P/K with anything other than (214)S will end the rekka. In addition, (214)H will always end the rekka, so it's only used to either disengage pressure safely or end a combo. All this means that after starting Chain Lollipop, Elphelt can hammer the opponent with high/low mixups until they guess wrong or successfully mash out of pressure (which is easier said than done.) Add on its insanely satisfying potential in combos, especially after a launch, and you have one of my favourite moves in any fighting game. 

She's not without her weaknesses, though. With a x1.09 damage received modifier, a 5 frame jab as her fastest move, and a 13 frame super as her only reversal, once the tables turn against her, Elphelt seriously struggles to escape pressure.

To wrap it all up, if a character who initiates pressure by playing a strong neutral game only to transition into brutral high/low mixups with a fun, unique repeatable rekka, but who is constantly one blocked c.S away from near-certain doom sounds like a fun time to you, Elphelt is a must-buy.",1
30391,"edit: my opinion on her has changed drastically since i made this review. i will attempt to update it below. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW REVIEW

tl;dr: she's incredibly fun and very jumpy, causing her to be the most fun i've had in guilty gear. EVER. even when i just free-balled her i knew pretty much what to do, and i had lots of fun not even knowing half of the moves by heart. you can practically make a million combos with her and i couldn't recommend her more to literally anyone, especially if you're even considering getting her. to me, she seems like ONE of the absolute best ggst characters in the roster (so far), and i can't wait to see her against the other characters! i am so glad that she is in this roster. couldn't have asked for more.

you don't even have to move with her with the joycons/keyboard. you just have to use her moves and she will move for you. she's incredibly lightweight and has like a million different combos you can do with her. she is super fun and nowadays i'd even consider her one of the best characters- she's pretty easy to play but if you want to learn her combos you have to do more with her than just free-ball it (which is what i did in my old review... i JUST recently looked at her movelist a few days ago and after an hour or so of pure testing and whatnot, i've gotten WAY better at her). she is a bit of a cheat, but she is incredibly fun. every time i open the game i go on maniac difficulty and go against whatever character, 5 stocking them and perfecting them like it's nothing. i absolutely love this character. i originally got her just because, but now she's practically my main. i've never been this happy to waste 8 dollars in my life. but enough about me. she's easy to learn for the most part, and very bouncy. if you like sin or any other characters like giovanna nd whatnot, then you'll probably like her. even if you play heavier characters, i feel like her speed would be a nice break. like i said in my old review, her theme is awesome. i still loop it and at this point i know the lyrics. elphelt is genuinely the most fun i've had on guilty gear, and i couldn't recommend her more to anyone even considering getting her. if you're struggling with her, take your time. if you just don't like her, that's fine! everyone has different opinions, and i hope you soon enough find the guilty gear strive character for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD REVIEW

tl;dr she's very lightweight with easy playability- would really only need a few tweaks to put her up to the other characters, but other than that she is incredibly fun. in order to beat real players you would need to get used to her, but she is very smooth to play with. also fire theme.

i wanna say one thing right off the bat- she's incredibly slow when it comes to walking towards your enemies, however, most of her speed is used up on her moves. you can practically flow into any move you want with the main hit keys (k, l and sometimes even i or u). she has very low health causing her to nearly die immediately by slayer or potemkin if they hit you with their best move (or just a punch lol), but i feel as if that's a given. she's incredibly lightweight and very very jumpy. she has a gun but she isn't necessarily a ranged character. she doesn't have a meter which makes sense in a way but also doesn't, though i feel as if she's a lot more fun without one. i was originally scared of getting her because of people making her out to be annoying- however, i feel as if this was a fine purchase and a very fun one at that. and to the negative review; i played against my highly experienced friend and still beat him just fine. you just have to be careful with her and really think about your moves, but other than that, i'd say she's fairly beginner friendly and would really only need a few tweaks to get her up to the other characters. also, her theme FUCKING ROCKS. this is the one theme i will be looping on spotify cause it's so good...",1

Here is a list:
Her gun hurtbox extends way to far that using any other normals for range besides 5H can be dangerous in certain matchups.
Her framedata is way to slow for a character that is supposed to be a rush down that many of her normals and specials get beat out in many situations.
She is way to reliant on her rekka.
Her rekka sometimes drops in certain situations against certain characters.
Any character with a dp can beat her rekka which makes up a huge portion of her game plan.
She is not very flexible or versatile.
I know every character needs a weakness but some of these weakness straight up negate the some her design purpose and leads to matches being less fun and more frustrating, or worse, boring.

But to reuse Bridgets run stop animations is something else. I'm not recommending this not only because I do not like her design and the reuse of lots of things. Also alongside her overall gameplay, I will update and elaborate on this further when I get to play her but from her overview, she is

30429,"Honestly I was skeptical when she first released, but outside of the occasional ""girl power"" line making me a cringe a bit, I absolutely love her.  Although I'll admit that I'm a bit bias as she was my main in Xrd.

[b]Personality[/b]
I was a bit worried that the heavy metal singer personality would completely replace her old personality from Xrd.  I'm glad that it was more of an addition to her pre-established personality, rather than a retcon of said pre-established personality.

[b]Design[/b]
I don't love her official artwork, but I love her in-game appearance, it's cute.  (Also the microphone gun is really cool.)
The biggest complaint I have is that I wish her 2nd color palette was her primary color palette, but I can just use the 2nd color palette instead so it's not really an issue.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Her fighting style is fast-paced and offense focused.  I hate being on the defensive in fighting games, so having tools to turn the tables and force my opponent on the defensive has definitely improved the gameplay experience.

[b]Theme[/b]
This game has probably one of my favorite soundtracks of any game I've played and Elphelt's theme ""Extras"" does not disappoint.

S+++++++ Tier best char in game by a large margin. 

Normal's that trump other chars normals, and is constantly safe compared to other chars hard to punish and seems to also have very high defense too. So even if you do land a combo you need 3-4 bnb's  on her to her 1 combo and 1 normal on you, and  they are super easy combos that can take 90% of your health, 100% if your chipp.

The only weakness this char has is that she is slow at round start and has to go into a super state that is super easy to charge (she actually starts with meter for it) doesn't have any negatives when she loses it so don't think you can really punish her with anything but a throw when its about to run out.

How this was allowed to release in this state I don't know, but if you want to be a skill-less loser and have a very high win rate, pick this char,

Also this is How I view the current State of Strive as of the ABA patch This should make it more clear on what DLC to buy if you don't buy the season passes.

If you want to put in more effort than a preschooler puts into his crayon drawings, then I'd recommend literally anyone else.",0
30488,"Slayer is everything i had hoped for and more. lore, gameplay, and an interwoven story in the entire guilty gear universe - it's a pleasure to see Slayer make his triumphant return to Strive. 

within his previous iteration in XRd, i was drawn to Slayer because of his closer focus on loops instead of combos; as someone who struggles with long winded strings of hits, his more laissez-faire manner of play really hooked me. i'm more than happy to say that they kept his most integral qualities when porting him over to strive! though i have not had much time to play him just yet, he is absolutely wonderful and i look forward to playing more. now while gameplay is important, of course, i want to touch on something else pertaining to his character - his dandyism, naturally. 

paraphrasing from a thread i made a while back, and as a dandy myself, i can confidently say that Slayer is such a testament to the practice of dandyism as a whole! his gameplay is oozing with dramatic flair and charm, his wit in his story mode is cutting edge, and his lifestyle lets us know precisely what it is that he is about -- dandyism. 

at its core, dandyism is a lifestyle & a socialpolitical statement. it aims to make oneself a spectacle detached from things like race, class, sex, etc, specifically with the intent of fighting back against the upper echelon of things. a dandy always places particular importance on being well-groomed, put together, and full of cunning wit. this persona is a masquerade which often belies a more middle to lower class upbringing, which the dandy strives to escape from or outright abolish. now while in his lore Slayer comes from a noble family, in being what he is, he is still a perfect depiction of dandyism in popular media. 

Albert Camus phrases it best - ""The dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means. But it is an aesthetic of negation. To live and die before a mirror: that, according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition [to society]. He can only exist by defiance . . . The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live [life]."" Slayer's aestheticism and the ways within which he brings it to the guild uphold the tenets of the act. 

The dandy is not a thoughtless fop, however; he is meticulously defined, yet without definition all the same. he is a statement on nothing and everything at once. and in finding dress, the dandy finds himself and the selfsame passion for all things around him. Slayer's adoration for Sharon and the passion he now finds for the world around him is a renewal of his dandyism after so long spent practising it!",1
30489,"[h1]Punched the sh-t outta Bridget and it felt real good[/h1]
Thanks ASW. Slayer cured half of my PTSD after Testament release.
Although I think his 2S pretty much doomed Raven from coming back...",1
30490,"Slayer is a character who historically has microscopic range, a somewhat difficult time putting together combos, relies on jank to be viable, and occasionally he gets lucky, at which point the opponent disintegrates. He's traditionally a low tier pick, but people play him because he's cool, or they really love the jank.

In this game, Slayer has microscopic range, a moderately difficult time putting together combos, relies on jank to be viable, and about 40% of the time he gets lucky, at which point the opponent disintegrates, usually to a dandy shirtless ultra mega punch. For whatever reason, this makes people very upset.

To placate the Xrders, Slayer's gimmick is danger time, but without the RNG. Hitting the opponent with blood sucking cosmo- UNIVERSE bestows danger time-like properties to Slayer's next hit, prompting a huge UNIVERSE!!!!!!! on the screen instead of COUNTER!!!!! enabling kuso levels of damage and combo routing that even HnK veterans can agree are simply hilarious.

Honestly I would have paid the same amount for Slayer as I did for guilty Gear strive in a heartbeat. Give me a plushie this instant, and for his merch give me your entire stock.

[h1]Kinda Reminds Me Of Brotato NGL‚Ä¶[/h1]

Chaotic Pursuit is a hardcore top-down shooter that combines cute graphics with intense gameplay. In this review, we'll delve into the game's storyline, gameplay mechanics, visuals and audio, as well as its pros and cons. So, grab your trusty weapon and get ready for an adrenaline-pumping adventure where a single missed shot could be your downfall.

[h1]About This Game [/h1]

[h2]Storyline [/h2]

In Chaotic Pursuit, you step into the shoes of a blind marksman armed with superhuman senses. Your mission is to eliminate one-eyed creatures relentlessly pursuing you. While the premise is straightforward, it adds an intriguing layer to the game's intensity. The narrative may be minimal, but it effectively serves its purpose as a backdrop to the chaos that ensues.

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2]

The core gameplay of Chaotic Pursuit revolves around shooting and dashing skills. The twist here is that you have no room for error ‚Äì miss a shot, and you're out! This unique mechanic adds a thrilling level of tension to each encounter. The game offers 20 challenging levels set in various environments such as forests, deserts, ice lands, and farms. You'll need to rely on your sharp aim and quick reflexes to survive.

The simplicity of the controls is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it makes the game accessible and easy to pick up. On the other, it might leave players craving more depth and variety in their abilities. The promise of hidden secrets adds an element of mystery and encourages players to explore further. Lastly, do not assume that the game is very easy when you just start playing it. Trust me, it gradually becomes harder and the overconfidence you rack up will work against you.

[h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]

Chaotic Pursuit's visuals strike a charming balance between cute and chaotic. The one-eyed creatures are adorably menacing, and the game's environments are well-designed, offering a refreshing change of scenery across its different maps. However, some players might wish for more diversity in character design and enemy types.

The audio in Chaotic Pursuit complements the gameplay nicely. The sound effects enhance the tension, making every shot and dash feel impactful. While the soundtrack is catchy and fits the game's atmosphere, it can become repetitive over time.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] The unique ""one-shot, one-kill"" concept adds a thrilling layer of tension and challenge.
[*] With 20 levels spanning diverse environments, there's a decent amount of content to keep players engaged.
[*] The game's cute yet menacing art style sets it apart from typical shooters.
[*] Chaotic Pursuit is budget-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of players.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] Some players may find themselves wishing for more levels, enemy types, and abilities to keep the gameplay fresh.
[*]  The game's simplistic controls might leave more hardcore gamers looking for additional complexity.
[*] The catchy soundtrack can become repetitive during extended gameplay sessions.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Chaotic Pursuit is an engaging top-down shooter that stands out thanks to its unique ""miss a shot and you're out"" gameplay mechanic. It offers a good challenge with its 20 levels and cute visuals. However, its simplicity and limited content may leave some players wanting more. Despite its shortcomings, Chaotic Pursuit is an enjoyable experience, especially given its affordable price point. If you're ready for a slightly punishing top-down shooter with a twist, give it a shot, but be prepared to embrace the chaos!

30615,"This game is so polished! I haven't played much of it yet, but I have a few pieces of feedback nevertheless.

The game feels a little too ""smooth"". Don't get me wrong, I love the amount of polish here, but the movement of the platform feels to clunky and delayed, and on top of that, they reduce speed with the slowdown mechanic which makes it incredibly hard to move them precisely and quickly with the slowmo enabled. The game feels really clunky at times - and for a precision puzzle game that's a big nope.

Other than that, it's really good. I could 100% see this getting picked up by a larger distributor or developer, and with some more development time, turn into a 10/10 puzzle title.

At the moment, feels more like a protoype type thing. Not in a bad way, but in the sense that it needs a little more cooking time to get all of the gameplay issues I mentioned out.

30616,"good chill game, some levels are pretty difficult but overall not that hard.",1
30617,"this game is great, it could do with some good music, and possibly some other things, but overall its still a good game, just VERY fvcking annoting.",1
30618,Pretty fun game! Although some of the background elements in parts look like foreground elements i still give it a 8/10,1
30619,"Short little action game that offers nice art, fluid gameplay and cool atmosphere.

The game's protagonist is an anonymous individual who wakes up next to a heap of corpses. A beating orb just next to it entices him to investigate. He receives a blade and understands exactly what must be done.

Playing is simple and controls flow well. You only have the sword strike, jump, and dash, which also serves as a dodge. Later on, you obtain a gun and a massive sword attack, both of which come at a cost. Because you lose health with each activation, it's best to save them for challenging situations. There‚Äôs no stamina, so that‚Äôs one thing you don‚Äôt have to worry about. 

The game's world is linear. There is no opportunity to explore or make decisions. You're just traveling in a straight line and taking out enemies, listening to the occasional nice creature you meet along the road, and attempting to figure out what's going on in this odd setting. Basic dashing on platforms and over deadly pits is also included, but this is only difficult towards the end when you juggle different mechanics. 

The only vital information on the screen is a red bar in the upper left corner representing your health. Although every received blow saps quite a bit of your lifeforce, it is relatively easy to regain it. All you have to do is kill an enemy. 

But since you gain very little, it might be smarter to avoid enemies or attack only when it‚Äôs safe to do so. There‚Äôs a nice variety of enemies in each of the locations you visit. Since enemies don‚Äôt drop anything, you might as well ignore them. However, this is not always possible because barriers halt your progress until their guardians are destroyed.

You travel through many environments. True, the game doesn't use many colors, but the world is nonetheless vibrant thanks to excellent pixel art. Each place is distinct and has completely fresh assets and mechanics. A boss blocks you from moving to a new location. They only have a few simple attacks that are easy to learn, so you should have no issue beating them after a few tries. 

Death comes quickly. You won't lose progress because the game saves automatically whenever you enter a new screen. The bad news is that the game saves the amount of health as well. You do not heal after respawning. This means it's very easy to find yourself in a difficult battle with nearly no health. You can grind health from a creatures that generates enemies or destroy a healing object, but these only show up in certain screens.

It doesn't take long to finish the game, perhaps two hours. There are no achievements or rewards at the end, so you will play it once and never again.",1
30620,"Fun, challenging action platformer with a pleasantly moody atmosphere. Platforming is inventive and while it doesn't break the mold, it executes on its mechanics well. Combat is a bit lackluster, feels more like a puzzle to solve rather than a reaction based challenge. Very short, hit credits in my 1.5 hours, but worth it for the price.",1
30621,"Thank god that Penusmic is a pixel art wizard, cause everything else in this game is shocking. It has the foundations of a pretty solid experience, but the developer clearly had no intentions of polishing this one out. There are thousands of typos, a bunch of untested level design, broken controller support, tons of baffling design choices, and I-frames don't work half the time. Also the volume bar resets when you enter a new room which I found to be the most exciting part of the game. 

The game released way before the developer estimated, and I think that the game would've at least been playable if it wasn't so rushed. The final boss was decent to say the least. For ¬£9, this is a bit of a scam, however I hope the developer got a lot of experience when making this game, and I wish him all the best in the future.

30622,Nice Game!,1
30623,"6hrs in roughly and also playing through chapter 6 as of this review. Highly recommend, fun little indie game and worth every penny. Good music too.",1
30624,"Puzzle platform game with a different touch, mixing with the present and ghosts of the past and mixing with the narrative, creative!",1
30625,Fantastic little puzzle platformer with a thought-provoking story to boot. Gameplay feels like a lightweight combination of Braid and Celeste.,1
30626,"This game resonated with me. I really really liked it. The game is short, but emotional. The levels are clever. Most of the puzzles are fun.

My only real complaint is that the English is awkward in places.",1
30627,"This felt like a very well made little game. The emotional story and the puzzle mechanics revolving around a past-self worked really well together throughout, and I enjoyed the mechanics changing along with the tone of the character each chapter. Most rooms needed some thought to get through and it was fun to solve the easier and more difficult ones alike, and the B-Side levels that show off each chapter's mechanics at their most complex was a great addition too. I'm glad I found and played this, and it's a very easy recommend.",1
30628,"I really highly recommend this as it's both a good puzzle game and the story feels very connected to it. I really love how connected the gameplay and the story are. The music is great too, gonna try the B-sides next",1
30629,"Two days after completing the game in around four hours, its charm still resonates within me. The brilliance of this experience lies in the seamless blend of level design and storytelling, crafting a world that is both immersive and profound. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone with a sense of empathy or those who can find reflections of their own imperfect selves within its characters.",1
30630,"Very sweet and well designed puzzle platformer where you work alongside (or sometimes against) your past actions to solve each level. New mechanics are introduced and combined throughout the game and the difficulty is managed well throughout the whole game, which made every puzzle fun and satisfying to solve. The main story took me just under 3 hours to beat, however there is also and additional set of about 50 ""B-side"" levels which I haven't tried out yet which contain more difficult puzzles.

One thing this game does a particularly good job of is linking its story to the gameplay - the textboxes appear dynamically throughout each level as you solve them, and the meanings of them relate to both the story as a whole as well as the current puzzle you're solving. This makes solving each puzzle feel even more rewarding, as the character you play as overcomes her struggles alongside you overcoming each level. The only complaint I have is that the english translations can occansionally be a little wonky, although never so much so that the original intent of words is lost.",1
30631,"This is a very good puzzle platformer game! The puzzles are challenging and fair, you can restart a challenge any time if you get stuck and the game teaches you its mechanics really well as you play along. You can't pet the animals though so I substract some points because of this, but overall, I had a good time with the game.",1

- Beautiful artstyle & music (very calm & chill, plus a sprinkle of sadness)

30638,"""Laruaville 2"" is a great match-3 game with unique mechanics and minigames (Mahjong, solitaire and hidden object games). It runs flawlessly and it will stimulate your brain! A very tricky match-3 with power-ups and unique ways to solve the puzzles. Help the cute ghosts to fix the moon that has fallen from the sky!

The levels themselves are hard but leave an impression and above all they are fun. So you will be glad it wasn't a piece of cake that required no thinking and ended in 10 minutes. The visual effects, animations and music will help a lot in keeping you calm and focused on the task at hand.
If you are stuck, you can use the hint system, which I find very good, comprehensive and helpful. 

It will keep you busy for hours but without overstaying its welcome and you can always replay it due to its nature. Featuring different modes, minigames and building your town!

One of the most fun and intriguing match-3 puzzle games out there.

30640,"My chat loves this game.  It's great for running during advertisements.  Since subscribers and other people who do not see ads have nothing to do during the breaks, this provides them with a fun game to do.",1
30641,"very good game to interact with others, a way to build up game knowledge. Definitely recommend if you are a streamer.",1
30642,"I've been using this game for my stream the last few weeks and my chat absolutely loves it!!
I have the game running when I need to take a break but chatters also like redeeming it with their channel points.
Nice and easy to set up and works seamlessly every stream.

I would recommend this to every streamer out there!!",1
30643,"Chat Guess Games is such a fun stream game. Provides amazing opportunity for chat engagement, getting the blood boiling trying to get the points for guessing the game right. If you are a streamer, this is your perfect idle chat game, BRB game, or even just something to run at any point. Pick it up if you get the chance",1
30644,Great for chat interactivity on stream. Highly recommend. Also the developer is continuously active and working on it.,1
30645,"Lots of fun. Great as a distraction while chatting, having a slow day or to just scream at other chatters ""HOW DID YOU GUESS"". Would caps again in chat.",1
30646,Great addition to any Twitch stream. A lot of fun from the streamer side and the player side. The dev is actively developing and makes frequent updates!,1
30647,"My Chat loves playing this game more than they enjoy my content. The in stream competition to climb the leader board is insane sometimes. I didnt have Chat Guess for my Ad break/Bio break for one stream and i swear my chat was going to riot. 

Unfortunately because i am overshadowed by this game in the eyes of my Chat, I cant give this game a good recommendation.



But seriously I give this game 10 out of 10 Boba Teas. Get this game, you wont regret it! Watching this game from creation to being on steam has been fun. As things are constantly being updated, dont worry if there is a problem. The goofball of a developer will get to it...eventually... hopefully. 

Gero~",0
30648,"I found CGG a fun and creative tool for any streamer looking for a way to engage their Twitch chat, especially during a pre-roll or while taking a break. The developer is active in curating the game database, making bug fixes and providing updates. The retro category addition is a welcome feature that focuses on a different gamer demographic than regular CGG, and I highly encourage retro and family-friendly streamers to get this!",1
30649,"Highly recommend this game. I first got it for breaks in streaming, but the intensity from chat in the competition and leaderboard has me playing it more often now. Get ready to be lauded for your game knowledge - or shamed from your lack XD

Easy to understand interface with idiot proof instructins. And any suggestions or questions are very quickly handled by the dev. 


Ya know what - I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you regret getting this game I'll shave all my hair off!",1
30650,"Chat Guess Game has greatly enhanced my Twitch broadcasts by being a simple to use but fantastic way to engage with my community.  It allows Twitch streamers to run a trivia game where chatters attempt to guess the titles/series of a video game with gameplay screenshots and hints that appear on the screen.  There is a leaderboard that keeps score for the individual users in the broadcaster's channel as well as the channel compared to other channels.  it has a pretty substantial library of games it pulls from ranging from the past several decades of gaming.

It's easy to setup by linking to the broadcaster Twitch channel and add as a source to broadcasting software.  I generally run it manually by launching through Steam and toggling autoplay on or off.  Rounds of Chat Guess can also be initialized by your community members with channel points redeems.

CGG been a great addition particularly during BRB screens or times when I have to troubleshoot stream/tech issues in the middle of broadcast.  Gives chat something fun to do while I try to figure out how to unmute my mic or take a lengthy toilet break due to the amount of hot sauce my community redeemed me to drink from a shot glass.  God.",1
30651,"I love this game!

Super handy for when you need to leave stream for a bit!
Also for when you're doing co-working streams, great for viewers who are just chilling and not working!
Also a great way to start/end stream...and warm-up and a wind-down for sure!

But if you're like me and you're just really chatty this is where it shines. I often just sit there with the game on auto-play and chat away, as I find different games appearing on screen seem to bring up new topics CONSTANTLY, it's never ending. Running out of steam on one topic *boom* up pops Black & White ""oh hey isn't this designed by Peter Molyneux, that dude who over promises on his game...blah blah blah"" and we're back to chatting!

Also the Developer seems to be doing a lot of quality of life updates, as I often come back to see new features added (that I wanted)...and it seems that the selection of games seems to be more curated as time goes on!",1
30652,"I have the game to use in my own stream for engagement, and have played it several times in other streams. CGG definitely poses a challenge for even regular gamers. The Dev is very active in making improvements, and even participates in streams playing the game. The interface is very minimal, but still decently configurable to suit your preferences and your overlay placements.",1
30653,"This is a must have for Twitch streamers. A wide catalogue of games to guess, challenging enough to make even the more serious gamers get involved...and still not get it right! Easy to set up (even I could set it up) and adds a bit of fun competition to your streams. Lynch is regularly working on patches and updates for the game. Very much recommended. Thanks Lynch!",1
30654,"Makes a fun little game around streams - great for adding something interesting to quieter moments, like BRB screens and grinding in game. Would recommend if you're a streamer.",1
30655,"Have it set up to automatically play during breaks in the stream, works perfectly, chat loves playing it, gives them something to do while I go to the bathroom ext.

I highly recommend this game for stream.",1

30657,"Do you obsess with finding a way to be successful now that your college days are over and the career you worked so hard to get into is actually causing you severe depression? Yes?

30664,"So the year was 1986. According to my mom, she shot me out like an autocannon. A nurse caught me and they all celebrated as she slammed me into the ground shouting touchdown. The nurses picked me up and wrapped me in silk woven blankets. They handed me to my mother. I was just born but apparently, I already knew my first words. 

Chatguess ..... Gaaaaames. 

No one knew what I meant. I drove my parents insane by only ever saying chatguess games. 15 years later I finally learned new words. 

Then one day, I accidentally walked into this bald guys stream. He was making a game. Chatguess Games. My lifes purpose was right there in front of me. Download this game so that while I am on break from my woeful streams, people in my chat can do something. It was so quick to download, I didn't even have enough time to look up some good porn while I waited. 

I downloaded it and instantly, this guy called Jimmy starts showing up and guessing games. He might come with the game, I don't know, but god damn, he is the champion of guessing games. He is what it would be like if the pantheon of gods also included one who knew video games really well. 

But yeah it's a pretty solid game. 10/10. GG's. Pogchamp. Hype. *insert more buzzwords*",1
30665,"Not bad I've just started, but it's kept my interest. I'll update this review when I get more. I would love a glossary for terms at least though. Also I believe the renpy engine is used, never thought about that for a text game, so that's pretty unique if it is the renpy game engine. Give it a try, it's not expensive and you don't really have anything to lose.

Played a bit more, just got Athos and the town. The Humor is so worth it.",1
30666,"This must be one of the most under-rated games/VNs on Steam!  I almost missed it, and its well worth having a look at for the artwork and the music, as well as the entertaining story. I think it was originally made for a cell phone app, but the port to Windows is more professional than many more expensive games from well established developers. 
I have just finished my first run through, and thoroughly enjoyed it! Unlike many VNs, this is not anime, and is based on legends of dragons, elves and other mythical people, and set in a fantasy country sometime in the past. The characters are all individuals, and you can choose the gender of some and whether to romance them or not. You can definitely trade insults with them (some are wonderfully snarky), and have sensitive private moments as well. I had a good ending, but I'm sure I only have part of the story, with a long way to go!
This was crafted by a talented Indie artist, and for less than the price of a coffee or soft drink, you can enjoy a game that will last much longer than the memory of your last drink!",1
30667,"This game is unbelievably amazing I can hardly believe it was created by one person. This feels like it should have been created by a team of at least 3 people.  This feels like a Bioware game without the gameplay, which let's be honest, if you're me the gameplay was just a fun addition to your roleplay romance game. The choices in this game are weighted like a Bioware game and the romanceable characters are fully fleshed out and I want to romance every single one of them. Even the characters who you think you might dislike, if you get to know them a bit you fall in love with them. From what I understand this is one game that takes place in a massive universe and I hope the creator uploads those to steam too! 

Seriously, the choices in this game keep me in such suspense that I have stopped playing just to think out the consequences of one massive choice. Give this game a try, it's incredible, and at two bucks, what do you have to lose?",1
30668,"This game was quite the pleasant surprise. I love text-based interactive fiction games. But I had hesitantly bought this at the time, due to it's very low price. I thought that because the price was so cheap (1.99), perhaps the game was probably super short, or had very little content, but I was completely wrong! It had enough content to be almost 10hrs worth of game-play for me. But that's with me only romancing the 3 male ROs, and playing the best friend route with Gruzi where you romance no one. 

For me though, I'm personally finished with this game now. It was a really great story and I would honestly love to see another within this universe and with more detailed romance scenes and even more descriptive sex scenes, since they were more fade to black. That and the romance scenarios felt very light. 

But either way, I highly recommend this game! I played this on my steamdeck and it worked great, for anyone interested. With how much went into this game, it should honestly be worth more! I'm so surprised it isn't $10.00 instead. You have the options to pick your gender, there's LGBTQ+ romances, there's even some CGs, and background music! Definitely recommend, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1
30669,"Interesting story, not a fan of the endings, they left me a bit disappointed...however, for the price its well worth the read.",1
30670,"This is a very charming and engaging story! It reminded me a lot of the choose-your-own-adventure books I would read as a kid. Vogvhathos is immersive in a similar way: compelling and fun in a very easygoing kind of way. Also, you can play as a lady who gets a dragon girlfriend. 10/10",1
30671,"Awesome story! 
Super dynamic characters and a cool fantasy world to explore! 
Definitely worth a read, and there's tons of replay value. 
During my first read I'm already planning my next playthrough!",1
30672,Loved the game. Intricate story with good lore and interesting characters,1
30673,A nice interactive story.,1
30674,"Really fun little 80's themed, apocalyptic, bullet hell wave shooter, with plenty of enemy variety, upgrade options and replay value!

My favourite build so far is with the sniper, Gloria. I got her trigger and reload speed upgrades up nice and high, then re-rolled a few joker cards for some extra damage upgrades. This carried me all the way up to wave 67!

Loving the contra theme and the 80's style pixel art.

Overall would recommend to fan's of Seraph's Last Stand and Vampire Survivors. Looking forward to what my next build will be!",1
30675,"lol this game is  Awesome  (not sarcasm)   because  the guy was genius and combined the fun of twin-stick side-scrolling shooters  (think "" Shoot Many Robots ""  (the Xbox 360 version),  

 Rogue Stormers etc, and mixed with that survivor formula for powerups not only DURING your mission but also PERMANENT power-ups you can buy out of your missions,

 Fantastic game this was the first 'unique' game I saw in eons on steam and it's funny I didn't think of it first (I think up 'wave' shooters all the time)  but you have to hand it to this dev he simplified it to the most essential degree and kept exactly what you need for a FUN game and not all that over-worked agenda-pushing crp on steam nowadays,

 Seriously THIS type of game here is exactly what redeems the trash-heap that steam is,

 for literally every 2-5000 games released every year you get a game like this that shows you some dev somewhere is actually thinking up cool  new unique actually 'fun' games and isn't backed by millions to push agendas and nonsense down your throat, 

 so the presentation is going to be 'rough' but the core gameplay and fun-factor are all there - 

 Kudos to the dev, amazing job !

 
(by the way my play time is low because I had to stop playing or else I would play a game like this all day every day until I max out my character and 'beat' it,

 I just don't have the time now so for a game as addicting as this it's better just to uninstall and not think about or else you're always wanting to play it, 

 lol, seriously)

 
 (Also the music is amazing !!!   This type of game is exactly the type that pictures, screenshots and lame overly-picky nerdy reviews  don't do justice to,

 it's a freaking fantastic game if you want to challenge yourself, have fun, not be soaked full of agendas while playing, 

 listening to blasting retro-wave beats etc etc

 There's no justice that games like this get overlooked while all the hype trash gets pushed on steam.

 Don't expect this game to be a 'circus' on start-up, do expect this game to 'pull you in' like retro games used to do, 

 based on their skill-factor, fun factor and challenge factor, (and 'immersion' factor), and you'll 'get it' and have a blast playing this.

 Could it have better presentation?  Of course, when I first played it the first thing I thought of was all the ways I would do 3D models of the graphics etc,

 but point is the dev did what he could do and it's a great thing, far better that he was actually able to 'make' it then try to fancy up the graphics etc and never have released it in the first place)

 Seriously gamers use your brain and support games like this if you want to play anything else besides hyped steam trash..",1
30676,"Very good & different survivors style game. 
Might need a tiny bit more variety, but is quite enjoyable as is and it still is in Early Access, so can't complain.",1
30677,"I can see this game being very rad after some more updates, There seems to be only one audio track and one stage currently. Both are good. Power ups and unlockables feel good so far. When at least one more stage and maybe some more audio track for some variety I would say this is  an easy buy but until then maybe hold out until a little more is added to the game. Giving it a positive since I think I don't think it needs that much more to be a really good game.

the TLDR:
+ Sega Genesis looking art style
+ The music (Even though only one track)
+ Unlockable weapons, upgrades, and characters feel good.

- Needs more stages
- Needs more then one audio track
- Steam cloud saves would be nice
- Since the game is made using the construct game engine not 100% if this will work on the steam deck (When I get some time will try and edit this later if not true)",1
30678,"Roguelite survival game in an arena platform. A bit monotone and tough to play. 

The nature of most survival games like [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/]DRG: Survivor[/url] or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/]Vampire Survivors[/url] is that it's relatively easy to play. Those games are isometric with a top down view. Survivors Last Stand does it with a sideview, and I don't know if it's done before but it makes the game much harder! You have to be pretty good at platform games, and that is a very specific type of gamer. 

In order to be more pleasing the arena needs more... Maybe a way up so you can walk a circle, or a bit of sidescrolling, I'm not sure.. Plus it looks way too basic now. 

I do think this can work for a certain audience, it just has to be more inviting to play.

30679,"I have been following this game for a long time and was so happy to finally get to play the finished version!!  A whole lot of effort clearly went into this -it takes a basic target/archery style game concept and runs with it in the best way -it's overflowing with creativity, every level actually feels unique and interesting often introducing a new mechanic or puzzly gimmick.  It's a really charming game too, I absolutely love the characters and the art and the music -the whole vibe of it!  It has a fun story with it's own twist on robin hood -lots of character and the humor made me legit laugh out loud a few times -and I gotta say it was nice that the level dialogue kind of just goes on in the background in real time so that I didn't have to skip through it when restarting.

The soundtrack and sound design is fantastic -I've had the pirate shanty sounding song stuck in my head all night.  There was a lot of fun secrets and it had some rewards that I haven't really seen done in many other games -like usually you unlock things like character stills or production art, but instead in this game you unlock small cozy campfire conversations that are like little side stories and also you unlock these little scenes that are kind of almost like screensavers that are really neat to check out -some felt like easter eggs to the main story.  

The game didn't overstay it's welcome and left me wanting more -even after getting all the achievements and a couple of them were pretty tough!",1
30680,"Loved it! The characters, animations and puzzles are fun and the backgrounds are lovely. I love that you can just come in and shoot and still succeed, but if you slow down, the mechanics are really solid for making skill shots. Great game!",1
30681,"Really enjoyed this, fun and challenging, love the art and you can tell it was made with a lot of passion",1
30682,Jaggglisssssss play! Enjoyyy muchh. You Playyy! You much enjoooyyeee toooo...,1
30683,"Fun run and gun that won‚Äôt take a lot of your time.

Despite the appearance of a metroidvania, this is an action game where you go through stages in a linear order. The game takes you through three different worlds, each with its own set of enemies. A world is made out of four stages and a boss fight. All can be finished in a couple of hours.

You start with a basic weapon and gain two more as you kill bosses. Because ammo is infinite, you can keep hitting the fire button as much as you like. Rockets, on the other hand, are in short supply. Although a single rocket can take out an enemy easily, it's recommended to conserve them for walls that can't be destroyed with any other weapon and cracked walls that hide collectibles.

Stages are not very long. They involve a combination of platforming, avoiding threats and killing enemies. The difficulty level is pretty easy, so you should have no trouble if you're familiar with the genre. Boss fights can be a bit tricky. The issue is that you are not offered a lot of freedom due to the extremely small areas that make it impossible to avoid enemy shots. Because your character is so large and cannot dodge, your only option is to jump over projectiles and take occasional hit.

The game is short, so achievements motivate you to play it multiple times. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre not fun because around half of them are for not being hit, falling into acid, and even sparing one type of enemy throughout the entire game. One touch or accidental kill can ruin your entire game.",1
30684,"Quite possibly the worst adult game on steam.  Stay far away. You're welcome.  Literally the game is looking at pictures and reading text boxes with weird porn sounds that don't match, bad music, and text that doesn't match the scene.",0
30685,"if you're looking for a ""NTR game from like 1998 vibe"", get this. otherwise, absolutely don't. the ""gameplay"" is atrocious, the renders are awful (some of which don't even fit on the screen), the models are weird and bad... Just don't. The renders in game are literally much worse than what are in the screenshots.",0

Paired with the endearingly terrible intro, the worst sound design and footstep sounds I've ever heard and random quotes from Picasso (!), this shidpost bad trip camouflaging as walking simulator confused, flabberghasted but ultimately entertained me in a so-bad-it's-good ""trash"" way, especially with it's overbearingly loud ending.

i hope the author the best of wishes for the future of this game and any games they make after this one",1
30720,"For the price they want for this game, it is absolutely not worth it.
The game is too unpolished and unfinished. It's hard to understand what to do, how to survive, half the game is in french even if you play in english. Do not recommend.",0
30721,"A crazy fun game made by crazy people who wanted fun, adult content, some fucked up great art and a little bit hard point&click tactical RPG.
I'm glad to have taken part of this and even as the main tester (in the alpha I coughed up blood because of the quantity of bug); I still discover things 200 hours later.
I'm happy that the game is out, I hope it will work, I wish I will have many more content. I know there still some crazy idea and I will gladly wait for it !!!",1
30722,"Story is good & funny. 
Game play interesting 
Art need to improve some is good but some not complete hope Dev team'll add more.
H-scene High quality and low is so difference, but if it full finish with all High quality you are the best dude.
UI need to make it friendly to player more than this

Cheer up",1
30723,"Even though there are a few bugs, even though a lot of the language is still stuck in french, even though I have no idea what I'm supposed to do sometimes ...

This is still an excellent game and I am not upset with my purchase in the slightest",1
30724,"Pretty expansive gameplay for a lewd game, has some good potential going forward :)",1
30725,"This game alternates between point and click style rooms, rpg combat and minion management. The sex scenes are great, and the main character is definitely still an evil conqueror, but he has relatable problems like dealing with idiots, small town politics run by said idiots, and entertaining people who desperately want to part our dear Pleasuremancer with his hard earned gold. I'm still in the midgame section, the village section, but I'm almost finished with the main quest for this part. Your actions do have consequences, and nowhere is this more apparent than the introduction, where you can completely remove one of the main antagonists from play within the first ten minutes of gameplay. I would consider this a good thing, especially for a first play through. Combat is difficult in ways that can be equally frustrating to struggle through and rewarding to figure out the secrets of.
Ultimately, for a game still in development, it's great. But obviously, there's going to be some nitpicks, although most of them are quality of life perks. For example, when you buy the skeleton key for the baker's quest, it doesn't actually show up in your inventory, so the only reason you know that you have it is because the quest updated. My biggest issue here is that Guild quests are only available under certain circumstances, and disappear if you have saved or quicksaved the game recently. This isn't mentioned to you very clearly, if at all, and you only figure this out when you save before taking on said quest.
The English translation is evidently incomplete even at the beginning of the game, and starts breaking down about when you try to become mayor, but it is especially apparent during Autumn's quest. I wouldn't say it is immersion breaking though. In fact, I wouldn't mind if some of the alchemy recipes, wine names, or magic spells remained in French. The Early Access announcement said that this might be fixed soon, though.",1
30726,"Nice point & click game with some strategy and management component. 
Story is simple but on point and characters are nicely developed.
The lewd side of the game is a bit light but artwork are nice with a cartoon-ish style.",1
30727,the game started out to be fun then it got boring and hard and when i get stronger then when i go to sleep it shows that my strongly decresd and it will be cool if we have cheat and skip the battle that we wont i will give 6/10,0

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Having reached the peak of your craft, you've decided to banish yourself, wishing for better challengers in the future. As luck, or lack thereof, would have it, you find yourself summoned by goblins with a severe lack of intellect. As a result of their failed summonning, you now find yourself relieved of your powers and needing to re-establish yourself.

[h1]Review[/h1]
The most important thing first, this game is in Early Access, and as such will have problems here and there, but I want to underscore that this game oozes of love for the game, so clearly the creator has been pouring his or her heart into this one. It does have a few bugs, one that I kept triggering was when fighting paladins during the starting section. This can easily be bypassed with some save scumming, so at most an annoyance.

With that out of the way, the humor in this game is, while subjective, quite good, and has managed to coax a few smiles out of my soulforsaken face here and there. The game itself is mostly a nostalgia trip to point and click adventures of years passed, could absolutely see lucas games doing something like this if they decided that full on adult content were fine.

The looping BGM is quite degrading to the experience, and would appreciate a bit clearer early game goals explanation, just kinda pressing around and doing whatever lights up. While servicable as a point and click, it could really do with a bit more direction for the player.

One to keep an eye at.

Ah, mes nobles compagnons de l‚Äôaventure vid√©oludique, permettez-moi de vous narrer mon humble √©pop√©e √† travers cet univers captivant, un RPG aussi complet que grisant, o√π chaque instant pass√© √† explorer les m√©andres de ce monde a √©veill√© en moi une ferveur digne des qu√™tes chevaleresques d'antan.

J‚Äôy ai pass√© de nombreuses heures, mes doigts agiles sur les touches, mes pens√©es d√©vou√©es √† la recherche du meilleur chemin, recommen√ßant maintes fois pour affiner mes strat√©gies comme un preux chevalier aff√ªte son √©p√©e. Ce jeu ne se donne pas ais√©ment, mes amis ! Non, sa difficult√© est une agr√©able surprise dans un temps o√π, h√©las, trop de jeux se contentent de nous mener par la main. Ici, chaque d√©cision a son poids, chaque action doit √™tre m√ªrement r√©fl√©chie. Oh, je vous le dis : il faut sauvegarder souvent, car un faux pas pourrait vous √©loigner de certaines r√©compenses aussi pr√©cieuses qu‚Äôinsoup√ßonn√©es !

Quant aux plaisirs plus charnels que le jeu offre, ah ! Ils sont un r√©gal pour l‚Äôesprit et le c≈ìur, une douce attention que le cr√©ateur, dans sa g√©n√©rosit√©, d√©pose en cadeau pour ceux qui savent pers√©v√©rer dans l‚Äôaventure. Ces sc√®nes, mes amis, sont d‚Äôune √©l√©gance rare, et je n‚Äôen dirai pas plus, car il vous faut les d√©couvrir par vous-m√™me, tel un tr√©sor cach√© au fond d‚Äôun labyrinthe.

Mes compagnons, si vous √™tes de ceux qui ch√©rissent autant la strat√©gie que la passion, ce RPG saura vous combler au-del√† de vos esp√©rances.

Sauvegardez, calculez, et partez √† l'aventure ! Mais souvenez-vous, dans ce jeu, la ""main"" qui vous m√®nera √† la victoire n‚Äôest pas seulement celle qui tient l'√©p√©e, mais celle qui sait prendre les bonnes d√©cisions.


English: 
Ah, my noble companions of the gaming adventure, allow me to recount my humble journey through this captivating universe‚Äîan RPG as complete as it is exhilarating, where every moment spent exploring its depths has stirred in me a fervor worthy of the chivalrous quests of old.

I have spent many an hour within its world, my fingers deft upon the keys, my thoughts devoted to finding the best path, restarting countless times to refine my strategies like a knight sharpening his sword. This game does not yield easily, my friends! No, its difficulty is a welcome surprise in a time where, alas, too many games simply guide us by the hand. Here, every decision bears weight, and every action must be carefully considered. Oh, let me tell you: save often, for a misstep could steer you away from certain rewards as precious as they are unexpected!

As for the more carnal delights the game offers, ah! They are a feast for the mind and heart, a gentle favor bestowed by the creator, in their generosity, as a gift to those who persevere through the adventure. These scenes, my friends, are of rare elegance, and I shall say no more, for they are treasures to be uncovered by your own efforts, hidden like gems within a labyrinth.

In short, this game is already quite complete even before its final release, and I assure you that both my gamer's heart and my more sensual inclinations have found all they could desire within. My companions, if you are among those who cherish strategy as much as passion, this RPG will surely fulfill your every expectation.

Save, strategize, and embark on the adventure! But remember, in this game, your ""main"" weapon isn‚Äôt just your sword‚Äîit‚Äôs the wisdom in your hands.",1

30746,"After digging into the first quarter patch, it still feels very badly balanced. Improvements came in the increased need to utilize items, but this came at the cost of inventory feeling overstuffed just to carry a viable loadout beyond 2 skull missions. Enemies become far too common to contend with in any quasimorphosis zone at higher rating because you will run out of food, medical supplies, ammo, or trigger quasimorphosis before you even reach the third floor unless you get lucky on the layout, as early as the beginnings of the mid-game once you've gotten a few unlocks.

Armor is still 'pass/fail', though the hp pool means a fail isn't always an instant kill. This could be improved but is at least workable, though most armors are useless because they don't cover the 'big three' of blunt/pierce/cut.

Weapons seem to really depend on special ammunition once enemies get armor which is fine but it's very RNG as to whether or not you get a useful ammunition you can make. There is some 'rock paper scissors' here but not much, especially since the more bloated inventory limits what you can carry as a backup.

Inventory is the last major hitch, there's just so much bloat. The economy is an interesting change but there is SO MUCH that is useless or niche, and little/no way to combine things in an approachable way, if you don't get the right chips you're basically SOL, and my attempts at farming chips for blueprints basically resulted in a lot of food items and no chips, despite many corps having high chip drop rates. Could be bad RNG, but I also wasn't finding any in the missions and was careful to avoid causing fires. Inventory bloat is the biggest issue r/n to me.",0

2.

30769,"Play a game of chess with the troll and his own rules.

The game starts with a simple goal of crossing the bridge. However, you won't get too far because a troll is in your way. You can only get to the other side by playing a little chess game. There's no need to panic if you're unfamiliar with the rules. The troll will lend you his rulebook, which includes all you need to know.

Some of the pages are blank, but you can fill them in as you make mistakes. For instance, if you try to move the bishop in a straight line, you'll fail and obtain a new entry in the rulebook for appropriate movement. Also, this is not a real chess match. When the troll puts a bait that you can take with your pawn, you'll be surprised to fail because it's not how pawns behave in this game.

You use a mouse to move pieces around the board. You can pick up anything and position it anywhere, including your opponent's pieces, but this results in an automatic failure. That's why precision is essential. 

Every illegal move is considered cheating. Of course, the troll will try to win by making up some amusing rules. So the pawn may travel backwards, or the troll can move your queen. As long as the regulation is in the rulebook, it is valid.

The goal of the game is to play a normal round of chess while calling out the troll whenever he cheats. You accomplish this by selecting the chess piece and the rule that the troll violated. If you succeed, you can cheat yourself on the following turn. This allows you to go straight for the king.

However, there‚Äôs a catch. The troll plays with black chess pieces that have a special rule: once a king (the troll) is taken, another black piece can become the new king. This means the game will continue until no more black pieces remain on the board. 

Since it doesn‚Äôt take long to beat the troll, the game adds loads of achievements that need special steps to complete. Some of them are funny and might even lead to different endings.",1
30770,"I watched a gothamchess tutorial on how to play chess just for this game, and i really loved it! It's like unironically great, whenever the dealer cheats you just go ""hey, mf, what the hell are you doing??"" Plus rules are pretty stupid, but not bad-stupid, which is also cool",1
30771,"Imagine playing chess against a 6-year old who changed a bunch of the rules without telling you, and cheats, but is bound by honor to reward you any time to catch them cheating. Now move to a bridge, turn the kid green and give them horns, and BAM: you're playing King of the Bridge.

Any hope to get further updates?",1
30775,"Short. Feel like I'm done with it after 1h.

But at the same time pretty good.
For 2‚Ç¨ it's well worth it.

It's basically about playing chess against someone who's made up some dumb rules on the spot and occasionally cheats but also sucks bad so you can beat him without cheating at all.

",1

If the game's gimmick catches your eye, then it might be worth the low asking price for a couple hours' amusement.
If you have only a passing interest in the concept, then price aside, it may just not be worth your time.

[hr][/hr]
[b]My Experience[/b]

I beat the troll on my first attempt and achieved the bad ending - it turns out that if even if you only ""cheat legally"" as payback after correctly accusing the troll of cheating, you are still considered to be a cheater in general.

I lost my second game after cheating by misclicking - the punishment for this is the immediate loss of your king.

I got the good ending on my third attempt.

I played a few more games for achievements, and I now have the majority of those currently available. However, for reasons explained later, I've lost interest in seeking the rest.

[hr][/hr]
[b]Complaints, Opportunities, Other Thoughts[/b]

The rulebook never changes. Some rules are obscured until the troll reveals them via his own moves, but the rules are always the same under those mysterious dust clouds on the rulebook pages.

I was hoping that the advertised ""Intelligent Troll AI"" meant that there was a (partially) randomized set of rules, and that the troll might sneakily choose to reveal rules from that set only when it's to his benefit, even though his past moves may have violated the rule while it was hidden. In reality, the rules are constant and the troll obeys them all until he randomly picks a turn to cheat, once every handful of turns.

The troll's AI is actually quite rudimentary. The challenge primarily comes from the need to capture [i]all[/i] of his pieces, as the black crown has a very inclusive line of succession.

To cheat means to freely move a single existing piece, be that yours or the troll's. You cannot swap, promote, or reintroduce captured pieces, nor can the troll. The troll's payback cheat is always to take your king and end the game. Otherwise, his ""unprovoked"" cheats appear to be limited to moving a single piece [i]slightly illegally[/i]. Usually this means a diagonal pawn, a two-step king, a B/R/Q hop, or moving one of your pieces (in a way that would still be legal for you). I have never seen him attempt to move a rook diagonally, a bishop orthogonally, or a knight in a non-L pattern.

(There's another review complaining that it's impossible to win without payback cheating, but you just need to learn the troll's unprovoked cheating limitations. I'm not even good at chess and I won cheat-free on my second-and-a-half try. Global achievement stats show that right now, over a quarter of players have managed it as well.)

You apparently can never get away with your own unprovoked cheating. Whether you cheat subtlety or egregiously, you'll get caught and lose your king every time. There's no mechanic, for example, to track the troll's building suspicion. He interrupts every so often to warn you not to act while he's looking away, but this - like all his commentary - is just flavor text and isn't represented in the actual gameplay. (The troll king piece sadly does not somersault when he discusses somersaulting.)

The silly goose featured in the trailer never interacts with the game. You may summon him to witness your grand victory or embarrassing defeat, but he cannot serve as an ace up your sleeve (or a queen on your board) to turn the tables against dire odds. He is only ever a silly goose.
(Note: There is a... goose-based comedic event, but it's sort of outside the actual gameplay. The goose may as well be a lily pad, a leaf, or a bubble in this scenario.)

Once you unveil the last rule, that's it. There's some replayability if you're hunting achievements, but beware:
[olist]
    [*]When you win a game, there's an unskippable ending ""cutscene"" before credits roll. If you exit the game before the credits, it puts you back at the beginning of this tedious cutscene.
    [*]The troll cheats frequently, and by cheating he can preclude many of the achievements. Setting up the right conditions for certain achievements thus becomes a matter of endurance - how many times are you willing to restart?
[/olist]

[hr][/hr]
All in all, this feels like an incomplete exploration of an otherwise promising game concept. At the price point, I don't feel [strike]cheated[/strike] ripped off (I feel very cheated), though knowing what I know now, my advice for my past self would be:

The game is fast paces, quick, frustrating but fun anyway. I know some other games that are 'Chess but with a twist'. But this game is one of the best ones. It comes with a fun gimmick that allows you to really enjoy the game. Either as someone who tries to follow the rules, or someone who wants to break the rules.

For this low price, I can only recommend this game!",1
30781,"Game is relatively simple once you get all the rule entries figured out, and for the most part, you unlock them by moving that respective piece a lot, or losing due to ""cheating"", because it doesn't move the way you think it does. 

From a strategy perspective: 
-Pawn has the biggest changes. You can't promote them, they move/capture similar to a rook but only 1 square at a time. This also implies that you can't ""en passant"" or move 2 squares/capture diagonally, and you'll want to advance them at least in a ""buddy system"", where you keep 2 or more close together, no longer forming diagonal rows for protection like in regular chess.
-Knight behaves identically to regular chess, except it's severely less flexible due to how pawns move.
-Rooks mustn't touch, lest they become a useless piece. They can also ""eat"" your own pieces, though that's hardly useful.
-Bishops leave ""landmines"" in the squares they visited, so it's not very practical to keep them inside the game board (yes they can leave the game board now...). They are VERY annoying to capture, especially in cheatless runs, so you can either make sure to prioritize killing them whenever possible, or kill all other pieces, then repeatedly kill the enemy king so the bishops on the outside turn into new kings.
-Queens are less useful, due to 2 new rules added to them, which I won't spoil, but their best use case is to try to snipe enemy pieces.

What I noticed: 
-The troll will never cheat-kill your king, if he kills your king, it's because you left it hanging (there are no checks in this game). 
-He does, however, love to cheat rule 9 and snipe your queen from its' starting position, with his own queen, so make sure to move it diagonally as soon as possible to the 2nd or 3rd rank. If he does this, since your king is now in danger, you can't really benefit from accusing him of cheating, because you WILL have to kill the queen immediately anyway.
-He also often snipes your rooks with his own, but if he does that, you can just kill it with your rook pawn, or accuse him of cheating, grab his rook and drag it ontop of the knight or pawn (if unmoved) beside his other rook. This is probably the biggest advantage you can get by reverse-cheating in this game.
-Apart from blatantly breaking rule 9 with almost every single opportunity he gets, the troll also likes to move things other than bishops out of bounds, move your own pieces, move his pawns diagonally, move his knights diagonally(mostly when capturing), stack pieces ontop of eachother, and when left with few options, his king also sometimes moves 2 tiles. I haven't noticed him using any other cheats in the ~4.5 hours it took me to beat the game.",1
30782,"Thoroughly enjoyed this game. The funny spin on chess and multiple endings are cool, but I really liked the personality put into the game itself. The witty Troll, the rules, and the torn out pages laying around (Would have been a rule against that the evil one if he kept it in).

For those who want the full Rule Book for this game I made a guide [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3198178425]here[/url]. NOTE* IT CONTAINS A LITTLE BIT OF SPOILERS, as these pages are unlocked as you play or accidentally make illegal moves.

I am happy the author/developer of the game is seeing success with their game and the fact it has exploded. I personally have been showing friends and spreading awareness of this game because its cheap and entertaining for the price.

I would like to recommend if there were to be a small update the ability to skip the credits after you win a couple times if possible.",1
30783,It's like playing chess with a little kid who doesn't quite understand how to play. 10/10,1
30784,"This review is specially made for those who like to get all the achievements in games (minor spoilers ahead).

[b]Description:[/b]
King of the Bridge is a short indie, low budget chess game where you play against a troll that makes his own chess rules and each rule page is only revealed after the rule is used or broken. Besides the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù rules the troll also cheats, and if you catch him and point out which rule he broke you cheat to cheat yourself. Cheating or simply breaking a rule you didn‚Äôt know will make you lose the game and restart the match, so prepare to lose a lot of games in the first hours of the game.

There isn‚Äôt a very elaborate story, you‚Äôre trying to cross the bridge and the troll is there challenging you and depending on what you do during the chess match you will unlock one of the four different endings the game has.

The graphics are very simple and basic, made with pixel art and a color scheme that reminds me of the first gameboys with the tones of green and the low screen resolution, but this isn‚Äôt a deal breaker because the gameplay is what the game is all about.

The game is fun to play but until you know the more important rules it can be frustrating at first. After a few hours you‚Äôll start winning your first games and then you can try to get the most difficult achievements. But if you're not going for the achievements the game doesn‚Äôt offer much more than this. There aren‚Äôt new, more difficult enemies, and no new boards, only a few speed chess game modes in the options. It might not justify the 3 EUR price tag but it can still be worth it if you can purchase it with a discount.

[b]Achievements:[/b]  
[b]How many:[/b] 37 Achievements.
[b]How much time:[/b] Around 4 to 6 hours, depending on luck and skill.
[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Easy, once you get used to the new rules.
[b]Achievements‚Äô Difficulty:[/b] Medium. Most of the achievements will pop up after you play a few games and keep trying new things with the chess pieces, but a few will require wiping the save file or adapting your play style, like the juggler, overkill, the great beyond and happy ever after. Still, most aren‚Äôt very hard to get, and here are a few tips to help you, after you have already played a few games:[spoiler]
1 - The best cheat move is to move a rook over another piece next to the other rook, this way they‚Äôll get a castle and effectively lose 3 pieces (this will also get you an achievement). If you can‚Äôt do this just move the rook over a queen or the queen (or another piece) into the holes that the bishops leave.  
2 - The horses are the best pieces to get the stray pawns without vertical or horizontal support. 
3 - You can move your bishops outside the board to attack the rooks if the troll moves the pawn that protects them.
4 - There is no point in attacking the troll too early in the game, just wait until you can capture it without having to sacrifice a piece.
5 - For the speed achievements, set the game mode to the fastest and keep restarting until you finish the game in less than 10 minutes to get all 4 or 5 achievements at once.[/spoiler]


[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  
King of the Bridge is a short indie, low budget chess game with simple graphics but that has a creative and original gameplay. It‚Äôs fun to play but that doesn‚Äôt offer much content besides getting all the endings and achievements.

30785,"Very fun game, albeit not very replayable. Whats important is that you GO INTO THE GAME BLIND! If you know how the game plays out, you're not going to have any fun playing this.

There's probably an hour or two of great fun, with the rest of my playtime being spent grinding out achievements. Given the low asking price, I'd definitely recommend picking up this title.

",1
30786,"for only 3 bucks this game is great. it has fun little jokes, a good amount of weirdness and even 4 endings to unlock. Speedrunning is also very fun.",1
30787,"Check this game out if you like:
- Chess (obviously)
- Puzzles
- Creative spins on old concepts
- Adorable designs and funny writing
- Ducks

You won't regret it!",1
30788,"A genuinely fun twist on chess, from the silly goblin rules to the new ways that some peices move. This is an amazing game for chess enjoyers, and chess noobs. On top of all the cool chess additions, the acheivements are fun and interesting to figure out, so if you like that, definetley give this a try. And if all of that wasn't enough it is so charming, from the funny dialogue to the charming visuals, this game is genuinely cream of the crop, major props to whoever designed this masterpeice.",1
30789,"A very interesting game of chess, as said by another person as if a 6 year old changed the rules of chess, and the game is very addicting, and though a simple idea it is full of many things. my personal favorite thing to do is mess with the black queen.",1
30790,"A smart little puzzle game that doesn't overstay its welcome. The central premise of a game of chess where you have to discover the rules is quite a neat idea, and there's just enough spice and humor for a game of this length. A few of the achievements are a little annoying to get, but they aren't wholly unreasonable.

Overall, well worth the price for the game.",1
30791,"For $3 this game is an absolute STEAL. Its a exciting twist on chess with new rules you learn along the way. Breaking these rules make you lost, but if you catch your troll opponent cheating then you get to cheat back! Loads of fun and a good amount of challenges in achievements to keep you busy for about 5-6 hours! The only downside is that I wish there was a way to quick restart.

I wish there was more because I would play it all immediately, 9.5/10",1
30792,"The only chess game where I might stand a chance against Hikaru Nakamura or Magnus Carlsen.

I highly recommend it, but beware, as your opponent might occasionally cheat!",1
30793,Really fun game with a lot of side content to do. I love the charm and the new rules. Some might find it annoying but I personally really liked it! The multiple endings and achievements makes you come back and try to get all of them. I strongly recommend buying this if you can!,1
30794,"For that generous price and this level of quality, this is a must play if you are a chess fan. It's clever, it's very funny, and it's a genuinely fun chess variant that will require you to think out of the box.",1
30795,"Short game, but great value for the price tag. The twist on chess is fairly unique and fun enough to want to play a few games of it. It was also pretty fun hunting all the achievements",1
30796,"Eu gosto dessa ideia de pegar um jogo j√° estabelecido √© alter√°-lo de forma criativa,
especialmente nesse contexto de ""Eu sou crian√ßa, n√£o sei perder, voc√™ vai jogar conforme minhas regras.""
√â engra√ßado, injusto e eu adoro.

O √∫nico defeito desse jogo √© que acaba r√°pido demais.
A ideia √© divertida, carisma do gameflow tamb√©m...
Pra um jogo de 10 reais foi uma boa experi√™ncia, recomendo.

Maquena eu sou seu f√£ :sob:",1
30797,"A fun experience, especially if you have a friend play and watch their reactions to it for the first time. The game is well-designed and has good comedic timing.",1
30798,"Short but incredibly sweet.

I've never been that interested in chess but the combo of puzzle solving, comedy and weird setting hooked me.

I think there's a lot you could do with taking an established game and completely warping expectations of the rules.

Also what does the duck do? Is he a goose? What does he do?!?",1
30799,"Quite fun, but very very short. I beat it's ""hard mode"" in about two hours. Would love to see this turned into something more, the chaos kicked up by even these few rather hilarious and entertaining rules shows there's a lot of potential in an expanded version. Different scenarios with different rule sets, etc, would be great.",1
30800,"First game I've rated, and man does it deserve it. Best played as blind as possible, this game very much captures how it feels to play chess for the first time. I'm flabbergasted that this game is as poorly known about as it is. An absurdly good deal for it's $3 pricetag, the game's only flaw is it's relative lack of content. However this chess parody has a lot of potential to be expanded upon, both in rules, dialogue, endings (why is there no ending for covering every tile with knowledge?), and with a few minor tweaks, maybe even online multiplayer. I look forward to seeing where this game's development process takes it.",1
30801,"super fun and incredibly good looking game and also one of the few games I've played that has made me laugh out loud plenty of times.

definitely worth picking up if you like chess, trolls or if you're the younger sibling that kept changing the rules of the games you played :]",1
30802,"It is a lot of fun to rapidly explore the clusterfuck how rigged the chess is, and it is quite rewarding for those who like to explore. In the two types of puzzles, one where you are solving and the other you are figuring the rules out, this is mostly the latter. And that is so much fun.
Sprites are cute, story is funny, the effects are well-made.
It is a very short experience, 1-3 hours, but for the price I'd say it's more than worth.",1
30803,"I adore this game. Even after figuring out the rules, troll chess is still at least as fun as regular chess, maybe more so.",1
30804,It's chess but some jerk changed all the rules around and cheats. It's fun to puzzle around and figure out how to beat them despite that.,1
30805,"Fun but very short game, without the achievements, it took me about 40min to beat.
Winning one game of chess against the troll ends the game.
The gameplay loop is playing the game, by which you uncover the rules,
which you can then accuse your opponent of breaking, which allows you to break the rules yourself.",1
30806,"Its a fun, short game that will give you about the same amount of playtime in hours as it costs euro¬¥s. Some pet peeves I have is that some of the rules dont apply, make sense or just do anything interesting in general and that there isnt much incentive to find the other endings because of a lack of direction. nevertheless the first playthrough is hilarious and an unforgettable experience, although the rest of the game could really use some polish.",1
30807,"Cool and funny short game. It was a pleasure to master mechanics and get all achievements. By the way, I strongly recommend to get most of the achievements, because the achievement process reveals the game's most brilliant features.
10 bishop gifts out of 10.",1
30808,"It's a cute, funny little game with a little Inscryption vibe. Will most likely take about an hour to beat the boss, plus a couple of more for completionist. Recommend it!",1
30809,"Fun short experience with replay value.
I really enjoyed exploring the new rules of this game of chess and puzzling my way through it.
I ""completed"" the game in about 1 hour (good and bad ending) but like regular chess there is potential for many replays. On top of that, there are the achievements and speedrun options. I also really enjoy the aesthetics. Juicy animations and nice retro color palette.",1
30810,"it's a short game but worth it for such a low price, it's fun uncovering the rules and catching the troll the first few times but after a few runs you begin to notice patterns in the troll's movements, or when he cheats, and many rules are rarely if ever broken by the troll.",1
30811,"There are so many rules, which is fun to reveal them.
but like there is only 1 single enemy.... 

Completed my first run in 30 minutes..
Good game but too short.",1
30812,"A great little game about chess but with different rules and cheating. Lots of fun though quite short. 

A negative is that sometimes chess pieces can be below some UI elements, making clicking on the right thing difficult.",1
30813,"A good game, takes normal Chess rules and breaks a couple of them in some fun ways that change the game, but it's still Chess at heart. Even does a decent job of teaching you how to think about Chess moves since the bad guy mainly only cheats when you do something that you should avoid doing in real Chess, but when the bad guy cheats you get to call him on it and cheat right back. So it creates a fun back and forth of your bad moves will let you do a really great move also.

Once you want to try to win without cheating you have to really think the game through like a real game of Chess, so it can still scratch that itch of feeling like you're good at Chess.",1
30814,"The real game began once I finally beat that little rascal after almost an hour of being bamboozled by little tricks and traps only to be told I got the 'bad ending,' and upon exiting seeing that I had just under 25% of the trophies...
I've been trolled.
Nice work Schuuuuuring. 
If that is your real name.",1
30815,"Not a lot to it, but price is fair.

A single chess match, except the bridge troll has his own rules and he's not above cheating. Goal is to win anyway, being able to cheat if you caught him doing it.

Some rules are obscured but get revealed overtime and/or when they are broken.

Has four endings but they aren't particularly significant from each other.

There are also optional speed modes where you have limited turn timer, exceeding it making you lose.


I was on the fence about it due to short runtime, but the price is fair and I enjoyed it.",1
30816,"The good:
- Takes heavy inspiration from the sounds, text, and screen transitions of Return of the Obra Dinn. If you've played it, you'll love it.
- Troll hand-rubbing animation never gets old.
- The only version of chess where you get excited about your opponent cheating.

The bad: 
- Couldn't play 1. e4, had to learn the bishop's fianchetto opening.",1
30817,Very interesting puzzle game. The new chess rules makes interesting strategies that don't feel to far off from what could happen in an alternate timeline where chess is different. The only issue is that sometimes the troll will cheat to remove a powerful piece and you don't have a great way to respond even if you cheat back. But honestly the troll cheating is meant to be unfair that is the point of cheating so it fits I guess.,1
30818,"top 5 game of all time for me. it took 47min and 17 attempts and 19 cheats to beat it the first time. i then went and 100%ed the game, walking upward on the bridge for 30min to see if anything would happen. as someone who loves normal chess this **** is hilarious. 

If your someone who is decent at chess and loves r/anarchy chess PLEASE play this game you wont regret it.",1
30819,"It's dope. I didn't even buy the base game :P 

Can hear 5 of the tracks @ https://soundcloud.com/royalteague/sets/cantata-original-music-from-the-video-game",1
30820,Some pretty damn good tunes!,1
30821,"I learned after finally starting Iris off on her own that standing in the back row and summoning your spirit directly in front of you to tank every attack for the first few fights is *the bomb*. After that, it was more a question of building around her spirits taking hits than anything else, and I finally got my first win that way.

Here's the skinny: Iris has several character-specific events to complete in order to unlock new spirits as she goes, and you'll need to start figuring out your strategy (like moving her to the back row so you can summon in front of her) from basically the word go in order to get the most out of her. Until you do, the mid game is going to be pretty tough. I'm still learning strategies, but even more so than the other DLC Characters I believe she's worth checking out and playing around with. I don't know if she's capable of randomly showing up in other campaigns, but based on how the game shifts around her I strongly suspect not.

At this price she's worth getting, ESPECIALLY considering what other companies seem to think is worth charging for paid DLC, and I doubt you'll regret picking her up even if you don't end up playing her long enough to max out her experience bar. I'm happy to have played her campaign, and will again soon!",1
30822,"In the DLC's current state I cannot recommend it. The character seems cool and the design is interesting but the
starting deck is intolerably bad. With the inclusion of the basic deck's blocking cards and the hero specific blocking cards it is
very difficult to deal any damage to the opponents. Leading to multiple turns just having to sit there and slowly die as you cannot deal any damage. This is especially true with status dealing bosses and enemies such as Spitter who I have lost several runs to as I was unable to deal any damage over multiple turns due to the excess of blocking cards in the deck. The character would be a lot more fun if the basic blocking cards were replaced by the character specific ones.

Update: With the adjustment having made with the blocks the character now plays significantly better than before and I would now recommend it.",1
30823,"Insanely strong (and really fun to use) character with cool and interesting scenarios. If you liked the base game, but want some more - give Iris a try.",1
30824,Definitely the most creative addition to the cast yet. Using spirits on their own or to possess party members is a lot of fun.,1
30825,"Iris is hands down the best DLC character ... and probably the best character in the game. Period.

You start off with +1 companion (if you want, but I think you should) and 1 spirit. At first this is pretty slow, but depending on a bit of luck and intelligent pathing, you will soon get more spirits with even more powerful effects. Iris's spirits can basically take up the entire battlefield if you want them to.

At the end I just had my trusty Weasel (the 2nd strongest character, but kinda required, since Iris herself isn't damage heavy) and a mouse for some additional support and just breezed through the final fights with Warden, Spymaster and Prince. Her spirits are so overwhelming when used correctly that there is almost no danger, unless enemies move you or attack through your spirits, which is very rare.

Also the only character I've bothered using Ruin centric cards with, since by unlocking spirits you automatically get Ruin cards you can't get rid of anyway.

And she's just a ton of fun to play, the new scenarios are nice as well. Good job on this one!",1
30826,"The new character is fun, I purchased all DLC to support the developer, but please make the hero from DLC be able to change weapons and armors like normal character. Forbit that just took away a lot of the fun.",1
30827,"It's OK. its like a better scaling version of beaver, your spirits take infinite damage as blockers and its duration is by turns not lifepoints, but you only start with 1 spirit and gain more (with some negative effects sometimes like ruin) spirits as you progress the campaign.

id recommend for ppl that play the game regularly. its better than the powdermaster DLC which i didnt like since it didnt allow you to party with other team members right away.",1
30828,"The final DLC to one of the best deck-builders of all time. If you love deck-builders, get this game and all its DLCs. You won't be disappointed. I hope one day they make Banners of Ruin 2.",1
30829,"This is a cool DLC that adds quite some flavor to the base game. Iris gives the game a couple of cool twists and it was fun to explore the new strategies.

However, as of now the DLC still needs some fixes here and there. I came across a couple of bugs (moving of the spirits, life-spawn of the spirits and once I was just stuck and could not play any cards nor complete my turn) which I assume can be fixed more or less easily by the devs. 
In terms of balance I had the feeling that it is a bit too easy if you just chill in the back row and spawn your spirits in the front row - every enemy will just attack the spirits and you can just kill the enemies without taking damage. 

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the game and can only recommend it to players that liked the game base  - especially given the fair price!",1
30830,"Great flavor and events from this DLC- My main complain though would be how your spirits can be moved by enemies, which can just completely fuck you over. Also, I got to the end of the run and was still missing two spirits- I didn't see any events I missed. Also, it appears I got a talent card that specifically works with one of the spirits supposely from the end at the very start, so it was just a meh card because of it

But for the price, it's a good pickup",1
30831,I regret buying this DLC for Banner of Ruin; ever since I got it i've encountered half a dozen bugs that make the campaign unwinnable due to the game not responding to any actions or because the entire hand of cards was unplayable and could not be discarded due to the DLC's Ancient Amulet which forced me to repeatedly end my turn until the party died. Save your money and skip this broken mess of an add-on.,0
30832,"very pleased with this new dlc, cheap and alot to see with GORgious art",1
30833,"In my opinion a very bad and puzzled decision to create this new ""hero"" mode with strange limitations (e.g. cannot change weapons and armor) instead of just adding a new character to the base game",0
30834,A fresh spin on the game and my favourite of the BoR DLC,1
30835,"Im astonished - Great DLC including a great and complex character that mixes the gameplay up a lot, while being more than fairly priced at release. Instantly bought and enjoying it greatly so far.",1
30836,"Support any more of banners of ruin, great game, hope more fleshed out story content will be added in the future.",1
30837,Very fun character with a unique playstyle.,1
30838,"This is actually just a demo, a lot of stuff is locked. It should be included on its main page instead of as its own game.",0
30839,"Copypaste of Vampire Survivors with bad visual style (looks and feels like a mobile port) and horrible weapon mechanics. For example glaive attacks in the direction of movement, which makes it hard to intentionally hit anything and most attacks happen uncontrollably while you are evading zombies - and does low damage. Smg fires at closest enemy, but since character rotation speed is finite, shots usually chaotically spray from left to right and vice versa as the current target changes without attacking any rational target.

Played 1 hour just for the sake of getting some fun from money spent, but didn't have any. ""sunken cost fallacy"" it is called. 

Edit:
Oh, but then I looked, the game is free. Well, no money was spent, that's liberating (while it shouldn't be)",0
30840,"Although the game gets repetitive extremely fast, I wanted to try to level up my character and unlock the skill points.
But then, if you use the same character too much, it gets debuffed severely and it has to stay in infirmary, so you need to switch to a different character in order to continue playing.
I was already questioning myself if I wanna continue playing this game, and that was the final straw",0
30841,"FatalZone: Outbreak
pros:
//fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on
cons:
//some difficult battles
//unlocking skills takes a long time
//can't aim (the game auto attacks for the player)

//good game
Personal Suggested Purchase Price: Free To Play",1
30842,i enjoyed the demo for the most part but got really irritated by the fact the ultimate shotgun was way worse then the normal shotgun,1
30843,"The concept is interesting, but the gameplay becomes excruciatingly annoying after a while. It has potential, but it needs significant improvements to maintain player engagement",0
30844,Loved running around with different zombies. Good fun when you're bored with work.,1
30845,The prologue of this game is very fun. The theme is set against the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. We manage our own base and strive to survive in this apocalyptic world. Loved it,1
30846,"Absolutely I am not playing many games like this but I totaly liked it. Like the visual style which is awesome nice and original, I like the RPG elements and leveling its overall fun it is enjoyable and for the price the joy and fun its good combo :) music good as well ... Really well made Like it .",1

30849,"Really promising demo, permadeath adds a nice twist to the genre, and i like the way hq upgrades work to slowly increase the time you're capable of survivng a run. I will probably buy the full release",1
30850,"A really interesting take on the survivors-like genre. I really like the idea of having a camp where you can recruit new people, locations to upgrade weapons, train new abilities, etc to help you during your next run. it's also cool that you can decide for yourself if you want to extract and when.

The only thing that kinda disappointed me was that bosses don't always drop special loot boxes/ that you don't get cool new ablities only additional weapons.

I am looking forward to playing the full game at some point!",1
30851,"Its similar to Vampire survivors - but I wouldn't call it a straight clone/rip-off. It does a fair amount of its own thing. 

And hey, its a free demo so I'd highly suggest giving it a try. Personally, I'd highly recommend it.",1
30852,"great game. comparing it to vampire survivors, it holds up great. even better in many aspects. but this demo version is killing me man. i need you to put in the object that fuses with the ksarigami ball chain thing. i need that evo combo available. please man send that item out first.",1
30853,"I played about 30 hrs now and can say its the average RPG top down shooter, i Hope there will be some additional content released with the full version, don¬¥t get me wrong at this point, its a neat little game to spent some time on, i would pay about 10-15 ‚Ç¨ max for it since its not very original but yet quite fun",1
30854,"Honestly enjoying it, lots to upgrade and do (although you unlock everything pretty fast in the demo).  Pretty fun, but melee starting classes kind of stink.",1
30855,"An Exciting Preview of Fatalzone: Outbreak

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

I had the privilege of getting an early look at the upcoming auto shooter, Fatalzone: Outbreak, and I must say, it's shaping up to be a promising addition to the world of gaming. While I can't provide a final verdict, here's a preview of what I've experienced so far.

First off, the graphics in Fatalzone: Outbreak are nothing short of impressive. The attention to detail in the game's post-apocalyptic setting is commendable. The environments are richly textured, and the character models look realistic. The lighting effects and animations contribute to the immersive experience, creating a world that feels truly lived-in and post-apocalyptic.

Gameplay-wise, the auto shooter mechanics add a unique twist to the traditional shooter genre. The controls are intuitive and easy to grasp, making it accessible for both casual gamers and seasoned shooters. The auto-aim feature simplifies aiming, allowing players to focus more on tactics and strategy. However, it's worth noting that this mechanic might not appeal to hardcore shooter fans who prefer manual aiming for precision.

The variety of weapons and gear available in Fatalzone: Outbreak is promising. Customization options for your character and weapons appear to be robust, adding depth to the gameplay. Experimenting with different loadouts and strategies keeps the experience engaging and enjoyable.

The storyline, from what I've seen, has potential. It sets up an intriguing post-apocalyptic world with its own unique lore, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it unfolds as the game develops further. The characters, while not deeply explored in the preview, have the potential to become engaging figures in the narrative.

One thing to keep in mind is that the preview build I experienced had a few bugs and optimization issues, which is common for early access or pre-release versions. However, I'm confident that the development team will address these issues before the final release.

In summary, Fatalzone: Outbreak shows a lot of promise as an auto shooter. Its stunning graphics, accessible gameplay, cooperative multiplayer, and potential for deep customization make it worth keeping an eye on. While it's not without its early issues, I'm excited to see how the game evolves and whether it lives up to its potential upon release. If you're a fan of shooters and post-apocalyptic settings, Fatalzone: Outbreak is definitely one to watch.",1
30856,ITS TOO EASY!!!!! but fr its quiet addictive. Too bad lot of the content is locked. Its still worth the try as the game is small and easy to get into. :),1
30857,"although this is only demo, i find myself already clocked for 3.3 hours of gameplay. Multiple class job and multiple class of weapons (although spear in my leased favourite). Unlike any other zombie survivor game where you fight till death and still brings back the loot, this one needs strategy. U dont want to be spending a lot on a character you bought and upgrade only to be mauled and eaten by the end of the day...and you lose all your loots..

Controls are easy enough and not feeling cluncky. Would like to see this on full version.",1
30858,"Super enjoyable game, though I have tapped out due to being unable to progress further without being able to get above the level 3 upgrades due to demo restriction. People need to stop crying about it being a demo, it's free get over yourselves.",1
30859,"I'm not a big fan of this type of games, but I've found this demo kind of satisfying.  
Of course, demo can't show all features, but what is presented quite good. I love evacuation feature, and that character really die if they died during Raid. 
Will see how the game show itself after release.

30863,"The game is pretty fun to play. I loved it more than other vampire-like games thanks to its fresh (to the genre) setting and the base progression. Also, there is a real risk factor which is - if you lose during the raid, you lose the character completely - with all of their progress. So you have to be careful and plan your actions as you can only leave in one piece during evacuation sequences which are pretty rare. There are lots of perks and classes available to make the replayability much better. The style is a combo between comic book style and something like oil painting. I can recommend this over the other similar games of this genre!",1

30867,"Alright, I am flabbergasted at the negatives reviews so far for this nice little demo/prelude to the upcoming full game.

- Someone complains that the game only offers 30 to 40 minutes, but it has a high replay value and there are several unlocks with this FREE demo here.  I'd guess there are actually many hours here in this.  Even still, if the game looks good, what is wrong with 30 or 40 minutes in a FREE demo and how does that constitute a negative review?  God, people are stupid.

- Someone else complains that the game doesn't tell you where the helicopter is and leaves a negative review for that.  Uhhh, the game makes it BLATANTLY OBVIOUS where the evacuation helicopter is with a big arrow on the screen and a timer of how long you have before it leaves.  Again, people are STUPID.. and leaving negative reviews based on their own obvious game ignorance rather than the game itself.  Geezes.

- And again, someone else just left a negative review because every unlockable wasn't available here in this FREE DEMO.  Yet again, STUPIDITY.  Reeeeeeee, why would you ever want or buy their upcoming full game if they gave you everything for ""free"" in this demo!?!?  Ugh, sometimes I am embarrassed to witness the absolutely stupidity other people display in their ridiculously unfair reviews.

------- What I Like about this Demo: --------

- The zombies and enemies have a good variety and speed keeping you on your toes and keeping the game interesting and engaging.

- Very responsive controls and no FPS slowdown no matter how many enemies are on the screen 

- Great variety of pick-up options

- I love the different resources that you collect like components, food, and gold that all help you buy new upgrades from your base

- The base screen is very nice and unique main screen that does will in this particular zombie VS game.  Each building has it's own purpose and upgrades

- LOTS of stats about your gameplay after each wave and every game.  

- LOTS of specs always showing you all abut your current character you are playing and exactly what you're at for damage, protection, movement speed, and much more.


 -------  WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE FULL GAME:  -------

I'd like to see the ability to turn off auto attack and control where you are shooting with your mouse cursor.  Maybe tie this to the right mouse button or the space bar?  ..Sometimes I might want to turn on manual shoot direction control to focus on bosses or faster moving enemies.  More control to the player is ALWAYS a good option in these kinds of games.



THIS DEMO IS SOLID AF..  If you are a fan of VS like games, this is free.  Give it a try and make up your own mind.  I just cannot understand why this demo at this point on its launch day has 3 out of 4 negative reviews that are so unfair and based more on the reviewers own stupidity rather than the quality of what's here now.

I like it and look forward to the full game launching.  ..But then again, I'm not a blithering idiot like the current bashers now.",1
30868,"FatalZone: Outbreak Steam Review #122 By HyPo Jeanuary von Messerschmitt
Rating: 4/10
I read some of the reviews and i agree this should have been a demo on the Storefront and NOT as a prologue and have a separate Steam store page. What is here is quite decent. Combat is fun, unlocking new stuff is fun. 
Mutation and infection and balancing between different classes is nice in terms of adding variety.
The only map this game has is quite basic in terms of design and art direction. The game in my view lacks enemy variety and has a couple of generic enemies which is fine. I don't know why but everything felt done right but empty, like there is something missing everywhere, i get and understand this is a demo version but it's a yikes from me. If this is meant to be like a first impression of sorts. I enjoyed playing the game but can't really see myself spending full price on the game from what i played. Evacuation feature is kinda neat.  So fellas, this feels like a mobile game but in a good rather then a bad way. I don't know what else to say if i am being honest. I think the demo version is quite barren for a demo and lacks enough content to be fun. I am sorry if my opinion is a bit terrible and i hope when i play the full game ,the issues i have are resolved and the pacing of the game and progression save it from it being out right average like this demo version presents the game as. Average and empty. Enough said fellas.",0

30870,"Unfortunately Fatalzone Only has forward shooting with a gun, Meaning you can run shooting forward while being chased by hundreds and not be able to shoot behind you Without turning around and running into the enemies. It does not even shoot at the nearest enemy only forward, How ridiculous is this.. This game is a no unless we get manual Aiming or shooting the closest enemy. Would love to purchase the Fatalzone game But I think I will wait and see and what direction this game takes.",0
30871,"Another Vampire Survivor clone, with more of a upgrade the base type of gameplay as well as character management, weapon/armor upgrades, and an infection mechanic that helps and hinders based on the time in the field. It's not bad, but the retail release might be overpriced. Time will tell.",1
30872,"Day 1: First character had a uzi...wait why is he missing every single shot?
Day 2: I underestimated the crafty zombies, they've gotten to the dev team who are now gibbering giblets on a random studio apartments floor...
Day 3: I left a negative review as my final sign of resistance and will be returning to playing ai generated games as at least they tend to work on a fundamental level.

P.S. Not being able to aim is normal in this genre, the automatic aiming and gunning not trying to hit anything is not. Requiring several levels of mobility, which you might skip or not get, to extract was also puzzling.
Everyone starts with armour that makes them attack slower, and the attack speed was slow to begin with...why?
The few ""innovations"" are mashing it with delaying tactics that gate progress from pay2win mobile games, which actively get in the way of an already tedious and annoying gameplay loop.

Play anything else, including the ai generated slop, it is very much fun to play 98% of these.",0

30876,"I think this game has a lot of potential, but right now it feels like zombie-flavoured Vampire Survivors. I would love t see the base-building mechanic expanded and possibly something added to the maps. Rather than having random lootboxes I think it'd be cool to have looting locations, such as houses or cabins set up instead. These would create a need for exploration and create risk/reward kill-zones to add some spice to an otherwise relatively... aimless experience. The achievements unlocking new weapons and items also seems a bit off. We have a base-building mechanic, so it'd be great if that was implemented instead of the achievement-unlocks. Perhaps with building certain buildings or ""tech"" (kind of XCom-style maybe?). For now it's definitely not a BAD game, but it feels a lot like ""just a Vampire Survivors reskin"" and I think it has the potential to be so much more and bring something new to this genre.

EDIT: a lot of the upgrades also fall into the Vampire Survivors-philosophy of just increment stat-ups. But there's a grenade launcher, a frag grenade and shock grenades, perhaps these could be combined into a single upgrade-tree. Start off with the frag grenade and as it maxes out allow the player to pick between the launcher for extra distance or the shock grenades for the stun. Lastly a positive note: I love the extraction mechanic. It allows me to choose how long my run is going to be and bail early if I screwed up.

30888,"I am giving it a recommend based purely on the overall feel of it. The character dialog is pretty cute, the level design is kinda neat in town (though very basic), the dungeon design was kinda average-but-different. I don't know what they will eventually make out of the game, but it has potential. If nothing else, it's a pretty good example of ""up front coolness."" With the dialog and characters, the vibe reminds me of Maniac Mansion kind of (even though you're only playing one character). If they end up adding more unique dialog/interactions for the individual townspeople and their houses, could be a cult classic. But I still like the vibe.

I should mention that the combat is very very very VERY picky early. Basically, you gotta wait until there in one square between you and the enemy, the you gotta jump the last square so you're right next to them and attack right away, then you gotta jump away if you don't want to get hit. Not so hard with one enemy, but get a few around you and it gets to be a chore.

Dunno if it changes later, since I am only playing this every once in awhile, but it's not horrible so long as you follow the pattern. At least one enemy has had a different movement pattern as well, which makes it tricky.

You can also just run past stuff, but then you lose out on drops. Combat also feels like more of a puzzle, which is better or worse depending what you like. It does not feel like a Zelda clone, since you basically get your butt kicked if you just jump on enemies. That could be a positive or a negative, depending how you want to view it.

To do well, I recommend playing it, getting the pattern down, and then watching the preview video for the game on the store page. You'll be like ""AHHH so that's how I don't die.""",1

I lost a page along the way, but I'm definitely playing it again to snag that missed page.

However, I suggest you to optimize the game a bit more in the next updates. 15GB is a lot. I also think the page collection system could be improved, as well as the options and inventory. Also support to other languages would be great and would increase the sales significantly.

Solid 10 for the hard work, dedication, love, and the great end result.",1
30899,"This is a great game. I was impressed that this is the first game made by just 3 people who recently started studying development. 

Pros: The graphics are beautiful. Seriously. There are loads of Easter Eggs everywhere so make sure you check all the interactions. The gameplay flows well, and the story is based on real events, which piqued my curiosity and made me play the game TWICE as I lost two pages in the first playthrough. The environment is rich and every piece of the scenery brings a memory to Adam. The devs putted everything together really well.

Cons: The achievement system isn't working correctly. In my first playthrough I only got 2 achievements. Two pages was missing so I decided to replay it today because I was curious to know more about Adams life and to my surprise the achievements that should have appeared in my first gameplay showed up in my second lol. The flashlight's light is irritating when you reload the weapon it shines too much. Sometimes the sound of picking up ammo is sooooo low that we can't hear it. The game's music could have been a bit more crafted to create a scarier atmosphere with more jump scares. These are minor details that don't ruin the experience, but since I see the devs update the game regularly, here's my tips for future updates.

I recommend this game to everyone who likes history and escape rooms. If you enjoy exploring the scenery to find an exit, this game is for you.",1

Couple of things though: The flashlights kinda annoying when your reloading the gun  and sometimes the sounds off like you cant hear when you pick up ammo or when Adams already speaking and you pick up something like a page its like hes talking over himself saying two things at once which can get pretty confusing. But other than that the games pretty solid.",1

30904,"A Chilling Experience - A Must-Play for Horror Fans!

Rating: 9/10

I've just had the pleasure of playing this excellent horror game, and I must say it's been a wild ride! While I haven't finished the game yet, I couldn't help but take a moment to share my thoughts on what I've experienced so far.

The gameplay is incredibly well-designed, with a keen sense of tension and fear expertly crafted by the developers. The jump scares are expertly timed, making me shriek with surprise more than once! The atmosphere is tense and foreboding, with an eerie soundtrack that perfectly complements the on-screen action.

The sound design is particularly noteworthy. The pounding on the windows, the creaking of doors, and the distant echoes of unknown sounds all come together to create a sense of unease and dread. It's amazing how effectively these sound effects can manipulate your emotions and make you feel like you're right there in the midst of the horror.

The storyline is also well-written, tackling modern-day issues that resonate with contemporary audiences. The game's narrative is thoughtful and thought-provoking, exploring themes that are relevant to our world today. It's a refreshing change from the usual horror tropes and clich√©s, and it keeps me engaged and eager to find out what happens next.

If you're a fan of horror games, do not hesitate to pick this one up. It's a masterclass in building tension and suspense, and it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Even though I haven't finished the game yet, I'm already eager to see how it concludes.

Recommendation: If you enjoy horror games with a strong focus on storytelling, atmospheric sound design, and modern themes, this game is a must-play.",1

30927,"So the concept of this game is neat, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The game is designed around the idea of making your way up an obstacle course full of difficult jump puzzles and punishing you by effectively restarting you if you mess up, which can be rather frustrating if you are a ways in and happen to make a mistake. Fine, whatever, people are into that.

The issue with this game is that, despite clearly being put together with a bunch of pre-made assets (no hate on folks that choose to do that - it's more than I've done), there are a number of frustrating bugs that can effectively ruin a person's run. Having played for a number of hours, slowly progressing through the game, My fellow players and I have noticed a number of issues, most notably:

-Improperly placed assets make it so your character doesn't grip a ledge they are supposed to, or instead decides to kick off the asset instead of climbing it.

-Character randomly slides left or right when climbing, occasionally leading the player to ultimately stand on open air, 
 or on a tilted ledge, resulting in a fall

-Inconsistent player controls. Occasionally, your character will overrun instead of stopping, though it is not consistent. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the character stops after a jump, sometimes, they kick off the surface into a second jump. Sometimes, you have pretty full control of your character in the air, other times, your character simply will not move while in the air.

-Character not responding to commands. For example, sometimes (okay, a bit more often than sometimes), upon attempting to jump, your character simply forgets how to jump.

-Player gripping inside of objects, instead of the surface of those objects.

-Invisible walls, particularly toward the later portions of the game. At one point, I came across an arcade, and seeing quite clearly where I was supposed to go, my character just kept getting stopped by invisible walls. There was no proceeding straight toward my destination; I had to move back and forth around an invisible obstacle course just to reach the end of the sidewalk, where upon jumping on a bed, my character was forced into another invisible wall that felt like a cage I was forced to push myself out the side of to try again, only for the same result - and yes, this is where I was supposed to go. I was not out of bounds. The assets simply haven't been refined.

-And finally, the most frustrating of all, which we've seen a number of times; the character getting stuck in an endless jump animation, unable to move at all, forcing the player to have to go into the game's  menu and ""restart,"" placing you at the beginning.

Look, I'm all for games that choose to punish the player for their mistakes, but when it's been fine-tuned to the point where it doesn't feel like the player's mistake was simply paying to own a copy of the game. Until the bugs are worked out, there should at least be a mode that allows the player to reset back to a saved point.

And what I find the most ridiculous here is that the game's ""training mode"" is locked behind completion of the game itself. What?

So again, I understand and appreciate the concept, but there's a lot to be desired as far as the execution goes before I could personally recommend folks buy this title. I'm sure I'll get through it eventually (I'm simply happy my brother managed it after 13+ hours), but one should not have to work around a series of bugs and glitches screwing them and rely on a hope and a prayer in order to actually finish the game.

At the very least, until they either open access to training or offer a mode that allows save points, I cannot and will not recommend it.",0

They separate the route into different dlc so if you don't buy them , you can't even pick any route or option you wanna go.

Nice but too pricey for a Low Budget Eroge Visual Novel
The prices of the game and DLC doesn't make much sense at first.
24.99 Base Game

15.99 DLC
12.99 DLC
9.99 DLC

I mean the base game has 2 girls for 12.50usd per waifu but the DLCs are at 29.00usd for both waifus?
I thought this was pretty awkward since the DLC both cost more than the base game at 14.50usd average per waifu.  I believe the game over at DLSite has all content in one purchase.  BUT THE CATCH IS the game was 6,490Yen which is 43.37usd.
Basically the devs chopped the game into separate pieces and you may choose your Poison.  The base game is quite Vanilla while the DLCs go into the WalkInThePark and SCAT categories.  I felt this was somewhat thoughtful for people to just get the base game at a cheaper price and avoid SCAT / ParkWalks because there are probably a good few that aren't into that sort of thing.

In conclusion, if you buy the bundle you'll be paying similar to the price over at DLSite but with an MTL English translation.  At the least you can understand the scenarios though it wasn't professionally translated.",1

This game scared the living crap out of me.  I got a mediocre ending after getting a slightly happy one.  The backgrounds and the monsters are truly amazing.  The story is really scary and really fascinating.  The story is very unique.  The price is wonderful.  It is about 2 to 3 hours for under four dollars and it's a great buy.  I was immersed but not obsessed - I've been playing games for so long I can't really get immersed but I was invested.  I recommend Steam games Stella of the End, Akyths, Ceiba, the anime Here and There Then and Now, and Slay the Princess game.  This game is a true gem.  The plot alone is compelling enough but the truly outstanding visuals and extraordinarily immersive sound effects make for a true horror VN masterpiece with no puzzles (I like it that way - I am a VN lover).  Oh I can't figure out the Happy End yet but I'll try again tommorrow because I am emotionally drained from the rollercoaster of emotional turmoil.   It's extremely scary so be warned.  The hero is a sweetheart, a true hero, before the story begins, in the middle, and at the end.  I liked the Native American characters - that made it more interesting to me - horror should have diverse characters like any other genre.  Also, try Entropic Float - this is like that too just spiritually but Entropic Float is more realistic and moderate horror but this game are spiritual horror game cousins.",1

After finishing this game it surpasses my expectations with many original ideas, bringing something new to the table and not relying on tropes and clich√© we're used to to seeing. Making the whole playthrough a horror game compact with mystery and suspenseful moments thanks to the audio design making realistic sounds like heart beating and deep breathing to help make the situation tense.

My 2 main requests to make this game better are to have more save files (maybe 3 extra), and more sound audio variation as it started to become noticeable those that were being reused often. Other than that, this was a solid game you should play for something imaginative and rooted in making the players expose multiple choices to undercover some answers to a question lurking around.

30982,"[quote][b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/b]
""Music Man 2: New land"" is a Digital Homicide style asset flip, or what Valve calls a ""Fake Game"". The ""developer"" paid for/pirated a few Unreal Marketplace packs, dumped them all in a blender, and submitted it to Valve as if they're real game developers.[/quote]

Two notable criteria for what makes an asset flip instead of legitimate use of stock assets are whether those assets comprise the majority of the game, and whether the ""developer"" properly credited the people who created most of the assets in the game.  This game fails both of those tests.  The ""developers"" here didn't credit any of the artists and real, actual game developers who created the assets here, so this is plagiarism, as well as cash grab shovelware.

In this case, the asset flipper took a bunch of random assets from the Unreal Marketplace and dumped them onto a basic Unreal platformer blueprint with next to no other effort expended.  It's a fake game like all of Tero's other asset flip scams polluting the Steam store and giving indie devs a bad name.  It has no value or merit as a real game.

Tero Lunkka/Valkeala Software have shown a repeat pattern of unethically dumping other people's work onto Steam as a cheap, nasty cash grab, through this account or through closely linked/alt accounts.  Here's some examples so you can see for yourself:

Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the 1990s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.  

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

""Music Man 2: New land"" didn't appeal much to the people who own a copy of the game, either.  It has achievements, and they show us a very clear picture that the game didn't really capture any interest from gamers.  The most commonly and easily attained achievement is for going through the first ""level"" of this asset flip, trivial to get, but less than 35 percent of players bothered to get that far before uninstalling the game.  Hardly a success story, gamers just weren't all that interested in the game.

The poor quality of this game is also reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 3 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 100,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

It's also important to note the ""developer"" here has connections to a number of shady Russian asset flippers and review manipulators who show an organised pattern to scam and defraud gamers with fake reviews and asset flipping the work of others for profit.  While reviews are about the games, gamers should be informed when developers act unethically.   Whether these connections are the same developer using multiple accounts, or just working closely with other unethical developers, gamers should be warned about the harm to gamers by this developer and their associates.  Buying games from unethical developers puts your money at risk.

This game features a small number of fake positive reviews from accounts known to be in the business of review manipulation/paid reviews.  They're all written in either Russian or broken English, appear at almost exactly the same time, very shortly after the game launched on Steam, all have a direct Steam purchase of the game, and the accounts are used consistently to write fake reviews for asset flips and other cash grabs/scams.  The ""Positive"" review score on this game should be disregarded due to this blatant, unethical review manipulation.  This is done to deceive and scam gamers into paying for a bad product.[/quote]

This kind of asset flipping isn't harmless.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games from ethical developers.  It makes it harder for genuine indie developers, who put hard work into trying to make real games, to find an audience for their products.  It gives indie developers a bad name.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

""Music Man 2: New land"" is relatively cheap at $3 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Remember that if you buy a game from an unethical developer, you're putting your money at risk.

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.[/quote]

30983,"Hi.
Today I'm going to tell you about a strange but far from bad adventure game. 3D graphics of this indie game are average, geometry and shaders are the big minus of the game. Also there is absolutely no balance of enemies - hit from afar, while you reach him - you die. Nice music, easy controls.... But, unfortunately, it is extremely unclear - why there is no pause in the game? By habit you press Esc to pause the game, and it turns out that you leave the game!

This game is so addictive, I can't stop humming the tunes even in my sleep!

30996,"Square Word: Back to Work! is developed by CCS (Cold Coffee Studio)

A colorful word game in a Wordle type environment, where the player will be searching for appropriate words according to the category. At the bottom of the grid are several blank squares of varying amounts. It's up to you to figure out individual words related to the current category. The tricky part is that some words may have different directional possibilities so even though the word may be correct, it's possible that you have chosen the wrong directional path and it may leave letters that can't be connected. 

The player will go through 4 difficulty levels in the course of the game, beginning with Easy to Very Hard. Each of the 4 categories (Sports, Jobs, Places, Autumn) include the following puzzles:

* Easy 3x3 puzzle-5 Levels
* Medium 4x4 puzzle-4 Levels
* Hard 5x5 puzzle-3 Levels
* Very hard 6x6 puzzle 4 Levels

As the player progresses through the game, they will be rewarded with in game Stamps which can be redeemed for Hints. There is an option of 2 kinds of Hints-First Letter or the entire Word. Earn 1 Hint for every objective completed or earn 1 word Hint for every 3 objectives. If more hints are required, there is an envelope that drops down from the top of the main menu, and if clicked, will grant the player 1 Hint. The difficulty level progresses the further you go.

There is also a daily challenge (with a timer) to complete, and if successful, will grant you 1 Hint.

Pros:
* 140+ Words to find
* Handcrafted grids
* Music complements the game
* Daily challenge
* Hints
* 12 Achievements

Cons:
* The sporadic drop of the envelope in the main menu to grab 1 Hint in an effort to proceed takes sometime to drop
* No trading cards

Final Thoughts:
Would be a great game for co-op if developer decides to implement it in the future. This is kind of a difficult game and quicker hints would be nice. Or it could just be me. The price is reasonable for what you get and is currently on sale, so even better value.

Rating: 7/10

30997,"[h1]WAY MORE CHALLENGING THAN ITS PREDECESSORS[/h1]¬†
Square Words is a game that requires you to make themed words from various-sized grids of letters. You can create words horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, and in most cases, it's a combination of all 3 directions.

There are four categories: Sports, Jobs, Places, and Autumn. Each category has three Easy 3x3 grids, three Medium 4x4 grids, and three Hard 5x5 grids. (The words do seem to change each time you replay.) There is also a Daily Game and a Mixed 6x6 category in a Very Hard mode.¬†¬†

At the bottom of the grid are several blank squares of varying amounts. It's up to you to figure out individual words related to the current category. The tricky part is that some words may have different directional possibilities, so even though the word may be correct, it's possible that you chose the wrong directional path because it may leave letters on the outer edges that can't be connected, and you'll have to restart the level.

There are two different Hint types. The Letter Hint fills in the first letter of one word. The Word Hint gives you the answer to the word, but it's still up to you to figure out the directional path. Additional Hints can be earned by playing the Daily Game, completing an entire category, or completing Achievement Stamp objectives. You will earn 1 hint per objective, such as completing one Daily Grid game. Word Hints are earned when you complete three of these objectives. You can also ""catch"" a hint by clicking on the Envelope that drops down from the top of the main screen (which is also an achievement x5)

I did find this game to be more challenging than the last two games. In my opinion, it was more challenging to figure out the correct words in some of the categories because the words didn't seem to fit the category, were slang words, or incomplete words.

[h1][b]POSSIBLE SPOILERS[/b][/h1] For example:

Under the category [b]JOBS[/b], a Nun is considered a job (I consider it a ""calling"" or a ""community service"") Cop is used in one puzzle and Police in another, which is inconsistent at the very least. A ""Star"" is considered to be a job. I understand that you can be a star employee, but that seems more like a status than a job to me?¬†

Under the category [b]PLACES[/b], ""Sun"" is considered to be a place, which seems a bit of a stretch.

Under the category [b]SPORTS[/b], apparently, ""Volley,"" (not Volleyball) is a sport. I Googled ""Is Volley a sport?"" and the closest I came to connecting Volley to a sport was a definition for Tennis: [i]The flight of the ball before it hits the ground. The return of the ball before it hits the ground.[/i] I also encountered the word ""Summerset,"" which is an acrobatic feat in which the feet roll over the head (either forward or backward) and return. Technically, these words [i]are related[/i] to sports, but they are technical terms, and I don't think the average Joe would be able to make these connections...but I could be wrong.
¬†
The bottom line is that I still enjoyed the game, just not as much as the previous two games, because I had to use all of my hints when I couldn't figure out these vaguely related words. I even had to grab extra hints on the main menu just to get through the Sports category, and that took away from the enjoyment of the game overall.

30998,"Cute game, but quite easy.  Took 65 minutes to complete all puzzles 100%.  Would definitely wait for a 75% off or more sale on it.",1
30999,"An engrossing, challenging, fun game! I can't believe I got 100% so it is a very satisfying game too!",1
31000,So this is an interesting word game. Similar to the Wordle games on Steam. Decent enough.,1
31001,"Stacks:Jungle is the latest release from the developer of Stacks:Space. It is a card-based strategy village builder with exploration and crafting. It is similar to Stacklands and Card Survival Tropical Island in style and game play, but Stacks:Jungle brings more variety and complexity to it's crafting recipes and greater detail and maturity to its visual motif. If you are a fan of card-based games I recommend Stacks:Jungle and if you see it on sale then don't hesitate. If you would like to take a closer look then check out my let's play series on YouTube: https://youtu.be/0pzH_L6kow4?si=pQ9l_zbyf27ihwRZ",1
31002,"Initially I liked it, and thought it just needs some balancing/polishing. 
But right now I have a savegame-breaking but when going from on place to the next. So probably will refund.

Some thoughts, comparing it to Stackland:
- Timing seems of. I only played with speed 1, and paused frequently, because speed 1 felt to fast to micromanage everything that is needed
- Cards produced land everywhere around, instead of stacking on an existing stack of the same card right next to them
- unlocking the research stuff feels chaotic (because it is to easy/fast)
- You overproduce coins in some places, and then just burn through them in other places -> needs better balancing
- You never ""scale up"" your people , you go from 1 person to 2 pretty soon, plus a parot who can one tiny thing
- Drops of leaves, which you need to increase your card limit, seem pre-scripted to stop?
- On the positive side: I like not fighting enemies.",0
31003,"Stacks: Jungle! is not just a game; it's a journey into a world of endless possibilities, where the thrill of stacking cards transforms into an adventure through the vibrant, untamed landscapes of the jungle. For a card-stacking experience that seamlessly blends simplicity, strategy, and creativity, ""Stacks: Jungle!"" is a must-have addition to your Steam library.

5 hours simply melted away as I worked my way through the first three areas. I'm almost done with them, and looking forward to finding the next 20-odd places.  There's MANY hours of game play here, and an enjoyable change of pace from FPS and RPGs.

(I was gifted this steam key in a Reddit giveaway, no additional compensation was given for reviewing)",1
31004,Its a fun little game but too peacefull unlike the rest of stacks games. Would like to see more of stacks games with diffrent themes and challenges.,1
31005,"pretty chill and nice game to play if you like crafting and exploring with many good ideas.
i think it needs some QoL features :)",1
31006,"Stacks:Jungle is a cool new survival game played out totally with cards. It's apparently inspired by Stacklands but I haven't played that so I went in open-minded. Starts simply but it's actually quite big - huge map to explore, tons of recipes to discover. Very well thought out.

Stacks:Jungle starts as a relatively generic survival game (craft tools, gather food, build a hut and boat) except with cards. However, it really opens up when you start exploring new islands. Fun!

31007,"Fun Card stacking game, lots to explore and survive in Stacks: Jungle!",1
31008,Interesting survivor card game. Worth to try it,1
31009,"Ignoring the complains the game got for removing a single line of text that appears in an optional, out of the way, fake twitter app, this update and DLC isn't really that good. 
     The DLC feels a lot more tacked on than I would have expected and really sticks out as it essentially derails itself from the main plot that every other route follows. It slaps in a whole new villain completely unrelated from the current plot and just runs with it. 

     The DLC also comes with questionable bugs and glitches, for starters an audio bug that would occur if you alt-tabbed from the game is still present and is somehow even worse, as a majority of the game audio will now just cut unprovoked. This was just my experience but the fact it happened on two different setups isn't a good sign. Another frustrating bug that comes up is that during side quests, cutscenes play when the fight on the map ends, normally you would just fight one or two people and then the cutscene plays. But for some reason in just about every side mission in the DLC it keeps spawning random pedestrians who will become aggressive and prolong the fight forever. I genuinely mean this could last forever, I attempted multiple times to fight off the random aggressive pedestrians, the highest I managed to fight was 30 just trying and failing to progress a side quest that should have ended already. I have no clue how a prevalent issue like this fits through the cracks.

     Another issue relating to balancing. One main issue I had with the remaster of the first game was how often you would get swarmed by enemies, and this got taken way out of proportions here. There are multiple fights where you face 4 or more enemies by yourself, sometimes in cramp places. This makes it quite easy for enemies to combo you into each other, managing to kill you without any possibility for your inputs. The final boss is just you fighting 13 enemies at once. These enemies can easily surround you and god help you if they use a move with knock back as they will almost certainly knock you into another enemy as you're pushed around like you're a pinball.

     As for the story I didn't pay that much attention to it but as i mentioned before, it has a main villain almost completely unrelated to the previous story, a magical demon that possessed a family for generations, that is going to be harvested for its evil powers as apparently everyone knows the powers of this random demon that has been locked way for generations. There are also a few notable jumps in logic that violate the idea of common sense say for instance [spoiler] You deciding it would be better off to flee from you friends and get into multiple fights with them, rather than tell them that Kati is possessed by a demon and that she needs help. [/spoiler] or [spoiler] this magic demon created purely by hate, rage, and violence against humanity, suddenly wants to be good and learn to love humans after you beat it twice [/spoiler] 

     Ultimately I have no reason for why this DLC exists, it barely fits in with the main plot, is centered around one of the previously least important characters in the story, and it remains buggy and unbalanced for a game that is now 10 years old. If you liked the normal game then this DLC is worth a shot, but this will not make your experience that much better, all truth it might make it just a little worse.",0
31010,"If your buying Akiba's Trip new, this would fit into the experience well. You wouldn't be missing much if you skipped it but I believe online this is seen as the ""cannon"" ending. What I think it had good arc for a side character",1
31011,"pay $12 for the stereotypical persona 4 jrpg defeat god with the power of friendship ending

it's not anything special but some of the jobber villains get their redemption arc and it's kinda compelling

Shion still best girl",1
31012,"It's good BUT it's pushing away some potential playerbase due to a swarm of info dump way too fast.

I play Yu-Gi-OH and Magic and various other card games with a lot of text and complicated interactions but this game despite having less information dump than the other 2 specific card games mentioned, has a massive information on par with a TCG Rulebook while not including decent information that can cause confusion all because everything important and key to the game is info slammed in a poor raw text format all at once.

What can be done to improve this?
Easy. Just slow down the info injection mind flaying. Ease the information to when we encounter it rather than throw it all at us before we even can actually care about it.

Dismantling stuff? don't care until I actually need to.

Forge and signs? Why are these even being shown to new people when we should't/can't do anything about it yet?
Just make it hidden until necessary like greying it out and replacing it with the text of when we can/should access it. That would give the player less info dump at the very start and give them something to look forward to o new players get a feeling to work to earn something to increase their first play session of the game.

The tiny some-what hidden encyclopedia icon at the top left?
Hide all information in it until we need to care about it and have the information on it show up ""WHEN"" we encounter it for the first time. At which time, the information of that should pop-up mid-game.
Makes the book a ""Reminder"" menu.

Small Information isn't even provided as well which can confuse people only because the game drops a fat load of important information way too fast which causes the rather minor details that aren't really needing a info mention to overwhelm people before they give it a proper try causing a pointless barrier to entree that most new card game devs tend to overlook specifically because card game devs tend to have a basic understanding of card game logic. However, slowing down how much information is given at once and slowing it down a little bit helps a lot wit getting new players into the game especially in a world where currently people don't really give much time to try anything and tend to quit forever after 5-10 minutes at most usually.

In short, slowing down on the info dump and preventing people from seeing certain information when it isn't yet necessary nor even seen yet will greatly improve how long new players, including those not used to in-depth card games or card games in general will stay active playing the game while also increasing the playtime of their first session if forge, signs and info in the Manual were hidden as to give them a sense of early-meta progression all from a single first run.",1
31013,"In the current state, I can't recommend this game. 
The game is pretty that's for sure but I don't really care too much about that..
The gameplay feels like it's all over the place. It's perfectly fine to add a lot of different mechanics, it's even needed in order to reach a nice depth and replayability but the current mechanics don't play well with each other so it just feels like a messy patchwork.
There is way too much meta progression - which is arguably a personal preference so maybe it's your thing.
Also, hopefully only an EA issue but the balance is off, I didn't lost a single hit point in my run until I got obliterated by the boss.",0
31014,"This game is amazing. I have only played two hours thus far, gonna update review later.
Still, I can already see the depth and variety that will be possible down the road. Even playing such a short amount I can feel my cards becoming much stronger. 

I love the customization aspect. You can not only create your own deck but also every! card in it like you wish. If you like deckbuilders, rougelikes, figuring stuff out and optimizing this is for you. 

Looking forward to play much more :).",1
31015,"Nice ideas with the custom card building. Nice anime portraits as well, even though I really hope to get the option for custom portraits.",1
31016,"Highly recommended!!
I immediately bought it after playing the demo for an hour!

It's well worth the money. So basic, yet so much fun.
Graphics could potentially be better. However, considering the pricing and coming from an indie developer, This is not bad at all.
I see potential for an interesting variety of character development, team composition, and game play.

31017,"Had the game for a while but for some reason not got round to doing a review. 

This is a really good game overall, pretty well balanced, able to do alot of customisation, although a few systems could probably do with slightly better tutorials, EG 40 hours into playing and only just found i can stop certain elements from appearing on champs and reward runes. 

don't think iv'e had 2 runs the same yet. Would highly recommend. Honestly well and truly worth ¬£10",1
31018,"This is a fantastic find, very in depth with all the upgrades and the re-playability is huge given all the different combos you can do on the upgrades.",1
31019,"Great game, a steal for less than 10‚Ç¨ ! 
It's the roguelike deckbuilder of my dreams, no other deckbuilder I know (and I tried most) allows you to customize/change every single card this deeply. 
You can have up to 4 runes in each card, each rune can add damage/defense/buffs/debuffs or some other effects, making the same base card do completely different things in the end. Depending on the champions class and element the available runes and cards to put them into differ. 
Add Equipment and Artifacts for bonus effects (e.g. one gave my warrior block for each burn applied, making him tanky by being a dot machine), rune and card upgrades and meta progression into the mix and you got your monkey brain hooked.  
I sometimes spent hours between fights, just crafting the perfect cards for each of my 5 champions to combo into each other. 
Each fight also lets you choose one of many additional challenges for bonus rewards, making each fight a bit different.   
  
The game even has a demo, just try it!   
  
Edit: I feel like I need to add that the game is still rough around the edges with bugs, I had one Artifact not even work at all, which made me stop playing for now, because it still feels like early access (which it isn't) with lots of QoL/bugfixing needed.

Although, you have indeed been called.
You have all been called here.
Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune.
A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize.
You don't even realize that you are trapped.
Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles.
Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber.
Always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.

And the memory of everything that started this.
Can finally begin to fade away.
As the agony of every tragedy should.
And to you monsters trapped in the corridors.
Be still, and give up your spirits.
They don't belong to you.
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warm.
Waiting for you after the smoke clears.

The darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole.
So, don't keep the Devil waiting, old friend.

No one was there to lift you up in their arms.
The way you lifted others into yours.
And then, what became of you?

Hope to see some updates and a bit of updates on the game as it has a lot of potential to be a great game. Things I feel need to be added: Sound - game volume needs to work, and music volume should be separate to turn down or on/off. Building - Would like to see more snap features on the fences as there are on the building pieces. More building options, foundation and such. Rotate of the placeables and building pieces with R, so it can be rotated in place. Would love to see the camera of the game be controlled with the mouse so as i turn the camera turns, the Q/E while using WASD is horrible imo. A tutorial would be amazing to see, to explain a bit of what to do, where to build, and how to gather things as this was unclear from the start. Overall do love the game and hope by buying the game this will promote the developer to further progress the game :)",1

Call of Farming is a Unity Asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", Mavi Game Studios, took the [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/survival-engine-crafting-building-farming-178160]Survival Engine[/url] Unity Store tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, Indie Marc, changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... ""Survival Engine"" has also been shamelessly dumped on Steam by other asset flippers apart from Mavi Game Studios:
[list]
    [*] ""[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625800]Hentai in the Forest[/url]"", asset flipped by Boom Games/Sweet Games
    [*] ""[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543820]PaperCraft[/url]"", asset flipped by Cinnamancer Studios
    [*] ""[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623320]Little Big Guy[/url]"", asset flipped by Albatross Idea
    [*] ""[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1507910]Survival Engine[/url]"", asset flipped by Indie Marc (yes, he put his own asset pack on Steam as if it was a real game... ugh). 
[/list]
Take a look for yourself... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

Because this is an almost exact 1:1 copy + paste of the original Unity asset, it's in violation of the [url=https://unity.com/legal/as-terms]Unity Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA[/url].  Specifically, Section 2, Subsection 2.2.1a:

[quote][i]Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, Licensor hereby grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset solely:(a) to incorporate the Asset, [b]together with substantial, original content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store[/b], into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Assets (""Licensed Product"") as an embedded component of that Licensed Product, [b]such that the Asset does not comprise a substantial portion of the Licensed Product[/b][/i][/quote]

Because the developer misused the asset pack such that it comprises the vast majority of this ""game"", the developer has unethically and deliberately breached the license agreement.  Worse, this intellectual property violation was done in an attempt to profit from their illicit actions.  Why is this permitted on Steam?

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Survival Engine"" is just a demo/tutorial pack to teach people how to make a simple top down 3D survival game in Unity, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Now, Mavi Studios have made this ""free"" for now, so they're no longer trying to scam people out of money for someone else's game, but it doesn't change the fact that their original plan was exactly that... to run an asset flip scam on Steam, to scam you out of money for Indie Marc's Unity asset pack.  Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Mavi Game Studios.

[quote][b][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile]Profile Features Limited![/url][/b]
Valve have marked this game as ""Profile Features Limited"" at the time of this review.  This is usually caused by poor sales figures and low community acceptance for the game (to date).  Until this status changes, this game will not give you +1 to your Game Collector badge count, appear in profile achievements or any other Steam meta-accomplishments, nor can it be displayed in some profile showcases.  If these factors are important to you, it may be worth holding off before buying this game.[/quote]

[quote][url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews]Developer Response![/url][/quote]The developer has weighed in to inform everyone they didn't read the [url=https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews]Developer Usage Rules[/url] for Steam ""partners"", or they deliberately ignored the part where Valve says:
[quote]Though it may be tempting, not every review needs to be responded to.  A developer response will frequently draw more attention than the original statement, potentially turning a small issue into a much larger community discussion. It's also not a good idea to use this feature to refute customer opinions. Your direct attention can be seen as validation or a defensive attempt to silence your customers.[/quote]

So this is insane... the developer breached Valve guidelines just to brazenly acknowledge [b]this is an asset flip[/b].  They don't see that's a problem, instead, they decided to argue with me, a reviewer, about what the Unity Terms of Service says.  You know, the one that they agreed to and then immediately breached, so they can profit from dumping asset flip trash on the Steam store.  I'm gonna repost the section of the commercial agreement that they violated for profit: 

[quote][i]Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, Licensor hereby grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset solely:(a) to incorporate the Asset, [b]together with substantial, original content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store[/b], into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Assets (""Licensed Product"") as an embedded component of that Licensed Product, [b]such that the Asset does not comprise a substantial portion of the Licensed Product[/b][/i][/quote]

Emphasis mine, but you can clearly see: 

1) There is no substantial content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store.
2) The asset from Indie Marc absolutely comprises the vast majority of this product. 

Womp womp.  And yes, Indie Marc is distributing this asset under that license on the Unity store, I checked. 

The developer seems to think that not reading the agreement they signed gives them some kind of legal immunity?  Like I said, insane. 

Good luck defending that one in court whenever Unity decides to sue. 

People should be aware that as soon as Unity does take legal action, this asset flip will be GONE.

Edit: The developer fails their IQ test massively and continues to ignore the parts of the license that require they include substantial content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store, and fail to understand that the resultant product (Game) cannot be majority composed of the asset they bought.   The license is right there, I've linked it and quoted it twice.  If the developer wants to keep pretending they didn't breach the commercial license, that's on them.

31048,"FINAL SCORE: 4/10

Darker Skies Remastered, the PC edition of this post-War of the Worlds survival horror game, boasts new graphical features and gameplay enhancements for what should be the definitive experience. However, my experience with the game left me with mixed feelings.

Graphically, the game is a bit of a paradox. On one hand, it looks pretty good, with well-designed lighting and character models. However, it also comes across as very bare bones, lacking the depth and detail that could truly immerse players in its post-apocalyptic world.

The gameplay, unfortunately, is where Darker Skies Remastered stumbles the most. The gunplay feels stiff and lacks the fluidity needed for an enjoyable experience. The absence of sensitivity options adds to the frustration, making precise aiming a cumbersome task. Movement speed is another issue, with walking being too slow and running excessively fast, creating a jarring contrast.

Voice acting, while not exceptional, falls within an acceptable range. However, the overall performance of the game is a significant drawback. Stuttering, low FPS, and poor optimization mar the experience, even on high-end hardware, such as the 7900 XTX.

Mechanically, Darker Skies Remastered is overly simplistic. With limited gameplay elements and a lack of depth, it feels more like a proof of concept or prototype rather than a fully-fledged game. The story is another sore point, as it lacks coherence and fails to provide answers to essential questions about the protagonist and the world they inhabit.

The audio design is subpar, with some sounds being too loud or mismatched. A peculiar addition of a tablet to the backpack, while initially intriguing, lacks any meaningful impact on gameplay, raising questions about its purpose.

There are moments that shine, such as a cool battle against a smaller mech and the introduction of mutants or aliens in one section, though the latter feels like a missed opportunity. However, these glimpses of potential are overshadowed by the game's overall shortcomings.

Darker Skies Remastered markets itself as a ""Survival Horror"" game, but it falls short of delivering on both fronts. The survival mechanics are minimal, and the horror aspect is barely present, resulting in a game that feels more like a walking simulator with basic combat and crafting elements. Had it embraced its narrative strengths, it could have been a compelling exploration of the post-apocalyptic aftermath. Unfortunately, it falls short of its ambitions.

Overall Rating: 4/10",0
31049,"This is the sequel to ""Grey Skies: A War of the Worlds Story"", remastered for PC after it was only available on console.  Unlike its predecessor, it takes place AFTER the war and not during.  You play as Jack, a secondary character from the first game, who in the aftermath scavenges through the rubble and debris for components to built a working heat ray weapon.  Jack operates from a home base (a central hub) from where he can access the various areas of the game.
I liked the game and really did enjoy it.
I want to be clear though that players are in general negative when it comes to this dev's work.  The first game was not received well at all and negative criticism has spilt over to this sequel as a result.  Personally, I feel that this indie dev, still honing his skills, did a good job.  While the first game was focused primarily on stealth, the player here has a choice between stealth and combat - the player wields a pistol almost from the start.  The amount of ammo pick-ups is totally sufficient in this regard.  The amount of red weed pick-ups to upgrade one's character and throwables also is enough to upgrade fully in one playthrough; just explore to find it all.
There is absolutely no need to want to run around like a lunatic and finish the game in under two hours or less.  I fully explored every nook and cranny during my seven hours of play time, taking it slow, soaking in the environment and atmosphere.
I foresee complaints about the movement being clunky and some other frustrations, like there being (mostly) zombies.  However, I feel that much of the negativity towards this game and its predecessor are somewhat exaggerated, unwarranted and even lazy.  Don't enter into an indie game like this and expect a triple A production with epic battles, spectacular stunts and a Hollywood plot.
This is my honest opinion.",1
31050,The graphics are good and so is the story line.,1
31051,"I personally think that this is a pretty decent game with a great concept, but like the majority of new games, it needs work. A few issues that I have noticed is slight stuttering and slight frame drops (That could just be my computer), no sensitivity options (The aim sensitivity was too slow for my liking), no motion blur setting, and the enemies... I personally wish we were dealing with Tripods and Martians instead of brain washed people, the idea of using stealth to avoid Tripods and Martians just seems so much more captivating for me, I kind of hope that will be implemented into the Grey Skies: Remastered. 

As stated earlier, I recognise it is newly released and will most likely have bugs and other issues, but it has potential.",1
31052,"This a low-budget janky third person shooter with terrible optimization. I experienced constant major stutter and frame rate drops down into the 30s using an RTX3080 and i9 processor no matter what I changed in the graphic options. This is most likely due to the Unreal Engine shader compilation stutter that will probably never get fixed by the developer. There is also no manual save and checkpoints are far away. Clicking ""continue"" in the main menu also does nothing. So you must click ""new game"" to be taken back to the last checkpoint. Control settings also do not save and must be remapped every time you start the game. Voice acting also does not fit the lead character, there are too many loading screens, the flashlight runs out of batteries within seconds, and there is also an extreme lack of ammo. The whole experience just feels cheap, janky, and low-budget and I therefore cannot recommend it.",0
31053,"Weird field of view with no option to increase it for ultrawide displays, no native support for UWA monitors either, performance on an RTX 4090 is lacking, to get acceptable performance you have to use render scale 75 and that was at standard 1440P on Ultra preset.

31060,"Very indie space shooter with some nice ideas and too many technical issues.

Update: The latest patch fixed both the ""freeze"" issue and non-working gamepad. The game works as intended now so I'm changing the review to ""recommended"".  However, this is still a very problematic game with many issues. Get it at a heavy discount.

Unfortunately, the game's theme revolves around technical issues. Before I could play the game, I had to complete a benchmark, which crashed my game. Although everything worked properly the second time, the first impression wasn't great. 

Even worse, the game's gamepad compatibility is utterly broken, or it is simply incompatible with my gamepad. When you first enter the game and pick the gamepad as your primary device, the game freezes and displays the message ""Gamepad not found.""

Furthermore, it says to press a key to play without the gamepad, but that doesn‚Äôt do anything. To make matters even stranger, the fire button on the gamepad functions because you can hear the firing sound in the background. Because you can't even get back to the main menu, the only way to fix it is to force-quit the game and play with the keyboard. And that's not fun.

Anyway, the game begins with a brief tutorial in which you pilot a spacecraft with maximum firearms. Shortly later, you're attacked by a shockwave that destroys everything. Only you and your miserable escape pod are able to escape. Although there is an arcade mode, the campaign has much more to offer. This includes voice acting with a thick accent and a less-than-professional tone. 

The objective of the game is to go on missions to collect resources, fix your base, and fly away in a rocket. Everything you need can be found by destroying enemies and objects. Things you can acquire are divided as temporary power-ups or bonuses for your spacecraft and various types of materials.

The base contains four buildings that need to be repaired. Each unlocks additional benefits that can help you become more efficient. The landing platform, for example, allows you to collect additional resources during missions, while the weapon factory allows you to create new weaponry. 

The controls and gameplay are simple: you move your ship around and fire at enemies. Aside from the shield and health bar, you should keep an eye on the energy bar, which allows you to shoot. The more weapons you have, the faster it depletes. Another challenging mechanic is that some weapons may malfunction. All you can do in this situation is wait and try to survive by dodging until it is fixed. 

The game's interesting feature is that it can be played in either side-scrolling or top-down mode. The experience may differ, but the gameplay remains rather similar. If you prefer an old-school mood, you may choose the retro look that makes everything grainy. Overall, the graphics are fine. There are some visually appealing moments, but the game won't blow you away with intricate textures. Sadly, the game can‚Äôt handle some of the textures. One enemy, for instance, causes the game to lag each time it enter the screen.

The number of missions or planets is huge. The first few missions will be boring because your pod is slow and very useless. All you‚Äôll be able to do is grind the first mission for resources until you can afford better things. Luckily, it doesn‚Äôt take long before you can make yourself a proper ship, and missions can be repeated as much as you want. Each mission has four objectives, but there are only important if you want to do everything the game has to offer. 

Unfortunately, the technical troubles persist during gameplay. Some are minor, such as power-ups flying through textures or your energy level dropping when holding the fire button in the pause menu or with a broken weapon. Other problems, however, render the game unplayable. There are several issues that occur frequently and suck the fun out of it. 

The first occurs when you press ""esc"" during normal play to pause the game. This causes the game to freeze completely. The same thing happens during a mission when you acquire a prototype and the camera moves closer to the ship to indicate that you discovered something important. Both issues require you to return to the main menu, losing whatever progress or resources you've discovered.

In the end, despite the slow gameplay, the game can give you a couple of hours of fun. However, random freezing issues and lags are just too much. If this is somehow fixed, I will change the review.",1
31061,"Zen with a Pen is quite a misleading name for a game that becomes very challenging, very fast. I'm not easily frustrated after years of playing Super Hexagon, Boson X and other fail-or-finish games; however,  this little fun right here made for a very infuriating Sunday morning, which I find very enjoyable.

The premise is easy to understand and execute: Guide a small ball through an increasingly difficult path of obstacles, with your mouse working as a fountain pen. Left click to apply ink, right click to remove it but be aware that the ink itself vanishes on its own. Physics are active and a constant stream of air pushes you forward, most of the time right into a spiky ending. I admit in all honesty that this is a pretty hard game, at least for me. I had to take a break in level 4 because I was stuck at the final checkpoint. In order to overcome a couple of corners, it was mandatory to apply the force of a certain power-up. Couple this with a slight degree of randomness, you'll always get when a ball hits a plane, and suddenly it feels like a game of chance rather than of skill.

Speaking of power-ups: there are four of them, with varying effects. One makes the ball very small, the other gives a shield to survive one spiky hit and the one I was talking about before gave a huge boost but only on the first contact with any object. Difficulties range from Easy to Zen but don't get fooled: Zen is by far the hardest, without even having any checkpoints in between. Easy provides more ink and power-ups and yet I still struggled.
[hr][/hr]
If I had to suggest some minor improvements, especially for long-term replayability, two things come to my mind. Firstly, remove the need to finish a level to unlock the next. As of right now, every time I get back to Zen with a Pen, I either have the choice to replay a course in higher difficulty or that one level I'm currently stuck in. I rather enjoy playing level 5 until I hit a wall ‚îÄ or a spike, figuratively speaking ‚îÄ and move over to level 6 until I'm stuck again. Maybe unlock the next level after finishing 50% of the prior course, to give players something to look forward to, even if they fail. This might be personal preference though.

Secondly, the music. I think many tracks are very well done and kind of remove some of the frustration that's building up. However, to restart from a checkpoint, you have two choices: Wait until the camera has settled in again, which, like everything in game can be sped up via holding the space bar, or press a rewind button in the top right corner. The latter is much quicker but causes the music to restart, which can be annoying after repeated attempts. It would be great to have the option to instantly restart without the music resetting.
[hr][/hr]
In summary, Zen with a Pen is great little time-killer that fits perfectly into a lunch-break, a morning routine or whenever you want something that's easy to pick up but hard to finish. It's not a big game, only offering 8 levels so far but I'm sure that it will take some time to finish these, even on lowest difficulties. If there was something I dislike it's the occasional randomness of the ball. This of course can't be avoided entirely but it's unnecessarily adding up on the already  difficult game design.
If you still can't decide, give the free demo a try!

31078,"   Very simple yet effective concept, and executed incredibly well!

   Essentially, you choose a card every few stages that usually gives you a positive and negative effect. While this may seem rather frustrating, I'd say that Punkcake did an incredible job at balancing out all cards, as almost all of them synergise with each other. In one run you may be rampaging recklessly through any and every enemy with your insane movement and attack speed, while in another you'd be cautelous with hazards with a glass cannon build

   There aren't many levels to go through in a single run, and sometimes you may reach the final one with ease, but the real challenge in Damocles Gaze is its achievements, where you must unlock and complete a run with each individual card since the beggining of a run. I'd actually go as far as to say that the achievements are an integral part in the game's replayability factor, as it has only a handful of incredibly refined weapons, similarly to Nuclear Throne, but with a lower scale and experimentation (asie from the cards)

   You will only ever play a run to upwards of a hard cap of 12 minutes, as the game only allows you to actually die once that timer reaches zero, two minutes after the bss of the current stage you're in spawns. ""Deaths"" throughout each level instead send you back to the beginning of it, and while this may seem counter intuitive, it is sometimes incredibly useful to strategize your approach with the level's layout, as sometimes enemy placement may be akward/harsh to comeby depending on your current card loadout

   Overall, I believe that Damocles Gaze is a pretty good game, despite what negative comments I've had previously! I'd possibly reccomend you the game when it's at least on any sale, as the current pricetag maaayyy be a little more than what I think it's worth. That is not to say that it's been badly made, the gameplay is fair while also challenging and there's an amazing amount of polish put into it.

   So play it, It's great!",1
31079,"Didnt feel fun at all, maybe it's just a me problem. The graphics didnt help at all the fact the upgrades feel worthless and weapons feel just too common / mundane, more considering this game was released in 2023, 8 years after games like nuclear throne and enter the gungeon. Canno recommend this whatsoever",0

31087,"[h2] Few games are as fun as Furious Farm! [/h2]

A really, really fun game. Simple as it should be, with delightful gameplay and cool soundtrack. Addctive in a good way.

The main concept (a chalenge between harvester machines ‚Äì each one with its specific characteristics ‚Äì to see who collect more wheat) is taken at its most enjoyable and challenging way. There are power-ups through the levels to increase competitivity. You can put your wheat in a silo (but it takes time, and a time during which you can't collect wheat) or you can carry all in your truck (but if someone hits your truck, you lose a percentage of the collected wheat). Simple mechanics, but extremely well applied.

This game has huge potential to become very popular! I hope this little gem gets the attention it deserves!",1
31088,"Take a competitive item racing game, and mix it with a farming simulator. Works quite well, and I love it. I'd love to see more content added to this game, but even how it is it is quite fun playing. Has some slight rng for stat upgrades, but that adds to the challenge!

Overall 8/10",1

It really slaps when you pile a few friends into your living room, put it on the tv and get rowdy.  Also excellent when going hard against the AI or online.  Bring all the chaos you can muster and win the day!

The devs get extra credit for the perfect arcade music, obnoxious yet still full of irresistible earworms.  Go into the game settings and crank up the screen curve to make your monitor (or tv!) look like a crappy old arcade cabinet screen.

My ONLY issue so far is that as a legally blind person who still has sight, the text is just a little to small for me, but the average person will NOT have this issue.",1
31095,"The art style and feel of the game is wonderful. However, the game is incredibly grindy and progression bottlenecks because there is no skill progression. While there is a lot to do each day cycle, most of it cannot be achieved because time moves at warp speed. More frustrating is how dated the mechanics feel.

Okay, that is the review, below is really a rant:

Most of the mechanics are copy and pasted. Tools take days to upgrade leaving you unable to do certain tasks. You can only purchase items when shopkeepers are at their kiosk during working hours. The progression on planets is the familiar ""harvest resources until you randomly unlock a portal to further area"". 

However, the most frustrating aspect is how many ways the game prevents you from having fun. In order to plant one crop you need the resources to build a plot, the resources to build a battery to allow the plot to work, then the money to buy a seed. After that, the seed needs to be watered daily and the most beneficial crops take 10+ days to grow and provide $80. If you want to turn that into juice, you need to expend more resources to build a juicer (will also mention, that it needs to be unlocked based on unseen stats), build more power, then place a crop in there and wait 45 hours in game! 2 days to produce 1 juice box is silly.

I nitpick because these are the 30 second gameplay loops that players do and they are fundamentally broken. Stamina has always been an issue in these games, but there isn't a reliable way to increase it. Again with the lack of leveling up stats, items become the primary driver of replenishing health and stamina. Yet, as I mentioned earlier, producing things takes too much time.

I'll end with a mention of economy. Most games require a few patches to seriously iron out economies, but the cost of upgrades and the price you get for selling things is comically skewed. Again, items have extreme value in this game yet with production taking forever and the cost of those items returning low values, the grind becomes too real. 

Fortunately, the core gameplay is fun. The economy needs to get heavily tweaked or a system needs to be added to get more stamina consistently or to make the day longer.",0
31096,"TRDR: Loved it, hope multiplayer is introduced

I stumbled upon Little Known Galaxy thanks to TikTok, and let me tell you, it‚Äôs been a game-changer for my partner and me. We were knee-deep in a Stardew Valley multiplayer escapade when this gem came along, and it completely hijacked our gaming schedule ‚Äì in the best possible way.

At first glance, you might roll your eyes and think, ""Oh great, another Stardew knockoff,"" but let me assure you, Little Known Galaxy is in a league of its own. While it shares some similarities with our beloved farming sims, it manages to carve out its own niche brilliantly.

One thing that immediately grabbed my attention was how it made me genuinely care about the characters and restoring the ship, which is something Stardew always missed the mark for me with restoration of the community centre. 

I will acknowledge some of the lower scoring reviews here as well, and say that I do wish that I had the ability to extend how long a day is, or that I had a little more energy to work with as collecting some materials can be a bit of a grind. [EDIT: Regarding the grind, after a bit more game-play and upgrading my laser gun once (was easy enough to achieve this) the grind dissipated and I now feel like the pacing is spot on. I feel like the people whop reviewed negatively based on this, gave up well before that point, the grind is no different to Stardew's early game grind.]
I saw a few complaints about the difficulty of the microbe system, which after trying I was a little shocked by. I found the microbe catching system a touch easier than Stardew Valley's fishing, which is also notorious for being a tricky mini-game for new players. That said I noticed that the creators (a husband & Wife duo) are incredibly responsive to feedback, having already implemented some brilliant improvements, including more alien hair/skin colours, faster walk speed, NPC locator and ability to rename your Tav, the ship etc. With so many great QOL updates already made, I hope that Carbon & Kay hear the constructive feedback and make the necessary adjustments to keep the game challenging and fun.

It doesn't have a multiplayer mode at this stage and I couldn't find any indication that this was something planned for the game. My partner and I would LOVE if a multiplayer mode could be introduced, whereby Captain and vice/co/assistant to the captain work together to rebuild the community and explore space. 

Whether it's nurturing crops, exploring the vastness of space, or fostering relationships with the diverse cast of characters, there's never a dull moment in Little Known Galaxy. It's the perfect blend of familiarity and innovation that keeps you hooked from start to finish.",1
31097,"It is... different!

- slow paced
- progressive grinding
- quite repetitious
- sweet pixel art
- but relaxing too

The Devs believed in ""copy n paste"" when it come to the ""chapter"" design.

""Credits"" is all you get when finishing quests (most of the time)

Wouldn't buy it for 20 bucks - just wait until it's on discount for 5 bucks again!",1
31098,"The bones are good. Cute art. Fun set of characters. I love that instead of ""seasons"" you have different planets to go to. I love that you're a rookie captain trying to prove yourself for captain points rather than just some guy taking over a farm. I wish it was less grindy, but honestly I don't think it's any more grindy than most games in this genre.

The problem is... there's nothing really here. It's basically JUST grind. You advance the ""plot"", grind some more, advance the ""plot"", grind some more... The characters don't say much and don't get much more interesting over time, and the plot is basically nonexistent: you are looking for pieces of the mcguffin. There are some flashes of something more in here (I love that you have to save the sea people from landsickness), but just flashes. Adding more character development and story would help this game SO much. Also, I really think it would help cut down on the ""grind"" feeling if a) you could recycle old creations and b) you could see the whole list of possible buildings in advance (just greyed out, or ""needs recipe"" or something). I see a lot of people complaining in reviews about things that get better, but they didn't make it that far. Making it clear to players that there are goals out there beyond ""get to next planet"" would help a lot with the grindy feeling imo.",0
31099,"Very early impressions:

Pros: 
Huge Map   
Great character customization
Steam Deck verified (basically)

Cons: 
Sleep to save only
Complicated navigation/no quick travel
No tile target highlight 
Days too fast

So far I‚Äôd say it needs more QoL for me to enjoy. I was falling asleep playing. I think the game itself is good so far but it starts off a total slog. Tentative recommend but I will be waiting to continue to see if they add more QoL.",1
31100,"Stardew Valley in space, but with less time in post-release development so less content.

There's some differences.  There's no seasons in space, and you replace the mine levels with planet exploring maps.  And it's easier to get around town because it's a 7-floor spaceship with an elevator.  If there's a fishing minigame, I haven't found it.  Things like that.

Aside from that, surprisingly similar, albeit slightly cutesier.  Hard to complain, it plays smooth as silk.",1
31101,"I'm not usually one to leave a review but the devs have put so much love and care into this game that I wanted to share my own adoration. I did play the demo beforehand, so my playtime is around +7 hours from that - about 11hrs total at time of review. 

Put shortly, LKG just makes me feel cosy inside. The  dialogue is quite uplifting, and humorous at times; the music is upbeat and incredibly well done; the audio feedback in game feels good; the game is bright and colourful, and just very cute visually.

I appreciate so much that the game was made with controller in mind, as someone that has to play games with a controller due to chronic pain. The gameplay feels incredibly smooth. I love the space theme and the fact that it is a story driven game.  The beginning is a bit slow, but it really picks up after a few in game weeks. 

The combat is simple but well done, with a variety of enemy attacks from the first planet visited. If the combat is a struggle for you, you can farm the materials needed for an upgraded Laser Blaster within the first explorable area of the planet (no enemies) by resetting that level to gather the materials needed and the combat becomes a lot more manageable.  

After an in game month, my only gripe with the game is that the movement does feel a slow. There is something available that I haven't gotten around to getting yet that should improve this for navigating the ship  (and it is available within the first month of gameplay). I don't think the base movement speed could be adjusted too much more without massively affecting the combat though, so I'm happy enough with how it is, though if this is a sticking point for you then this might not be the game for you. 

Overall, I've been really enjoying the game and I hope other's decide to give it a try too ^-^",1
31102,"In most ways I don't think this beats Stardew Valley, but it's a good entry into the genre. The demo will give you a good glimpse of the game up to the 10 day mark, and if you enjoy it you can keep playing with the same save.

The art is cute, the characters are nice, and it's mostly fun to play. The days move in 15 minute intervals instead of 10 and your movement speed is a little slow, so it feels like you can't get as much done in 1 day as you can in others. It's an endless game with no time limits, but sometimes you just want to do a bunch in 1 game day. The planet exploration starts out very slow, and with the limited inventory size at the start you can't carry much and the trips don't feel very fruitful. Then the resource and money costs of upgrades is daunting at first (but they have already adjusted some things based on feedback). You can't grow crops that quickly because you also need solar panels to power the planets. The microbe capture minigame, sort of this game's analog to fishing, has a very short tutorial that leaves some people very confused, but the devs added options to make it easier or completely skip it.

But it does hit a groove during the 2nd planet and the issues start getting resolved. The devs are still looking to improve the game but it's definitely ready for a full release.",1
31103,"Lovely game to play if you like Stardew Valley, but you probably already knew that from reading the description. 

I really liked the pixel art, and the fact that I do not need to go hunting for NPCs to gift them items. 

Not the greatest dialogue with NPCs and little variation to fetch quests and combat, but then again I sank 70 hours into this game in two weeks, so overall a win for me.",1
31104,"It's a cute game, I love the theme and the characters are nice. Needs more content. I agree with the other reviews that it's basically a less good Stardew valley, but as someone who loves Stardew valley, that's a high bar so a less good SDV is fine by me.

However. The game is way, way too grindy and it needs rebalancing. Every recipe is ridiculously expensive and you have to keep going back to the planet to grind. The spawn rate for the marker to take you to the next planet zone is also way too low so it can be frustratingly tedious to get to the next checkpoint within the space of a day / without running out of energy and needing to use a lot of items.

Also, stealing the idea of a fake rock becoming an enemy from Stardew is one thing, but making every single rock get up and chase you while you try to finish your grinding is just annoying.

It has potential but needs more tweaking, I'm equal parts enjoying it and frustrated with it as it is, and I'm a big fan of farming sims.

On balance, I recommend it but I wouldn't rave about it. I'd recommend playing Coral Island, Sun Haven, Roots of Pacha or Research Story before playing this.",1
31105,"Nice game, but too outdated. Inventory management is so 1990-s, nobody spends their playtime juggling items between chests and cupboards because the inventory is too small! Also grindy. Example: you need to assemble a quest item that requires 10 aluminium. For this you need a machine that produces aluminium. You need 100 stone to assemble this machine. You can get stone by scavenging, but something like 10 units per in-game day, if u are lucky. So about 10-15 in-game days to just get enough stone for that aluminium-making machine. When u assemble it, u realize it can only make 1 piece of aluminium at a time, and even this will take about half an in-game day. And here's the most not-fun part: aluminium is not the only thing required for that quest item, and stone is not the only thing required for that aluminium-making machine. Dizzy already? And it's just tip of the Boredom Iceberg. Surely you get more resources and better machines later in the game, but you'd probably lose all hope much sooner.",1
31106,"Fairly enjoable little game with a cute colourfull artstyle. It plays alot like a Harvestmoon/Stardewvalley game but on a spaceship.

One big issue I have, is that the gameplay feels very slow to me.

It is decent for its type of game but not great. If you are a Fan of the Genre you will definiteley enjoy this, but if you think these 'cosy' games are just OK, maybe look elswhere or only buy it on a discount.",1
31107,"Stardew Valley IN SPACE!!!  Enough said.
In comparison, the only minor con (for me) is the soundtrack is not as well-implemented as in Stardew.
I don't like that if I stay in one place for an extended period of time, the music stops playing.
I want the music to be on a continuous never ending loop, so I can get lost in this game and just completely forget about the world.",1
31108,"I can't recommend this game as the grind for materials and money is incredibly unrewarding. Currency is very hard to come by as the cost for items and upgrades are very high compared to how little can be made by selling produce, foraged material and quests. Microbe research is the best option to make money at the time but requires a fair bit of effort looking for said microbes and catching them requires a minigame that isn't very accessible-friendly (pretty tightly timed minigame) and becomes tedious almost immediately. Building requires prohibitive amounts of materials considering how much energy needs to be consumed in order to obtain just a fraction of what recipes call for.

Edit: supposedly, the drop rate of resources and amount of energy available have been buffed but I couldn't really notice any difference.",0
31109,"Super cute and cozy, albeit a little grindy and doesn't have enough aliens to romance. Why make a space game with aliens but then make almost all the romance candidates human? QwQ

Though still a solid farming game, having a lot of fun. Definitely recommend!",1
31110,"Way too grindy to be enjoyable.  You got collect ore or rocks for 30 minutes, and come back with enough to [i]maybe[/i] make one item.  I played with a mod that let me ignore stamina and doubled my speed (thanks Nexusmods) which I'd have likely quit much sooner without.

This is not a bad game, in fact with some tweaks I could actually see this game being quite enjoyable.  However, on my 300th trip back to the planet surface to collect enough rocks to make 1 thing, I just stopped booting it back up.  D+",0
31111,"I get that people always are always comparing new farming games to stardew valley, but it's not necessary a bad thing as SDV has become a symbol of the genre's standard. If a new game is on par with SDV, it means the game is good! It's that simple!

Little known galaxy meets the standard of a quality farming game, but it's not an exact clone. It has its own charm and it's what you'd be looking for in the farming simulation genre.

Familiar in the sense of common tropes but fresh enough in terms of how the game is executed to keep you engaged for a long time.

Things I would like in the future:
1. Have children with spouse
2. Day length slider
3. More alien romance options

I think everything else about the game scratch the itch for a new farm life simulation",1
31112,"Recommending but with a big asterisk attached. I like the game a lot, the art style is cute but it needs some serious improvements. For one thing, the energy levels feel unbalanced and deplete faster than seems fair. The tools take energy even if you use them on accident outside of their purpose, things are expensive, there's nothing to do while the ship is traveling, and biggest of all YOU CAN'T HOOK UP WITH PILOT.

I like the game don't get me wrong but I don't think I'd spend $20 on it again.",1
31113,what an absolute GEM. the creators have really set themselves up well with the planet mechanic being the alternative to the usual mining dungeons that accompany farming/life sims. it feels like a complete game but also is rife with opportunity for future updates and DLC. so glad I bought this and can't wait to see  how it grows.,1
31114,"This is one of the best farming sim games I've played since Stardew Valley. It's rare I get so into a game that I am ""addicted"" to playing it, but this is one of those times.

The concept is so cute - you're a captain on a spaceship, exploring the galaxy, uncovering the mystery of the relic and visiting other planets along the way. This is a great idea for future content/DLC also because there could be way more story lines from exploring the galaxy.

Like most other farming sims, money is slow at the start and there is a grind element. My advice is: [spoiler]farm lots & get on the juicers as soon as they're available! Also, xenos are ADORABLE and give you lots of good resources to put into machines and sell.[/spoiler]

The community is great and welcoming and the wiki is really informative and helpful.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes cosy games / farming sims :)",1
31115,"This game is so underrated and deserves more love! Lots of people say it's similar to Stardew Valley but in space, but I think it deserves its own standing. The story line and concepts are different along with the art style. In the beginning, I feel that the game is less of a grind and not as time-sensitive compared to other farming/life sims, but as the game progress and you unlock more planets and resources you can definitely grind more. If you love the mining aspect in farming sims, you will love this game! I love how many different area there are to explore and the added science aspect to this galaxy exploration game. I can't wait to discover more!",1
31116,"Very fun game reminiscent of Stardew in space. I played the demo for 5 hours which ported to the full version, so I have 12 hours in game as of this writing and I'm only on the second planet. Plenty of content and the devs are super active on their discord. Highly recommend.",1

31120,"This game was fun at first and has many good aspects to it. But after playing for a while, I felt it was too grindy to the point that it is a continuous struggle to get money to do anything in the game. This is the first game I've ever played where I felt real genuine frustration afterwards, and not even in a rewarding kind of way. It genuinely made me mad and feel worse after playing it.",0
31121,"It's an ok game. Like Stardew Valley, but in space, and not as good. It does have some neat unique mechanics, but it's just not as charming as SDV and feels more monotonous. I've not noticed any bugs, and the graphics are reasonably nice. Characters feel a little flat. I like the map functionality. 

I probably wouldn't advise buying it at its current price of ¬£16.75, but might be worth it if it was on sale and you've absolutely rinsed SDV of play-ability but have an itch to scratch. If you've not played Stardew Valley yet, play that, it's better and also cheaper.",1
31122,"While this game is definitely relaxing, I have issues with the amount of time and resources it takes to get basic facilities established. The power mechanic results in a lot of grinding to get solar power to power a machine you had grind to get the 60 rocks for, getting 1-2 rocks a node on the starting planet. You lose energy quickly, time goes by quickly, and the starting quest don't give you a lot of options to do in between but to sleep until your crops are grown. The planet exploration somewhat mirrors Stardew Valley's mine mechanics with the checkpoint system, however, you could tackle the first mine with the base amount of energy 5 levels at a time to about level 60 out 120 with no preparation. Little-Known Galaxy, with the way to progress planet exploration by breaking rocks or digging up dirt, you most likely will not reach the next major checkpoint, even with generous space food spawns from dirt, with out first buying food. While I still enjoy the game, and have found it charming and bug free, these issues, which have been resolved by Stardew and games like it, seem out of place. Combine these issues with little information on the game existing, I find it difficult to stay engaged with LKG in its current state. Many of the crew members don't really stand out or seem like people, however I like Pilot and Doc12. Another issue being a lot of the dialogue you get from talking to crew mates everyday repeats. These compounding factors results in a less engaging experience than other contemporary farming sims and seems like a step back even compared to older sims like Friends of Mineral Town on the GBA. Most my issues could be fixed in a patch or mod and many of my points are subjective and stem from spending 2 hours to achieve something I could've done in 30 minutes in contemporary games. Also I probably need to get good or something.

TL;DR: The days go by quickly with the 15 minute intervals being non-adjustable, you have very little energy and the animation when you run out is uninterruptible, too long, and annoying, the random quests with NPC's usually fail because the time frame is too short for a crop to grow, they ask for too much of an item or enemy to be exterminated for example killing six rocks creatures in 3 days and I've only seen 2. As well as needing 64 rocks for a furnace, taking about an in game week to gather what you get in a day in other contemporary sims. Also needs more mini games to kill time for days where all you have to do is water crops, talk to crew mates, and wait.

Overall fun and cute game that I will probably change the review of upon more updates to the game, but as it stands, be ready to grind. It's honestly a 7 or 8 so far but these issues are more likely to be seen by others being cautious if this review is among the dearth of negative reviews instead of the abundance of positive.

31123,"To start, I wish I could give this game a neutral recommendation. It's not a good good game, but it's not a bad game. It's a neutral-good game. I played it, I had fun, I liked it, but I have gripes lol

Some good points: 
1. I like the concept of the game: a cozy farming game set in space and you travel to other planets. That's neat, nouveau, fun. And travelling to other planets for the different seed varieties is a cool mechanic, essentially allowing you to ""change the season"" in terms of seed variety at will. 
2. I didn't feel rushed to do anything. So many games these days place a sense of urgency on the main quest, but this one they're like ""We've been orbiting the gray planet for a while now, we're okay, but bored of it"" which is great to me! I'm totally fine with just chilling, I much prefer to take things slowly and absorb the atmosphere of a game. High key a great thing for me, especially concerning how long it takes for some things. 
3. The bonuses you get as you raise up the captain rank is such a windfall! Or after donating so much to the museum too. I really appreciated that
4. I wasn't punished for staying up late or getting tanked by mobs. Except for a slight stamina hit, nothing was lost, which thank The Light was so good. It reminded me of My Time at Portia. I kinda wish the game told me how many times I had to be carried to the medical bay like in MTaP lol

The points I wasn't fond of: 
1. I can't marry Kaida. Honestly a crime in my book. üò≠ I get it the main character is a spry 21 year old, and so are all the romanceables, but another game gatekeeping the ship mommy? Damn..
2. The economic (and other) grind. Holy cow that got pretty tedious fast. I spent 2 quarters in the game growing corn bc it had the best price-per-day for me, and even then it helped only so far. Crops don't give a lot of money, and everything costs a lot. I looked at the money I earned at the end of the game, and I had 20k in my pocket, and earned a total of like 230k. Wild. That and everything costs a good amount of resources if you want to be able to finally be successful was tedious too. I felt like I couldn't spend money on extra stuff for my character such as decorations bc I needed so much for everything else, esp when I got tired of grinding and decided to just buy certain things to help speed the process along. 
3. The artifact/gem grind was the worst tho, imo. High key I really didn't like it. I naturally found all of them for the first 3 planets somehow, but by the end I had to use spooksies shop (which was quite expensive) to get the last 2-3 planets worth of gems bc the drop rate is way too low. Way too low. A 10th of a percentage? Whew, lad. Esp since there are 5 of each per planet. 
4. This is a small gripe bc I understand the reason why not, but I did find I missed the seasons. There was no change except on planet-side between the quarters. Except 1 had valentine's day, and another new years day. But on a climate controlled spaceship there would be no weather effects lol. But the planets were okay in variety. A hot desert. A hot lava planet. A water planet. A frozen water planet. It's like, ""oh. okay."" I get it, I just found I missed a sort of variety. There's no autumn planet (makes sense), and the spring planet is end-game.


Overall, the game was fun, but it felt like a very slow grind at times. There were other things I liked about the game, and other things I didn't. But I feel like this list is long enough lol",1
31124,"It's not bad. It's just not good enough to recommend as it is. It seems like it's trying to be Stardew Valley in space, but it's just not robust enough to compare.

The pacing is pretty slow, at least starting out. Having to wait 2 full days for a tool upgrade before receiving it on the 3rd day feels pretty terrible. This is especially true when the tool in question is the blaster, which is used for both mining and combat. With no way to mine or defend yourself, all you can planet-side is dig and hope monsters don't kill you. And there's definitely not enough other ways to pass the time on the ship while you wait.

I'd go so far as to say there's not really enough to do in general. The options at day 17 in game appear to be the following:
1. Tend crops. Watering and harvesting are both pretty quick and cannot fill a day at this point.
2. Talk to the crew. Pretty quick, as there are only about a dozen crew members. Again not enough to fill a day.
3. Fix up the ship. You probably could spend a whole day doing this, assuming you have something to eat to restore energy and your repair tool isn't in the shop. Because everything uses that single tool, this gets pretty monotonous, and eventually you'll run out of things you can fix.
4. Explore the planet. On the planet, you can mine, dig, and shoot monsters. If your blaster is in the shop, that only leaves digging. With only a shovel, it's very difficult to harvest resources or progress through the area, and you're defenseless.

It appears to be a lot of waiting because you lack either resources or a tool. I think I saw a few skills on the menu, but at day 17 I still haven't gotten a notification that I've gained a level in any of them. If I've gained a level without noticing, it doesn't seem to have improved my efficiency or unlocked any new items or crafting recipes. Without that sense of growth that lets you access things you couldn't before, it's not very fulfilling.

I love space and Stardew Valley, and have been looking to find a game that combines the two. I'm sad to say this isn't that game. It just doesn't match up in terms of pacing, content, or mechanics.",0
31125,"Little known Galaxy is a farming sim similar to Stardew Valley but taking place aboard your very own space ship.
The story is just okay but all the characters are fun and enjoyable. The gameplay is fantastic! The graphics are cute and all match a theme which is very very important. 
As of writing this review, im 40 hours in and I still have stuff to collect. I still have some story to do. 
Although, the market is a bit saturated with these kind of farming sims, Little Known Galaxy has proven itself worthy to be considered one of the top games in the genre.
8.5/10",1
31126,"Temporary review while I take a break after my first session; I do think I would recommend this as it shows a ton of promise and could be one of the best SD-likes I've seen. However, there's an issue in time management and time wasting. Too many separated rooms you need to walk through to get from one fast travel point to another, too slow of walking speed, days moving too fast. You need to have your mental map of how to get to your destination thoroughly understood in your mind and remember which rooms to walk into to get to the travel points. Walking is a slog, the sprint button moves you to walk. Just a short play-session shows that the game promises a lot of content and a lot of fun upgrading, and the devs have QoL in mind as your crafting bench accesses your storage, but the basic traversal is just a huge pain for now. I may pick back up in a day or two, or might wait a few weeks to see if changes on this get made. 

Thumbs sideways, possibly way up in the future.",0
31127,"I love Stardew Valley and this is definitely a straight replication of a lot of that game.  Except for some key points that make it hard to get excited about it.  The music and art style fall far short.  Which is easily forgivable.  The key point is that the game is on rails.  I've only played to the second planet but the game makes it hard to explore things on your own.  It plays like a very long tutorial for itself.  You can't do anything unless the game decides it's time.  In Stardew Valley you could set your own goals and decide what you were going to do with your time.  There are VERY few choices in this game that are your own.  Combine that with the clunky controls, make it genuinely difficult to relax and just play the game.",0

I'm blown away by LKG! It has so many little awesome details in the artwork. The artwork hanging on walls, how the scene behind the windows changes when you move your ship. The items in people's houses tell you a lot about them.  I'm equally impressed with the different kinds and types of people, from shy to social butterflies, from morning to evening people, from human to robot all different kinds of personalities. Also, the events in the game are so lovely and wholesome. There are 2 main annual events (Friendsday & New Year), and there are short cutscenes between the people that live on your ship. 

The gameplay is so addictive, there is always so much to do. There are times it can be overwhelming but if you follow the quests you unlock new stuff to make it all easier. What I didn't do right was not make multiple machines and tons of planters. I felt like that just cost so much resources, but later on in the game, I could see that by not doing that and trying to get by with the bare minimum, I only made it harder for myself. So I highly recommend taking the time in the beginning to build multiple machines and many planting spots, so you can grow crops quicker, which will help with the quests but also would allow you to make so much more money, and money felt real tide during the storyline when you have to buy things for the quests, but also want to upgrade the ship and your equipment. 

There was this moment at the 5th planet, where I just felt overwhelmed by the quest requirements. It was so much that I needed to take a short break from the game. However, now that I'm on the other side (and even finished the game) I can see I was stressed out for nothing. I should have done what I have done the whole game, first do the quests of my crew members, so I get the items/machinery to make quests easier, and after that go for the quests from the current planet. 

The developers of LKG, Carbon & Kay, are super responsive here on Steam as well as on their discord server and are working hard to make LKG the best game it can be. I really want to highlight that it is so unique to play a game for 70h+ and I haven't encountered any bug at all. At the same time, they also work so hard and brainstorm how to make the game even better, like working on the mini-game to catch microbes and also figuring out how to make it more clear that people should build a bunch of machinery and not just 1 of any type. 

The achievements in Little-Known Galaxy are what you expect from a farming simulator kinda game. Befriend a bunch of people, grow every crop, finish the main storyline, and find every microbe type, artifact, and gem for the museum collection. I would recommend keeping one of each in your storage until the museum unlocks. However, it isn't a problem if you don't keep them as later on it might be easier to get them again. and for the artifacts and gems, in the end game, there unlocks a shop to make it so much easier to collect them. 

I give Little-Known Galaxy 4,5 out of 5 stars.",1
31129,"This game is such a wonderful little gem!! I've only been playing for a few hours and already gotten so invested and lost in the coziness and cuteness of the characters,the exploring, the farming is so unique and i cant wait to see what all this game has in store! Such a new and refreshing take on a farming type sim/space exploration. i recommmend picking this one up if you are into these types of games for a totally new feel. it wont disappoint! to be a 2 person dev team they have done a spectacular job! Loving it!!!",1
31130,"Welcome to [Enter Your Ship Name], we've got: Grumpy Loot[strike]bug[/strike]crab, impossibly cute googly-eyed rocks, and Groot but with a full vocabulary! Oh, and also clones, cats, critters, cooking, character customization, collecting, cutscenes, crustaceans.... 

This is a game that will fill wholesome-cozy-lifesim holes in peoples' hearts. The artstyle is yummy, for a lack of better words. Coming from someone who played and loved Harvest Moon, My Time at Portia, and other gems, I instantly fell in love with Little Known Galaxy during my stint as a beta tester. Now of course, while LKG shares similarities with these games and can be called a ""Stardew Valley in Space,"" that alone doesn't do it justice. The backstories between the crewmates are unique to themselves, detailed and deep, intentionally woven together to create a canvas of one giant story: The story of a giant family aboard a spaceship, and a mystery that piques everyone's interest. 

Your story begins as a novice captain aboard a ... uh, less than state-of-the-art Space Alliance ship, learning the ropes in real-time and putting your prior Captain Training to good use. From there, it's up to you whether to dive head-first into the storyline, or to go gung-ho with collecting resources, producing better resources and kicking space-critter butt. Some of you will no doubt start off the bat with a beautiful living space as your top priority. I've gotten to experience it all, and am so astonished at what this crew of 2 lovely devs have built together.

It fills me with such a specific joy to see my crew members live their own lives on my ship. They have fun with each other, get work done, and let me know their thoughts after something eventful just went down. Getting to Best Friend territory with them all is so, so rewarding. These peoples' lives are diverse and interesting. 

There's so much more I can say about my hopes for the future, or gush over my many favorite details; ultimately I will say that in every aspect of this game, I have found very compelling reasons to pull all-nighters (in-game of course...only in-game...) and play for hours on end to reach goals such as: a well-furnished deck, an efficient garden/production pipeline, a complete artifact collection for a certain crabby someone, a fully unlocked kitchen, amenities for the entire ship, more xenos for my many xeno pods, exploration rewards, and so on and so forth. 

So go forth, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. There's no such thing as a perfect captain, but a captain that does their very best. Take your time and enjoy the journey.",1
31131,"If you enjoy farm games this is a really good one: tons of contents, around 100hrs of entertainment, and bold changes to the formula of the genre.

Just to experience these new ways to make a farm game this is valuable.

I loved the characters, the story, the art, and the gameplay. 100% family friendly.",1
31132,I love the relaxed element of the game. Its the Stardew Valley of the stars. Building friendships and exploring new planets all while crafting farming and cooking. Definitely recommend if you love games like Stardew valley.,1
31133,"i want to like this game SO badly :(. the characters are fun, the setting is interesting, and the game play is engaging. but i just cannot get past the level of grind this game has. the amount of time and resources needed to upgrade/progress is way too high, and it's clear that this aspect of the game was not properly play tested.",0
31134,"As Captain of the USS Stardew, my first mission will be to boldly farm where no one has farmed before!

[spoiler]With more than 50+ hours of content, I suspect my first mission will last quite a while.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Initial Observations[/h2]
I'm nearly 10 hours into the game and have very much enjoyed the experience.  It's been quite a while since I've played a non-Early Access game in this genre and it's certainly a welcome change of pace.

If you've played the pixel art cozy farming games before you'll see a lot in Little Known Galaxy that's familiar.  The two main things that set it apart for me are the space setting and injection of an overarching main story that appears to span multiple planets and a variety of alien NPCs.  It's not your typical ""relative X left you this rundown property to turn into a farming paradise"", but rather a sort of space adventure to uncover the mystery of a relic you found on a nearby planet.  As such, it somewhat gives off Starbound vibes when it comes to the questing, lore and setting but with a bit less focus on combat and more on crew interactions and other NPC relationships.

As far as progression goes, getting access to new gadgets and crafting/refining stations is largely governed by story and quests from your crew rather than a more sandbox tech tree approach.  This is probably fine for some, but I can certainly see how this makes the game feel ""slow"" at the start for others.  Next it's on the player to clear checkpoints on the planet surface (a lot like the mine + open areas in most farming games) to collect the necessary resources and refine them as needed to craft stations, items, and pay for tool upgrades.

The pacing of income is actually quite well controlled in the beginning.  Usually in these types of games there's a handful of easily obtainable drops or refined/crafted goods that you can sell for significantly more money than others and use this to bankroll faster progression.  So far I haven't found anything like this.  Crafting and refining resources and components doesn't add nearly as much markup as some other games.  Many upgrades and construction options cost several hundred to a few thousand in currency, so there's definitely some grinding to be done!

When it comes to the combat, you're essentially using a ranged laser weapon.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of enemies and their move sets for having only made it to two planets so far.  There's melee as you'd expect (some even camo as a resource node), but some charge and others explode.  I did find one ranged enemy type as well.  The visual design and animations are crisp for the player and hostile alien creatures.  I hope the variety holds true further into the game as well.

Overall from what I've seen so far, if this game really is at least 50 hours long at a normal pace, for roughly $20 USD that's a great value for sure.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Observations after 20 Hours[/h2]
Having played for over 20 hours at this point, Little-Known Galaxy continues to deliver a satisfying experience.  While I do periodically get the feeling that the pacing can be a little slow, shortly afterwards through some quest or interaction a faster method opens up and the pace improves.

While most of my initial observations still hold true based on all I've seen up through the 20 hour mark, I've described below some additional aspects that I had time to experience a little more thoroughly:

[h3]Thoughts on Time Passing[/h3]
The rate at which time passes seems fine for me so far. Depending on how you approach talking to most of the crew each day, there's enough time to spend roughly 300 energy (either on ship or planet surface), tend to a garden of about 10 crops, and talk/gift at least 10-15 crew.  This is before I got the hoverboard.  After, the above becomes even easier.

[h3]Thoughts on Traversal[/h3]
Ship traversal without the hoverboard also seems fine.  Sure you have to spend some time traveling to the elevator but I haven't found it too tiresome wandering around the ship because a lot of the key areas are pretty close to the elevator.

The hoverboard isn't as fast as I thought it was going to be, however, because you can get on and off the board near instantly, overall it's a great time saver.  You also don't need to be right next to it in order to mount it and you can go through most doors while still on it.

[h3]Thoughts on Non-Energy Activities[/h3]
It's nice that there are things you can do for progress and currency on the ship and on the planet surface when you've run out of energy for the day.

[b][i]On the ship[/i][/b] the microbe detector is the go to way to spend time when you are out of energy and not yet ready to sleep for the day.

[b][i]On the planet[/i][/b] you can cycle through saved checkpoints and dodge aliens to farm the collectable objects (i.e. flowers and seaweed) that don't require a harvesting action and as a result cost no energy to acquire.  These objects sell for a decent amount of currency and some can be eaten for energy/health.  Unlike a lot of farming games, you can navigate to a previous ""level"" and the entire area will have respawned (even on the same day!).  So this can be a good method to spend spare in-game hours for the day when you don't feel like collecting microbes or talking/gifting with the crew.",1
31135,"For the current price, I cannot recommend the game. Buy it at a deep discount ... maybe. But frankly, I'd advise against it since there are plenty other games of the same genre that are much better.

Pros:
- looks cute
- main story line is kinda sorta okay
- I didn't run into many bugs

Cons
- lack of depth (e.g. in regards to in-game upgrades)
- feels rushed and unfinished towards endgame
- extremely repetitive; planets all feel the same (find x amount of pick up resources, find x amount of minerals etc)
- farming is unnecessarily cumbersome and you are forced to do it (for quests); same goes for your xenos and while that is voluntary, it is just so repetitive with no way to avoid all of the tediousness
- making money is horribly unbalanced; you are stuck grinding away farming for relatively measly sums - it feels like the game is trying to plump up its gametime  this way
- most of the NPC's are generic stereotypes; ironically, the one that you are probably not supposed to connect to comes across as being the most authentic and relatable 
- the way the main story is told fails to build suspension; there is not real emotional payout at the end

Before anyone says if I don't like grinding, I shouldn't be playing this type of game ... I absolutely love the right kind of grind. The  kind that rewards me and pats me on the shoulder. This game just fails to do that for me.

I finished the main story line and can't find the motivation to keep playing beyond that. Will uninstall and I doubt I'll ever play this game again (unless devs drop some amazing updates).

31136,"I love space and I've been waiting so long for a farming or life sim with a space theme that scratched my Stardew Valley itch and I think I've finally found it! 

Little-Known Galaxy is a incredible farming game and it's really embraced its space setting and made it part of the gameplay. You can travel from planet to planet, there are different life forms to meet, and cool new tech to play around with. 

If you'd like to see an overview of the gameplay, I've put together a video showcasing my first 50 days in game to give you a taste of what to expect: https://youtu.be/4961TazMpOQ

EDIT: I've also tested it on Steam Deck and it worked great!",1
31137,"I found this game beautiful, easy to navigate, well thought out and so cute! It is very satisfying to play and accomplish tasks. As someone who hasn't found anything I love nearly as much as Stardew Valley until this game - it comes pretty close. I love the small sci-fi nods (I can order earl grey tea!) and live my best starship captain life, while still farming blueberries and digging for artifacts and farming fluffy space puff creatures!",1
31138,"I want to love this game desperately. The music and art style are beautiful, characters are enjoyable, and the overall aesthetic is everything I love about cozy life/farming sims. The walking speed is abrasive and the spaceboard barely helps. What did me in ultimately was the crafting/upgrade system. Unlocked the watering robots, made 4 of them. Feeling pretty good about making some hard won progress. Then, I finish a quest and unlock the upgraded watering bots. Rather than allowing me to upgrade the bots I already have, the game tells me that I have to re-grind all the base mats + extras all over again. And of course everything requires processed materials, so you need to farm 25 ores or scrap metal to get 5 metals or condensed metal cubes. I tried sleeping through the crafting grind through about 2 weeks but then I hit a point where I needed more silver ore and I just lost all joy and finally stopped. If the crafting/upgrades are re-balanced to be less grindy, I might try again.",0
31139,"Too grindy and gets boring fast.  It was fun at first but then quickly became very frustrating.  It's so hard to get money to do anything, and everything costs so much!.  The microbe mini game just annoys me.  And if I'm waiting the three days to travel to a planet, or to craft something for an upgrade I find myself getting up in the mornings, watering my plants and then going right back to sleep to progress because you can only walk around the same ship so many times.  I play cozy games as a way to unwind and relax and this one just doesn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  The idea of this game is great, but I think I personally have to put this one down for now :(",0
31140,"I really like this game so far. Played the demo before and counted the days till release. 

BUT : this little travel points you have to find while exploring the planets.. this is really frustrating.  Super frustrating when you are at stage 9, trying to find this god damn point and  suddenly send to bed cause you needed the whole day for 4 stages. 

Poor Sproud - I will never get his mission cleared 
",1
31141,"I am really enjoying this, it's a bit like other farming sims but in a different setting. It features different dungeons outside for gathering materials and the grind to get everything isn't too bad. Also love that when it's time to go to bed for the day and you're still out the penalty isn't very big. I hope more players of cozy farming games will discover this little gem.",1
31142,"It's almost criminal how badly this has slipped under the radar - It should be sooo much more popular than it is.

This is probably the closest ""feel"" to stardew I have had since graveyard keeper.

The game is without doubt, the most polished stardew-like I have played.

Bit more of a grind than similar games but I personally do not mind this.

Devs are always cooking - We 100% need fishing guys.

10/10 :)",1
31143,"This game is such a delight. I really enjoyed the demo, so I was eager for the full release. It's warm and wholesome, the ship community feels like a real little town, NPCs are great. Progression is engaging and well balanced so far, with lots of interesting and fun things to do. This game gives me the feeling I get when playing Stardew Valley more than any other game I've played so far.",1
31144,This is just another game that is made where the MC doesn't get much of a change to say how he really feels and that the MC is just used as some pawn in a political game. This game is forcing the MC to accept Sonora the fiance ways and making sure the MC doesn't have a true say. TO me i would of put in the game choose that the MC could of done more the say i don't trust you to Sonora and her father. Or tried to escape and leave the planet or told Sonora the Fiance that you can't be with her if she is going to be in this concubine way. MC should of had the right to say how he felt about this and Sonora not be with him all the time.  To me the game gave little to no chose to the MC and it seemed like in the end all Sonora does is hang out in the pool and nothing else and was never around for the MC. The MC should of had several choice or times to tell Sonora that he doesn't like this or was going to marry her,0
31145,"

This game is being released in Early Access. That means that the game may, or may not, change from its current state.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Forgotten Lectures - Fall of a Dynasty - The Beginning is a Unity based railroad visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You are Faron Taggert. Your father, Marius, has agreed to a strategic marriage between you and Sorsha Tolwyn. You last saw Sorsha when you were both children as your father was visiting on business. Now you are betrothed to her.

The main issue you will need to overcome is the differences in culture of your two societies. You come from a less technologically advanced, and more prudish society. Sorsha's world is military conquest and carnal victory celebrations.

You have been informed, by both your family and hers, that your only duty is to create an heir. You can have as many concubines as you desire.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
There is only one resolution, 1920 x 1080, or the drop down to change resolution doesn't work. You have the option to play Windowed, Full Screen Window, or Full Screen. If your monitors are higher resolution than 1920 x 1080 you'll want to play Full Screen Window if you have more than one monitor.

There is a slight lag when you go from one screen of text to the next, especially if the image changes. This initially caused me to advance more than one screen at a time. You can use the Log option at the bottom of the screen to see any text you missed. I found when I was traveling in space I needed to click multiple times to advance, unless there was a story scene playing.

Day 2 is a bit confusing to start. You're show a cityscape and clicking the screen doesn't bring up the next screen of text. That's because you have to select a location to go to, and there is only one. This continues, where you need to find the location you can go to, again there is only one. The building you need to go to is highlighted, but it is easy to miss due to the lighting. It isn't until Day 9 when you start to have multiple options available on the map.

Being a Unity visual novel, you cannot normally save when the choice selection screen is up, only before or after.

While there is some nudity, there are no proper scenes. Think R rated movie, where you see the characters in bed and then the screen fades to black.

There are some grammar issues, but not major ones.

The Cara Becken character is terrible. There is no way someone that incompetent would be selected to be a military liaison.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
This is like an R-rated movie. There is some nudity, but no actual scenes. The story is okay, but feels like a rush to the finish at the end. It isn't until the end of the game that you understand what the title of the game refers to.

Even when there's a game with microphone, its disappointing to see that only a few players are engaged, its mostly made up of peoples background noise or music, no one uses it to actually communicate.

31212,"Came here from the WAN show sponsor spot and this feels like a product that's still firmly in alpha rather than a polished beta.

The biggest problem is that MetaDock is not user friendly. The provided tutorial videos are not helpful in illustrating advanced features. It's helpful the dev is willing to answer questions in Discord, but having better user documentation guides would be preferable. Changing the theme to anything other than the default risks making the text color completely unreadable. The ability to dock native apps is completely borked (this is noted in the app, but I can't even get confirmed apps to work). It also doesn't help that the app looks like it was stuck in 2005 rather than something modern. I can understand a function over form philosophy, but better design would have been preferable.

The biggest question is what real purpose does MetaDock have? Most operating systems have some sort of available tool to tile windows. It works great when there's a lot of floating windows as I am currently using it as a Twitch Dashboard, but it took a ton of work to get there and the actual dashboard from Twitch would work good enough. I guess it's nice to have multiple accounts in one instance, but Chrome profiles can do something similar and any use cases feels more geared towards cryp/o and finance, and I can't help but feel there are less scuffed options and the crypto stuff just makes it feel shadier than it is.

It does what is says on the tin and it works in specific use cases, but this really needs a lot more work and polish.",0
31213,"[b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2520820/MetaDock/]MetaDock[/url][/b] is an excellent tool!

I use MetaDock primarily as a web browser to view up to 8 stocks at once on my small HD screen.  It has a feature that allows you to save the loaded pages as a group, so you can create other groups of pages to load, then easily switch between groups of saved pages.  You can also easily re-arrange the size and position of all the tiles to make certian windows more prominent than others.  Before MetaDock, I used to spend 20m every day to load many browser windows, go to the pages, and re-arrange the multiple browser windows so they looked tiled on my screen.  Metadock cut that process out completely, and I can be up and running in 20s.  I believe if I upgrade to an ultra-wide monitor I could have groupings of 16-24 stocks at a time.

I discovered that MetaDock can also load any application into a tile, like a game, or a text document, so you can use an application inside MetaDock!  It's a very versatile tool, and I can see this being a big hit with stock/crypto users, managers who want to keep an eye on a lot of things, or presenters who might desire a nice limited interface to show their audience.

It's so nice to have tiled browsing instead of tabbed browsing.  Until I came across MetaDock I didn't realize how much I needed this, and with screen sizes getting bigger and bigger, this is a much needed feature for the future.  It's pointless to have 1 big screen with tabbed browsing, when the pages have so much white space these days.  Tabbed browsing is so 1999, and tiled browsing is the way of the future!

I beta tested this application.  Still, I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to take full advantage of their screen space.  MetaDock is still a first release, and there are things that could be improved on, so it's not a perfect score yet, but I'm hoping the dev keeps improving it and I'm looking forward to see how much further MetaDock can take its features and polish!

31214,"Coming from the wan show, I really tried to give this a shot, but the video tutorial is already outdated and shows an interface that is different than mine, it also was not capable of docking the steam app into it, which was the main reason I decided to try out metadock, you can technically dock or pin apps with standard Windows tools, however, i thought metadock would be a good option as not only can i not fullscreen a youtube video with standard Windows tools, and the Steam window can only be resized so small, so it won't ""snap"" to standard Windows sizes, and i hoped metadock would be a solution to these problems. I even tried running Steam inside a web browser since metadock could not recognize the Steam app, but if i full sized the screen, it was too big and cut off almost half the screen, but if it was not fullsized, it was tiny and took up maybe a quarter of the ""docking window"" with no way to drag to resize like a standard window. I understand this project has mostly been undertaken by one dev, and i like the concept of what is trying to be done here, but i also agree with another review posted here that this feels like it is in an alpha stage, not a beta, I don't mean this to discourage the dev, but in its current state, i would not say this software is usable yet, at least for my intended use case scenario.

31216,"Having been a MetaDock user for nearly two years it's great to see it now go live on steam. MetaDock is my absolute go to application and I simply could't do without it. Having the ability to have all of my work-spaces organised exactly how I want, in a way that was practically unachievable before, is of huge benefit to me. I have multiple work-spaces ranging from one instance to six instances. I use a three screen setup but am able to switch between the six instances with ease. The innovative and intuitive design allows me to create any number of windows within windows, so I can group my applications exactly how I want and they remain there every time I boot up. I experimented recently with how much time that saves me using just one screen and four windows within it using windows docking feature as the comparison. What took nearly a minute in windows took three seconds in MetaDock. I then scaled that up to the six screens that I usually use and that equated to a minimum of six minutes in windows {probably longer tbh} but less than ten seconds in MetaDock. This would mean that if you booted up just once a day using MetaDock compared to organising your workspace in windows you would save over 30 hours of time a year! 

There is a ton of other stuff I could go on about but while this is free just download it and give it a go. The Dev is a top guy and always on hand to help if needed and happy to chat about any feedback or ideas you may have to make MetaDock even better.

For me its a solid 9/10 for now as there is always room for improvement so come join the gang and help us push for the 10!",1

If you're a developer, you can use this to manage different sessions for web applications.

Been using this ever since launch so my hours won't reflect on here, but give it a try while it's free!",1
31218,"Great app, does not use a lot of processing power while using. The interface could look nicer but still usable. Recommend if you have one big screen and want to multitask efficiently.",1
31219,"Brilliant software. Main use case for me is the ability to resize windows that can't usually be resized or have limitations with resizing.

I'm able to do almost as much on 2 monitors now as I could on 3 monitors, as most of my open windows can't be resized to fit all onscreen.

My personal use is to have discord and OBS open, while also having my music player and a 13 band equaliser up. I personally didn't see much use in using it as a browser, since modern browsers and some windows 11 features get you most of the way to what this software does.

Stability is fine, though I probably wouldn't trust it with a word document unless autosave was on.

I'm reviewing this product while it is free, but I've seen in other reviews that this will be temporary:
How much would I pay for it?
Depends really, to streamline browsing... absolutely nothing. You can group your tabs in most modern browsers, and you can snap windows in many different ways in W11 (Which you realistically should be using if your device supports it).
To do what I currently do with it... I'd pay maybe ¬£15-20 as a one off. I couldn't justify paying any more just to save me 2 clicks, especially since I can plug in another monitor and save those clicks for free (mileage may vary).
To use in other ways... I'm unsure honestly. This software certainly has its uses, but even I (a chronic multi-tasker) don't really have any other reasons to use it over the snapping features of windows 11. If you were a huge stocks / crypto trader or writer and need lots of news articles or financial sites open to reference then this could be useful, but if you can keep track on more than the 4 things that windows 11 will let you snap to a single screen at once you should really consider buying more displays or making better use of virtual desktops. If you are a broadcaster you might find use in running multiple OBS instances in groups for each scene in your production or something, but I'm kind of grasping at straws here.

One shortcoming of Windows 11 snapping that this software helps with is the fact that after I shut down / sleep / display off my computer my windows won't always remember their positions, or will be slightly resized for no apparent reason. This software allows you to lock windows into position and save workspaces similar to virtual desktops that you can swap between quickly.
My only complaint with workspace swapping is that I'd prefer if windows would minimise once you swapped a workspace instead of appearing on the corner of my primary display 

Overall: Good enough product, but the average person (and even some more serious multi-taskers) probably won't have a need for it (Especially if the price tag ends up being high). Virtual desktops and windows 11 in general do most of the things this software will do, but there are certainly some niches that might find tons of use from this.

From the moment I started using MetaDock, I was blown away by its user-friendly interface and intuitive design. It was incredibly easy to navigate, and I was able to start using it right away without any confusion or frustration. The application's layout is clean and organised and completely customisation, making it simple to access all of the features and tools I needed.

Every aspect of MetaDock can be tailored to the needs of production teams. With MetaDock, I was able to streamline my Trading processes and get a clearer picture of all markets in one application.

Perhaps the most impressive feature of MetaDock, though, was the ability to rearrange windows to suit you. This gave me valuable insights into all charts and helped me identify areas for improvement.

Overall, I cannot recommend this production-focused application MetaDock enough.

yes you can save and relode tabs / programms you had running in another session, but i can have chrome do that for me as well, its one setting, mind you not reloding other programs and layouts but still nothing to new

31231,"As a professional crypto day trader, finding tools that streamline my trading process is essential. That's exactly what Metadock has become for me, an essential piece of multitasking software to make my job easier.

The thing that stand out with Metadock is the docking feature. I used to spend countless hours wrestling with multiple browser windows. With MetaDock, I don't have to worry about arranging new windows anymore, I can easily move windows around, making sure that I always have the crucial information right at my fingertips.

Everything just seamlessly slots into my layout and meta dock prompts me where the best place is for each window, allowing me to focus solely on what matters ‚Äì making profitable trades.

The docking feature also allows for multiple charts to be open at once, which means analysing multiple tickers is a easy. I can spot trends, patterns, and potential trade opportunities across various assets simultaneously. This has truly taken my analysis to the next level. 

So, if you're a crypto day trader like me, then you'll understand the dynamic nature of this fast paced environment and how it demands adaptability. MetaDock understands this need perfectly. Windows can float, minimise, or go full screen, providing me with the flexibility to adjust as market conditions change. Thank you Metadock!",1

The ability to have an highly custom interface, that is completely detached from the windows explorer.exe, gives this software a wide range of application from home to business.

31240,"This game is a tale of 2 experiences. As a single player game it's dull and tedious. Functionally it's all fine but there are plenty of annoyances like dropped items teleporting and limited inventory for a solo player.

Now as a late night play with friends on Discord game, this will offer up a bunch of laughs and is worth a try at this price.

31241,"I do not recommend this game based on paying 5 dollars to open it and it states it is a demo.
Demo versions should be free, hence demo.
It took me over an hour to find a match to light the fire, and when I got killed, it had an unnecessary cut scene showing a school girl on a stick. (you are probably thinking exactly what I'm saying.) At the moment I cannot recommend it because of these things. Spend your money on a finished game, or at least one that states it is unfinished or early access.",0
31242,"This game changed my life for the better. Ive never felt more respected as a player, the dev really understands your needs. The game's storytelling is its shining jewel. It weaves a captivating narrative that unfolds like a beautifully written novel. The characters are relatable, flawed, and oh-so-human. As I guided the protagonist through their journey, I couldn't help but become deeply invested in their lives, feeling their joys and sorrows as if they were my own.

The game's art style and aesthetics are simply breathtaking. The contrast between light and shadow creates a visually stunning atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the emotional depths of the story. The attention to detail in each scene is evident, and it's clear that the developers poured their hearts into creating a visually striking experience.

One of the game's standout features is its soundtrack. The hauntingly beautiful music elevates every moment, immersing you further into the story's emotional landscape. It's rare for a game to use music so effectively to convey emotions, and ""Love in the Dark"" nails it.",1

31250,"A short puzzle game with very little to get excited about. 

The plot revolves around a young woman who is kidnapped by an unknown organization. She is now compelled to go through a series of challenges with a kinky twist. All in the name of science.

Trials are completed by moving around the playing field to reach the exit and shooting at enemies. This just temporarily incapacitates them, and there is no way to get rid of them. Fortunately, they follow a predetermined path. The other gameplay aspect is avoiding traps.

This is where the naughty bits come in. When your heroine is captured, you are taken to a separate screen where you must mash the button to escape. It's essentially a sexy scene in which you are tortured by various mechanical enemies and gadgets. It doesn't go too far because of the ""innocent"" art, but it can ruin your day if this is your first exposure to the theme.

Energy serves as both your health and ammunition. It gradually recharges, ensuring that you are never left vulnerable. It even works when you are depleted of energy due to traps and enemies. When you run out of energy, the game is over. This can happen quickly if you shoot all over the place and move around with little energy.

You will be taken through three different settings. The appearance may change, but the fundamental mechanics remain the same: simply move across the stage and activate objects to open the exit door. Each location includes five stages that must be completed in a specific order.

There is a basic upgrade system. Some stages contain canisters that can be used to improve three energy-related stats: recharge speed, energy amount, and burst. Burst is a limited ability that allows you to save yourself from enemies without having to press buttons. 

One big issue is that there is are no options or even a main menu that would allow you to quit. The only way out of the game is to force quit or click the X. The lack of full-screen is also irritating because you are forced to play on a small window that cannot be expanded.

The game is only hard if you care about achievements. There‚Äôs one for each stage, and you get it for completing a stage without taking any damage. The game can be completed in a couple of hours. When you consider how much stuff you get for the money, the game is a bit pricey.",1

Also, the achievement is actually challenging,it makes up for the problem of short game time.
This good design can accommodate both casual players and players who love challenges.
However,I think it would be better to design a game content adjustment panel.",1
31253,"The variety of animation is good, but there are not enough stages and everything is relatively easy. Finished the whole game under 1 hour, which is why I don't think it is well priced. Should be under 5$ not 10$. 4/10.",0

The unfortunate part is that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd have to recommend most about the game. The game is a competent enough, albeit it pretty straightforward and a bit boring, of a puzzle game. The animations during the puzzle segment itself aren‚Äôt bad, but some are very simple, which is fine. The game is also very short, about a hour, which is fine for a puzzler. 

The problem is, I didn‚Äôt find the actual puzzle game part of it interesting enough to go and want to master it. Maybe some people will, but it just didn‚Äôt click enough for me to devote more time than just getting the scenes. 

Really nice animations, but I can‚Äôt recommend much else about it. I‚Äôd wait for it to go on sale.",0

- Game is short, like one hour full run short
- not a lot of scenes (but those few are fully animated)

-Fully VA
- gameplay is fun and challenging enough, respecting you as a player by letting you think for yourself in ways to achieve
- The ""no hit completion""  challenge is a great incentive to replay the game

31262,"[b]""A typical japanese laboratory where anything has tentacles ready to fondle the heroine no matter if she is a robot""[/b]

[h1] Review [/h1]
Sequential puzzle game with aerial view where we control a cute and sexy robot girl, who must overcome 15 different levels full of enemies and traps that will not hesitate to sexually attack the protagonist.
The game as such focuses mostly on gameplay and sexual content, leaving aside the story of the same and only indormandonos that our goal is to overcome the tests and escape from the laboratory.
The gameplay is based on completing labyrinthine levels to escape from the starting point to the exit door while avoiding enemies, traps and activate certain mechanisms, as we advance in the levels this will present more elaborate designs as well of enemies with faster surveillance patterns and more dispersed mechanisms, increasing the difficulty considerably although by having life / energy rechargeable made it easier to have the ability to wait to recharge the life to continue.
The game also has upgrades for the protagonist as increased maximum energy, energy recharge and increased explosives to remove the grips of enemies, once you get these better makes it much easier to complete the levels without difficulty, however the real challenge is to complete the achievements of the game that require you to complete the levels without taking any damage.
The art of the game is quite good, with the portrait of the protagonist in HD and expressing lewd faces when receiving damage, and the design of levels and enemies in high quality pixel style, the sound is pretty good too with appropriate background music and good sound effects for the environment and for the attacks.
üîû[b]sexual content[/b]
This content is completely immersed into the gameplay and is not like the typical puzzle games where you are rewarded with an erotic image after completing a level, in this game as you take damage the expressions of the protagonist change for a more lewd, and also any enemy or trap in which we impact, jump a sexual scene where we must free ourselves, these scenes have a pretty good pixel animation and with a variety of different outfits for the protagonist in addition to different positions and accompanied by moans to liven up the scene.
These scenes are all non-consensual sex acts and most of them have the fetish of tentacles, robotic, slime, fleshy, etc.
There are a good number of scenes of this type to satisfy your need for manual labor and thanks to the gallery you can watch the scenes whenever you want without having to repeat levels.

üí≠[b]Conclusion[/b]
Undoubtedly a short but quite enjoyable game, with good levels that require analysis and planning to overcome them but without exaggerating the difficulty since also offer the opportunity to players who are only interested in adult content can complete it without problems, adult content is quite good, pixel animations my weakness are quite fluid and are complemented perfectly with the voice acting giving a fairly erotic result, certainly a game more than recommended for lovers of pixel art and for a low price.

31264,"Turqu-chan in the Hentai Laboratory? A Unique Gaming Experience! (‡∏Ö'œâ'‡∏Ö)

[h1][b][1] Intro : [/b][/h1]

Turqu-chan in the Hentai Laboratory is a game that offers a distinctive blend of puzzle-solving, action, and adult content, catering to a specific niche within the gaming community. In this review, we will take an in-depth look at this game, highlighting both its positive aspects and areas that could use some improvement.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience : [/b][/h1]

The game sets the stage with a simple premise: Turqu-chan, a cute and sexy robot girl, is trapped in a lust laboratory and must navigate through 15 different levels filled with traps and enemies, some of which can trigger hentai pixel animations. The story takes a backseat to the gameplay, focusing primarily on Turqu-chan's journey to overcome the tests and escape from the laboratory. While the narrative may not be a standout feature, the game's unique approach lies in its engaging gameplay and adult content.

The gameplay itself is a sequential puzzle experience presented from a top-down perspective. Players must guide Turqu-chan through labyrinthine levels, avoiding enemies, activating mechanisms, and dealing with traps. As you progress, the challenges become more elaborate, with faster enemy patterns and complex level designs. One of the game's strengths is that it offers upgrades for the protagonist, making the challenges more manageable. However, the real challenge lies in completing achievements that require completing levels without taking any damage.

Visually, the game boasts impressive HD art and high-quality pixel graphics. The protagonist's expressions change in response to damage, adding a unique layer to the experience. The sound design is on point, featuring suitable background music and environmental sound effects. The core appeal of the game, of course, is its adult content. These scenes are integrated into the gameplay, with pixel animations that are fluid and a variety of outfits, positions, and accompanying moans to enhance the experience. It's worth noting that these scenes feature non-consensual sex acts, often with tentacle, robotic, slime, or fleshy themes.

In terms of pros, the game shines with its visuals, level design, variety of enemies, and setting traps. The pixel sex scenes are a highlight, and the inclusion of a gallery allows players to revisit these moments at their leisure. Additionally, the game supports cloud saves and offers achievements, which can add replay value. The price-to-quality ratio is reasonable for those who appreciate this niche genre.

On the flip side, the game does have its shortcomings. The lack of a substantial story and voice acting may disappoint players seeking a more immersive narrative experience. Turqu-chan's adventure is relatively short, and players can complete the game in under an hour, particularly if speedrunning. The price point may be a concern for some, given the game's brevity.

[h1][b][3] Verdict : [/b][/h1]

In conclusion, Turqu-chan in the Hentai Laboratory is a unique gaming experience that caters to a specific audience. It offers engaging gameplay, high-quality pixel art, and a robust selection of adult content. While the game may not be for everyone, those interested in this genre will find it an enjoyable and well-crafted experience. However, the lack of a compelling story and the relatively short gameplay might deter some potential players. Ultimately, it's a game that knows its niche and caters to it effectively, providing a balance of pros and cons that will undoubtedly appeal to its target audience.

It's free, try it out.
It isn't that great tho, if this cost money I wouldn't reccomend it.
But I have to commend the devs for making a survivors game free, I feel like they should all be free, there is so many of them and they are practically the same.

Really needs a dash mechanic and more meta progress.  Right now the meta progress is just unlocking other modules, and there isn't that many to unlock, I could see it only taking a day the ""beat"" this game.

Then again it's EA still, so maybe they are adding skill trees and meta upgrades idk.

I have a really buggy computer apparently after installing 1000 programs but Vegas hasn't crashed once in like 175 hours of slaying away at it, and when my TVs and monitors turn on and off through the days and I use other programs, I always am expecting Vegas to eventually mess a render up but it literally just works.  Back in Vegas 13 days I used to be so mad because it would inject a beeping noise into my renders because it thought I didn't own it and crash all the time.  So glad it's starting to actually be awesome.",1
31287,"i really wanted to recommend this software but i can't to anybody now

this software is now completely broken for me, i've used vegas all the way back since 14 but this one has problems unsolvable right now, the newest NVIDIA driver 551.23 isn't compatible (GPU compatibility errors just check out reddit) and i run into sooo many problems (from the preview screen to rendering a video)

i have to use the nvidia cleanup tool to uninstall the latest driver, download an older one and then i can continue to work on a project but im not allowed to render it XD

to render a project i then have to be on the latest driver which wont allow me to make edits XD im running in circles and its a joke tbh

i still recommend vp18, i find it to be much more stable compared to vp21 and it crashes less often imo, sapphire plugins are still wonky on any vegas software tbh so look out for that before purchasing

i dont regret my purchase because i do believe you get your moneys worth with the features within, i just cant recommend something that doesn't allow you to be efficient with your workflow",0

Worst Software bought on Steam for me...",0

And thank you Magix for still supplying a single payment model for those that can't afford a subscription!!

Update: Lots of mixed reviews from reviewers that do not meet the minimum requirements.  Keep in mind I've tried adobe premiere and davinci resolve as well and vegas has the fastest performance out of the three (although adobe is admittedly a bit more stable, just make a habit of ctrl-s as all video editors will crash every once in awhile on typical ram)",1

Ngl the jump from VP16 to 18 wasn't a big deal, didn't change much ,most of the issues wit h16 were still here and there was barely any new features, the only thing thta kept it alive for me was installing Sapphire and BCC plugins, they basically gave an entire second life to tthe software. But so far VP21 really is a big upgrade from 18. Many new features and quality of life improvements, finally a reworked audio system that's much better, 

I'll edit my review once i'll have more experience and playtime, but I know many people have a lot of crash and bugs and it totally ruined it for them. I'm lucky that i do not have them",1
31293,"Frequently crashes/freezes to the point where doing the most simplest of edits becomes unbearable with it's unpredictable behavior of the software. Truth be told, it might be my set-up however I did meet the minimal requirements for basic editing so I expected it to work at least for a little bit before these heavy issues occur and not whilst editing a clip of 46 seconds as a test project.. 

The edits I made to the clip were 5 text/subtitle edits and 1 gif made to blend into the background, the gif turned out to be too much to handle and it went downhill from there.

It's a shame because I wanted to upgrade my editing software from open source to a more professional and paid ""license"" only to face the harsh reality of that the free open source software actually ran way better than VEGAS Pro 21. If the refund comes through from steam (hopefully) I'll just stick with open source for a longer while.. Otherwise I just wasted 200 bucks on a crashing simulator",0

There's no need to switch between versions every year, so it took me three to finally get enough value to upgrade. I will focus mostly on NEW features, but will also spend some time on ones that changed since VP17.

    [*]The playback is way faster even for 4K videos with effects
    [*]Drag and drop nearly anything and just edit it (no need to convert)

    [*]Adjustment events are amazing time-saver to mass-apply effects
    [*]AI features are not perfect, but fast and suitable for social media
    [*]Color correction is finally there (usable, predictable)
    [*]Steam version is limited (no cloud, no MOCHA), but still has AI tools

[b]Overall it's still VEGAS Pro:[/b] quickest tool to edit videos for web, that also allow you to drag and drop nearly any video into the timeline without conversion. There are outdated UI elements and tools here and there, but nothing crucial. It also hasn't crashed during the first hour even though I tried to overload it with a variety of video formats, effects, transitions, etc.

[b]Adjustment events[/b] are the most important part of this version that everyone will be able to use. You can finally ""cut first and apply effects later"" (and not lose any speed on it). Events are set on any track and will be applied to anything below them. There are even transitions and the ability to fade in and out for these events (separately from each video or other track).",1

31300,"i wasn't sure at first, but i'm overall happy with this software.
i have used cyber link, Microsoft built in stuffs, and recently Movavi pro, but they all lacked features i needed.
many other software require work around or just compromises that this software just has available.

i will admit, the ui scared me a little initially, and it wasn't exactly intuitive at first, but with a couple of generalised tutorials, and some prodding around myself i learnt enough to get some renders and whatnot.

i have a few friends who use this software for more professional reasons, and i see why this is deemed as such high software!
it is by far the most valuable video editing software i have ever gotten my hands on!
I have barely scratched even a little of the surface of what this tool can offer but i am extremely happy with my purchase so far.

for those wondering about the refund thing, i would recommend looking up one or two tutorials first, then set your usual 2hr timer, you should be able to get a vague idea of whether or not this software is for you by then! 
around an hr in i knew this was going to be my main go to software!

i got it on offer and opted for the cheapest upgrade version (18 to 21) it just gives you both software versions, but obv i have only used pro 21 so far!

i haven't not done much, but i will also note that compared to other cheaper software (oki movavi is literally half the price, but with not even half the functionality) but probably one of the coolest things this software can do is actually utilise your GPU (unlike others that run entirely off of CPU for some reason)
so finally my 3090 is getting used! 

TLDR: finally i guess i would say, if you just want to edit your holiday footage into something for your friends/family to enjoy, you really do not want to get this software at all!  (go for the cheaper/free options out there and run away from here lol)
but if you do any kind of social media, and don't mind a bit of a learning curve (yes there are tutorials on YT etc but i think you really have to prod at it yourself tbh, then i think from my perspective at least this software is highly valuable!
that being said, i have a feeling ill be flicking between both movavi and vegas pro, at least for the time being (i haven't tried using the editor in Virtual reality yet, (i sometimes like to edit things quickly on the fly while still hanging out in the digital realm!)
i haven't yet found out if there is a GIF rendering option either, so i guess it cant do everything everything (but there's like ten million render output formats, its probably in there somewhere)
but if you feel like reinventing the wheel (who doesn't right?) it looks like you can go nuts with this and a photo editor! (i like krita personally)
in conclusion this software is amazing fun!

edit 2: after around 140 hrs of use, this has become my daily driver, its amazingly powerful, and does almost everything i want it to. (ai tools are unavailable in steam version afaik?) 
i hate to say it but friends have told me about Davinci resolve and its AI tools, which happens to be free... 
ig you could get this product from a website instead and get the included ai tools. but i digress.

for what i have been using this for i am very very happy with the software, i did have one software breaking crash once, but it was fixed with a couple hrs of searching thru tutorials.
(turns out i had to change a setting within the editor itself)
my advice if you do run across any bugs, when you search for tutorials via either search engine or YouTube, try looking at the ones aimed at older versions of this software too! its all compatible with each other to a degree tutorial wise, so thats cool!",1

31309,"I wish I could give a good review on this one because I've used good and reliable older versions in the past, but sadly the app crashes way too much. As soon as I hit spacebar to stop the timer I crash every damn time. I have a high-end PC and have checked on multiple sources how to fix this issue, but I don't find any fixes, just other customers with the same pain of feeling scammed.

If this app crashes even once for you if you just started using it. Refund it immidietly or you will regret not doing it. I've started using Premier Pro now instead, not a single crash when editing the same content as I tried with Vegas Pro.

Don't buy this version of Vegas Pro on Steam, Maybe I would consider buying it outside of steam but at that point I might just get Premier Pro or something else that's cheaper (and better in my opinion).",0
31310,Way better than my pirated Sony Vegas Pro. Only downside is I miss my pirated Sapphire FX Plugins ):,1
31311,lost all my progress for vrcrack video after software randomly crashed. it's ok i'd still use it though.,1
31312,"Coming from Vegas Pro Edit 16 (over 3000 rendering hours in that), I have now acquired Vegas Pro Edit 21 Steam edition and it works fine. I've rendered around 30-40 videos with it now in the last 2 weeks and it was working well. It is running more reliable than the older version and quality looks a little better.

Haven't gone for very fancy stuff in general, mostly cutting.

Can recommend this in general and will probably be working with it for the coming ~5 years :D which makes it so much cheaper than Adobe.

Best thing for me, as I often render multiple videos in a row, is the Batch Render functionality. So I can edit in a bunch, then let the computer render 5-6 videos overnight. This is really a big advantage over many other apps / editing programs and saves me so much time :)

So, can recommend!

All the best!

31313,Vegas Pro is a great editing tool.  A lot easier to use than Adobe Premiere,1
31314,"This is not a review, but rather a helping hand for whoever might need it.
If you experience crashes, sudden stops when pressing spacebar and so on, go to bios on your pc and disable any RAM memory overclocking.
In my case, the memory has a base speed of 4800mhz and I was running it at 6000mhz, getting all these random crashes in Vegas.
It worked for me, so it might work for you too...

31323,"What I wish the next update's changelog looks like:

+ The server default is now WITHOUT bots.
+ the Rifleman now uses your Steam username instead of your Epic Games username.
+ Added bullet penetration through players and objects
+ Added killfeed icons for no-scope and penetration kills, with corresponding experience rewards.
+ Better networking so players don't get knifed from shooting distance.
+ The players crosshair now doesn't move and is now a more orthodox crosshair in the middle of the screen.
+ Player's ping is now noted in numbers instead of the signal graph
+ Ping for servers
+ Host migration always chooses the player with the most stable internet connection.
+ Players with a bad connection don't teleport and flicker around. Added animation and location insertion.
+ Added a clear way of distinguishing bots from players by means of a different name colour.
+ The spawn protection indication is now based on team colour instead of blue.
+ Improved hitboxes for many objects, especially trees.
- Removed the ""take revenge x times"" missions. Some players never get dominated so this mission forced you to lose.
+ Nerfed knives.
+ AI Nerf: Bots now sometimes miss on close range.
+ AI Nerf: Bots don't pull their knife as often as before.
+ AI Improvement: Bots don't all move in the same direction and walk in chains.
+ AI Improvement: Bots don't look through, and try to shoot through walls anymore.
+ Blurred the background slightly of the sniper scope when zooming in.
+ Rename the game Riflemen, without the 'the'.
+ Added unicode and font support for non-alphabet languages
+ Various bug fixes and improvements.

Planned for the future:

31341,"I looked at the dates and this is older than Cum & Climb, but I'd dare say the level design is better. It felt more structured with not silly amounts of repeated objects to climb along. It also had beds, which I felt like I didn't see in the early stages of Cum & Climb (Admittedly I have to go back and play that now that I have some extra time).

But the flaws are pretty obvious. You only get one path, while good climbing up games are littered with plenty of alternative paths. These alternative paths also add up to a chance to save yourself when falling. In this game you better play on easy mode to handle falling, or you are on the bottom since few sections are as on top as a fall can be saved.

There is room for improvements, and I'm not sure I saw any of them in Cum & Climb sadly. But if someone put some work into the level design these games wouldn't be bad alterantives for people who want better motivation to grind.

Gallery felt like a joke since it was available from the start, but you can't really enlarge any pictures so they are tiny. The sex you get on the way up does not seem to be viewable in the gallary, which kind of makes sense if they are there to motivate you to climb.",1

31350,"Lets be honest
We know why you're here.
The h-content sucks. Its using the same three or four models (with different clothes at least, but that barely matters), far too much jiggle physics to the point where body parts will clip through the whole-ass body and show you pure polygons, and generally not all that much there. Additionally, the controls in that mode are finnicky and its nearly impossible to get anything even resembling what you want to do.

Oh, you're here for gameplay? It... mostly sucks, honestly? And there's no tutorial either, despite the first level being named tutorial. Doesn't tell you what the buttons are, and the upgrades have tiny """"""lore"""""" tidbits instead of a description saying what they do. Oh and you can't scroll that either.
The gameplay is incredibly basic and not worth your time.

Which sucks, because the concept of the game is hot, but the execution seems intentionally bad",0
31351,"The gameplay is good. You can travel on the ground, below the ground or above to navigate the map and get to places faster. The tentacles on screen represent you health and can be used to not only grab the girls, but can also cause a machine to fail luring the girls to the location.

The H* scenes are ok, it allows you to switch between different positions using F1 - F8 so you don't always see the same one. Also completing a scene give you more XP then just killing them out right so it still has a purpose

I would like to see more content from this creator and also see them improve

31357,"Hoe tof het concept van een virtuele omgeving van een historisch significante plek in Nederland ook is en hoewel ik achter het idee sta van het digitaliseren van dit soort plekken, kan ik niet zeggen dat ik aanraad om deze ""game"" te spelen. Ik was er met 5 minuten doorheen en de verschillende omgevingen bieden weinig bewegingsvrijheid en zeer beperkte informatie. op het moment dat de bewegingsvrijheid uitgebreider was en je op meer plekken verschillende stukken informatie kan krijgen had dit een veel interessantere ervaring geweest. Daarnaast is dit stuk software 1.5 GB. voor 5 minuten aan leestekst en rondlopen op 2 vierkante meter per ""gebied"". Ik zou grappig kunnen zijn en kunnen zeggen ""ik wil mijn gratis terug"" maar ik vind het oprecht erg jammer dat deze software zo beperkt is en slecht geoptimaliseerd is, terwijl in het concept zelf veel potentie zit voor meerdere delen als deze goed uitgevoerd worden.",0

Ik hoop dat er ook een vervolg komt.

mooi. ik ga weer Rome total war spelen nu.

31360,"Sadly, no.

The whole concept of the game (being able to recruit your own guys) is let entirely down by the fact they are not at all survivable. They will either get mobbed by enemies, or will get shot to pieces while standing still and shooting back. Add to the fact that the upgrades system is clearly not thought about at all, because all of your unit and army upgrades are both boring and extremely incremental in both the in game level ups and after game currency spending, the game is more of a chore to play than is fun.

The translations here are pretty bad too, frankly. Alot of them have clearly either been misspelled, translated correctly but extremely directly, or use such odd sentence structure that i had to re-read them once or twice.

It's a shame, because the idea of the game is fun. The execution is where it fails.

EDIT: Having played some more, i have noticed a few other issues. The biggest is that your health has no way to recover unless you choose to do so on the upgrade screen, unless i'm missing something. This then sends you down a cascade failure in a run if you get hit (Which again, is hard not to do, esp when enemies who all have guns come in the circle pattren!). With some upgrades to your troops, grenades and the ability to heal them has made the game more enjoyable in the last update, the translation is still very poor and the healing issue is my current biggest one. Others include some rather janky animations when reloading, running animation in general being poor, and other various fiddly bits.",0
31361,"I have to rate this down.

It runs ok, but the progression and unlocks are terrible. Both outside and during runs, you get abilities that improve stats by 1%-10% and the most exciting upgrades are the +10 flat damage and the +15% damage for army. There is nothing that creates effects, just tiny stats increases.

You can only unlock infantry no vehicles for both you and the enemy.

Your soldiers have basic AI and will stand to shot or follow you if you're too far, they'll group up doing so and get cleaned up by enemies AOE or own grouped enemies mowing them down. You can't keep them alive, and you have to pay money to buy more.

You can raise your small income during a run, it takes 30-40 cycles for the investment to be pay back, at which point you're nearly done with the run (or dead).

The game could work but need a complete overhaul of abilities and upgrade, so there is meaningful way to spend levels ups and units upgrades.

",0
31362,"An interesting change in the Survivors genre where the bullets are the main thing to evade.

You play a hero and can command a squad of your making (units can be upgraded too) to find your own strategy, which gives you a lot of imagination on what kind of team you want to build. There's also an upgrade panel that affects your whole game which is a nice break from having to individually upgrade every hero so you can try new heroes and don't have such a backlash from not having it leveled it up.

Overall a nice and good addition to the genre to play on your free time!",1
31363,"For $4 this is an easy time killer. Never upgraded past the first hero, quickly realized the heavy trooper was the best (high ROF, Armor, Health) and went from there. You have to min-max the game a bit to be fully optimal (Bring two unit types to the field, but only use the heavy troop, if you bring only one unit type you get generic 'army' upgrades only, but if you bring two or more troop types you can get upgrades for a specific unit and they are always higher than the whole army upgrades)

I've done several 30 minute games on endless, but since the amount of points (warbonds) you get per mission is capped I quickly realized it was way more effective to only run 15 minute games. 

I already managed to survive a rank 5 (highest difficulty) of the last level 'campaign' but maybe I'll max out my hero, army and heavy trooper upgrades and see how long I can ultimately last.",1
31364,This game is undervalued compared to quality. There are good art designs and a variety of weapons. The main character is really cute. Thank you to Humbara Studio developers!,1
31365,"With its eye-catching 2D graphics and captivating art style, this game plunged me into a deep rogue-like adventure. Each character and enemy feels meticulously crafted, showcasing the dedication of the game's creative team. The mechanics of the game keep each playthrough fresh and exhilarating, offering a different experience every time.

Particularly, the immersive atmosphere and striking visual style of the game provide a unique experience unlike anything else. Each level is like a brushstroke: distinct, vibrant, and full of character. It truly feels like more than just a game; it's a work of art.

One of the aspects that impressed me the most about the game is how the gameplay always feels fair and balanced. Every death presents an opportunity to learn and improve for the next game. This allows players to continually evolve and experiment with new strategies.

In conclusion, this game has managed to captivate me with its appealing visuals and enjoyable gameplay.I highly recommend this game to anyone",1
31366,Played it over 2 hours now. Pretty addictive and entertainig. Good purchase for 2.5 $. I made some feedbacks and developers updated the game in a very short time. Playing with Katana is cool. Revenge for my penguin !!! :D,1
31367,The game was a lot of fun. It took me a while to get used to it but then I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the levels were challenging. I would recommend it.,1
31368,I really liked the art style of this game and shooting at objects is very satisfying. It's pretty good for $4.,1
31369,"I found Penguru to be an absolute blast. The idea of playing as a penguin with John Wick's skills is just plain fun. The game is fast-paced and keeps you on your toes from start to finish.

The variety of weapons is great, and each one feels satisfying to use. I especially loved using the katana ‚Äì it added a cool, stylish edge to the combat. The controls are smooth, and the game's design is visually impressive.

If you‚Äôre looking for an exciting, high-energy game, give Penguru a try. It's a fantastic mix of action and fun that I highly recommend bro.",1

31375,"Early days, but initial impressions are very favourable. A simple but addictive game play concept executed well with great pixel art, sound effects and music.

I will update after more time.",1
31376,"Solid idea but extremely short
The game has 7 levels plus a leaderboard one

I like the visuals.
I like the sounds.
I like the music.
Go buy it.
Go make a review.
Go help one of a kind true indie dev out there.

31379,"Dragon Legacy is a re-branded Day Of Dragons. They just put it into a ""new stage"" which means they replaced Day Of Dragons for this  which ""resets"" every ones playtime back to 0.0 hours  which I was expecting them to have a huge mark on improving the game. 

 Some people like it and fair play to those enjoying the simplicity of flying around as a dragon or running around as a dragon and hanging out talking to one another and doing some pvp but that is all there is to it  if you want to fly, find a water and food source fast as a baby and keep hidden until you've grown to fly properly.

Other than that there is not much to it, exploring is not interesting and finding food is a chore with populated servers. People are friendly on most servers but many PVP servers still attack fresh spawn that can't put up a fight.

- Be land or sky dragon
-PVPVE
-Talk to people
-Explore 
-wait to become adult to fly and explore long distances.  

Not my cup of tea still.

Since they made a decision to  Re-brand themselves this normally indicates a huge milestone in development but I can not see a big enough difference to recommend this game. It is still bare bones and I was hoping for a fleshed out game compared to day 1 of Day Of Dragons on Steam.    If they done this to wipe the bad marks then shame on them, but if this is an innocent move,  I am expecting for bigger updates coming faster that will transform the game.  

I didn't play this version long but quickly found it is the very same bare bones game from last fews of playing this game on and off.  Wait till sale OR keep eyes on youtube gameplays that show you the game in action as it is.

They basically made a new game store for a new version instead of keeping their current one which indicates to me they've responded to the negetive feedback over the years poorly.",0
31380,"Its still a broken mess, nothing was fixed for this, they just tossed this out to save their asses after their ""release update"" rendered the main game unplayable for ~60% of the player base. Its not worth it, don't give them a cent.",0
31381,"** For Authenticity please check my review on the Day of Dragons page - I have over 800+hrs on the original gaming branch **
This game is yet another attempt at them to make a cash grab to anyone looking for a ""cool dragon, survival game"" and what better way to do that than erasing all the old negative comments on it! 
I would never recommend this game (either version) to anyone even at the low, low price of 4.99USD and this is coming from someone who got the game for FREE.
** Here is my review of the original game as this game provides nothing extra and has currently no updates since my last review. **

Reasons to purchase Day of Dragons:
- You enjoy buying DLC for content that should be included in the game
- You enjoy a Dev team that is more interested in banning anyone with a negative opinion or who has any sort of criticism about their game than making any QoL or actual updates to the game.
- You enjoy getting e-mails and sneak peaks about updates coming ""soon"" to the game only for them to be continuously pushed back.
- You enjoy having their merchandise pushed onto their kickstarters and labeled ""opportunities"" and ""gifts"" to throw more money into the game than the KS have already done.
- You enjoy a Lead Dev who's more interested in pushing his religious views than any substantial updates into the game.
- You enjoy a ridiculously difficult flight system that - once mastered - is guaranteed to still have you face planting into the ground because of the obscene amount of animation bugs and lag.
- You enjoy throwing your money into a void.
- You enjoy seeing crash reports every couple of minutes.

If any of these things appeal to you please purchase this game! It's guaranteed to meet all your criteria. Be sure to subscribe to their newsletter so you can get the same generic email every single week filled with updates you can't feel or see in the game itself.
If you aren't involved in this game just yet count your lucky stars you weren't suckered into the Kickstarter like so many others with the false advertising of this game only to have what you backed become the dragon that looks like Play-Doh and Neopets decided to make a baby and your backed dragon gets the least amount of detail and work involved. With the added detail that it can't cause any sort of damage or obtain any sort of usefulness or attack except.. making things glow! How exciting!
**Keep in mind a lot of communities with rules also include the rule ""Don't make dinosaurs glow that don't want to"" so your one-and-only ability turns into a bannable offense! **

Please look at the Dev's responses to other people's reviews if you have further questions on regarding whether or not this person listens to their community as they take no accountability and only try to sow mistrust among anyone with a negative review than theirs. Some of the POSITIVE reviews have been left by staff as well - unreliable opinions.",0
31382,"Look I know it only says thirteen hours but that's just how long I've played since they made the beta branch into its own game. For me this came free after they had it 'full released' for a bit over a month, if there's even an option to buy this game without the full release version don't do it. This is the beta branch - very incomplete with a lot of poor mechanics, only three options for playable dragons and glitches. It will likely never be fixed or improved on, this is pretty much just so people can enjoy the mechanics that haven't been fully ported into the full release yet.
That said it is fun to be able to play as all of the backer-exclusive and other paid skins for free over here. That's pretty much the only draw to this branch.",0
31383,"The game lacks mechanics... Like a lot of mechanics... Basically there are 3 pillars for this game:
- Evolve (just over time) to adult, then eat mushrooms to become elder. PVP servers are empty, on PVE you just breed to receive better stats. Boooooooooooring. Srsly, that is it since 2019?
- Eat
- Fly (very crooked mechanic)

Graphics - like a game from 2012...

Overall, I cannot recommend it. There is a gameplay for 4 hours, maybe. Sad that I cannot refund it.",0
31384,"Despite all the negativity floating around here, I love this game for destressing.  I just love flying around the world and seeing new dragons, meeting new people.  It's relaxing to hop in, be a dragon, and fly into the sunset.  Could there be some changes, yeah, but for what's its worth, I'm really enjoying the game.  <3",1
31385,"Dragons Legacy is Day of dragons Legacy Branch that they gave everyone who got the game before this for free. This review is for EVERYONE else. dont waste your money on this. its not being updated. its not going to have dev support. its a legacy version.

Dev this edit is for you, its a waste of money because this version is no longer being updated. You wasted time making this into a pointless side game when it should of stayed as the legacy branch its not that big a deal to switch between branches. Wasting time on this small cash grab instead of working on a already late update. For only 4.99 you the buyer can buy a game that wasn't even planned, a branch of a game that is in early access.",0
31386,"-- [h3] BEFORE YOU BUY [/h3] --

[b] NOTE: ""DRAGONS LEGACY"" AND ""DAY OF DRAGONS"" ARE  2 *VERSIONS* OF THE SAME GAME, BUT STILL SOLD AS DIFFERENT/SEPARATE GAMES!! [/b]
Differences:
""Dragons Legacy"" (5$, old version, no longer updated)
""Day of Dragons"" (20$, new version, currently in EA/development, will give you the game ""Dragons Legacy"" for free)

-- [h3] ""DRAGON'S LEGACY"" VS ""DAY OF DRAGONS"" [/h3] --

As of writing this, the legacy version (""Dragons Legacy"") has more content than the newer/EA/1.0 (""Day of Dragons"") XDD. 
+More skins and easier upstatting
+10x better performance
+Fewer bugs
+Decent hitboxes 
+Actually launches/playable (XD)
+Elder system
+More food (important bc this game is literally a caseOh simulator)
+Etc.

BUT It does have an outdated map, smaller roster, and has been abandon by the devs (isn't receiving updates anymore). If you want to buy the full release/updated game, search for ""Day of Dragons"" (It's 20$ TwT). By buying that game, you'll receive the updated version PLUS this one (""Dragons Legacy"") for free. 


-- [h3] ""DRAGONS LEGACY"" GAMEPLAY [/h3] --

Literally a [strike]walking[/strike] sitting simulator. (Still better than Day of Dragons/1.0 tho XD)


Otherwise, the game features:
+A nice movement/flight system 
(nothing insane but still better than most games)

+Basic to decent PvP
 (Air battles can be REALLY cool-even just to watch-and different dragons each have their own abilities they can use to their advantage. However, ground/""bite fights"" are very lacking, it's literally just spinning in circles TwT)

+A small roster of playables
(The SS (Shadow Scale), FS (Flame Stalker), and ASD (Acid Spitter Drake). The roster may be small however each dragon offers a unique play style, and it's pretty well balanced for the most part imo.)

+Nesting 
(Players can nest together for stats and skins. If nesting for skins, parents can pass their rare or even exclusive (KS/Patreon) skins to their children/hatchies. And if for stats, it can give you insane advantages in PvP.)

+Large map 
(It's very barren tho)

+Groups and clans 
(group up with friends/other solos, or make/join your own clan! Clans can have up to hundreds of players each, and you can find the list of recruiting clans in DoD's official discord. Clans can be very fun, with wars, nesting parties, training sessions, etc.)

+Elder system
(After reaching adult, you will continue to grow/elder very slowly overtime. If you manage to reach full elder, you'll be twice as strong as the normal adult of your species.)

+Other features I'm too lazy to mention
(A few different types of small AI, scenting, etc.)",1
31387,the admins kick you from games if they get angry and you can never go back to that server ever  admims are very mean they tell u to shut up and i wouldnt recomend this gam it can cause anxiety stress maybe just maybe a heart attack and anger,0
31388,When I first entered the game it told me to click (E) to hatch. That was the last time there was any prompt on the controls. I ended up wandering around for 20 minutes and only found 1 mushroom that made me sick and a puddle to drink from. I didn't find anything else that I could eat or drink and there was nothing to do besides walking/running around. This game felt like a walking simulator without anything else to do. I know that this is a very early release so hope it gets better.,1
31389,"this is a truly unique and beutiful game.  It offfers an unforgettable experiance, the devs are hard working and kind along with the admins, and the artist is only comparible to the creater of a second even better mona lisa!
And although many people along with me cant run the 1.0 update the devs STILL tried to make a way for us to enjoy the game by making lowspec!  My old pc cant enter charecter menu without the game crashind but idc cus no one really plays the low spec and for a good reason legacy is wonderfull it brings back memorys of who we are!  And what we have been aspierd to be!  So yes 100% i think this game is worth the money!",1

But there is not really challangeing game more then surviveing as a hatchling if u can get another player to feed u or u get good at hunting. Another thing that isent really grate is that age up to elder takes so much time. To get 1-3 % to age up take like 12h i dont have that time.There is also only 3 diffrent dragons u can choose from..... it could me more. Also most of the lobbys is just children.

31397,"this used to be part of the main game as a branch called UE4 legacy branch. it ran very well and smooth. they very recently exported it and made it its own game. its pixelated and the settings dont do much. it doesnt run well like it used to and doesnt look as nice. idk what they did but it got messed up in that proccess. a year ago this was a nice game even if it was lacking. i cant play the update, the lowspec barely runs and now this doesnt run like it used to. kinda bummed. i dont hate the game just bummed and feel my 20$ for the main was wasted.",1

so this game is pretty boring depending on which class you pick
when you load into a server you with hatch as a baby and have to keep you hunger and thirst up, for 3 HOURS if you picked the cool fire dragon. not trying to be offensive but the game is a waste of time, there is barely anything to do",0
31399,Can't recommend this game.  Control feedback is laggy / non-optimized and janky.  Doesn't really feel right.  There's not much to do in game and the servers are fairly empty.,0

I downloaded the game just to leave a review and warn players not to buy it
This is a DEMO version of the game, which will NOT be updated and will probably be closed soon due to the dead online (the total online barely reaches 30 bodies, summing up from different servers). There is no content in the game, for the first 5 hours you may be interested in raising dragons, but then the game turns into a nesting simulator 24/7. The map is empty, there are only two types of bot on the entire map and it‚Äôs just food
Just don't buy this and buy some game better than this crap on a stick",0
31404,"Keep in mind this is coming from the Head Admin of the game so take that as you will
I have loved this game since its beginnings through its ups and downs, the team has heart behind it and it shows. Dragons Legacy is basically the Old Legacy Branch of Day of Dragons so that folks don't have to swap branches to play with friends who may have been left behind due to min requirements. If you already have Day of Dragons this game is free for you or it should be so if there is any issues there please let the team know.  This game is also a lower price if you don't want to play Day of Dragons but only want the Dragons Legacy so that is awesome.
I enjoy working with this team for as long as they can put up with me.
I have over 4,000 hours on this game and a good chunk of that was on Legacy before 1.0 released so my in game time may be low on Dragons Legacy as a stand alone game",1
31405,"fun flying is not as hared as people say and over all fun
allso dusent take that long to grow",1
31406,"Hi there I do know I got low hours but on the main day of dragons I got easily over 1k hours, I am an official DOD Senior Admin. We host the Official PvEs here and there's some community servers on as well. I've been here close to day one as a Kickstarter Supporter. 

I HIGHLY recommend joining Day of Dragon's Official Discord server to follow the game's updates, new concepts, and just generally have a fun time also see all the updates, different communities around DoD, and events. If you ever have questions to ask, mods, admins and even kickstarters will try to inform you on what you asked (if I'm around I always love helping anyone out). Also, twitter, youtube, and patreon are great for updates as well as here on steam news if you wanna see what's coming up for updates again the trello in #links will tell you what they plan if they edit/update anything it is updated manually like other things. If you do decide to join their patreon (official's), they have different rewards listed on patreon but also in the discord (#patreon-proclamations) once the bot updates your role once you add discord to your patreon account it may take up to three days or so to update.

The community itself on discord and in game are extremely helpful, on day one launch I saw all kickstarter players help out the new people to the game with basic mechanics to watch them thrive and become into their own awesome dragon and even now people who have tons of hours in helping out newbies. I've been in it since I've backed it, and I don't regret it a single bit. The people I've talked to are kind, helpful and they're funny too. I feel like they've become my second family. I've had a blast with them and will continue being in their community and playing this game.  

Note: Dragons Legacy is basically the Old Legacy Branch of Day of Dragons. You don't have to swap branches to play with friends who may have been left behind due to requirements. If you already have Day of Dragons this game is free for you or it should be so if there is any issues there please let the team know. Also keep an eye out on the main game Day of Dragons <3",1
31407,No it is not worth it after the years all they give us is this? whats the point of making a game like this then,0
31408,good game once you reach about teen/adult. when ur a baby its really kinda boring cause you cant fly and it takes a while to grow. besides that the game is fun once ur able to fly and breathe fire.,1
31409,"Pretty fun flight mechanics that have a learning curb. Gameplay wise theres not much content, but it is a nice place to chill, fly around, and chat with other players. Servers are all pve, but players have the option to enable pvp on an individual basis.",1
31410,i absolutely LOVE dragon this game is super chilled once you get used to the controls everyone's really friendly and helpful could do with a few add ons regarding food maybe quests but legacy has more comp style of a mode which is pretty cool as well graphics are gorgeous best dragon game ive played and ive played so so many lol,1
31411,I kind of don't like either Day Of Dragons versions but I would say in my words Dragons Legacy is better than Day Of Dragons because 1. We have more skins in legacy 2. PVP is better since you CAN'T hit people that are behind you in legacy 3. pretty chill if the players aren't toxic or KOS-ers (Kill On Sight) Either way I think its better but I would suggest you play another game for now until it updates and has something to actually do instead of nest or PVP.,1
31412,"Initial note: this game comes FREE if you buy the normal version of Day of Dragons!!

Making a review even tho i'm usually not the one to do so, I played DoD for a long time, since 2019 alpha, and this legacy version it's something i loved with all my heart, runs good enough even on steam deck (you can play 1.0 on steam deck too!!), the map even if old holds many memories, events, and games, it is a game where i come back from time to time even just for nostalgia or for helping players who can't play 1.0 yet!

Should you play DoD Legacy in 2024? YES, specially if you are new and not sure of everything, or can't run 1.0 for now, it's great to start learning the basics, like flying, hunting as a hatchling, learn how to nest with other players, test out skins that aren't in 1.0 at the current time, and also relax and chat if you wish
Note that some things are different in the newer version of the game! that is expected, but things like upstatting and eldering are completely different!
So enjoy the old map and dragons, and I hope to see yall on 1.0 a day!",1
31413,"After playing Genesis when it came out and then returning to legacy after a while, I have been playing Legacy a whole lot more and would highly recommend still playing this version of the game.",1
31414,"its a super fun dragon game were you try to survive and grow up you can also mate, there is difrint game modes pve and pvp",1
31415,really fun to try and progress and help other people. The community is super great and so helpful all that you have to do is ask.,1
31416,I love this game so much when i first started playing was a few years ago and i always had so much fun and i was so sad when i was no longer able to play because of the update but when this version came out i was so happy to start playing again and i have been playing almost every day! and it is so much fun!,1
31417,"Cool. Glad I get to play Legacy whenever I get bored of 1.0, but I wish they would of kept more official servers.",1

In this game you will find fun, hardcore, awesome retro soundtrack, and a lot of hours spent completing levels that are definitely worth it. I recommend playing with a gamepad.
Separately, I want to highlight the soundtrack. Although it is made in a retro style, it sounds modern at the same time. Each of the soundtrack complements the locations with a unique atmosphere and makes them unique.
If you are a fan of hardcore and retro games, then you will definitely like this game.

It is so old-school that you wish for at least the simplest quality of life improvements. But there are no such things here.
And that's either exactly what you're looking for or it's not!

But the slowdowns (or was it the adaptive difficulty mode?) made it impossible for me to like this game. Because it got so slow that it suddenly became way too easy.",0
31436,"I'm writing this review on my son's account, i bought him the game. On my account i have 40+ Killon hours and building, and i did not want to taint my original review of this cult classic by an edit.

Now then, we are shmup aficionados and hold dear brands like Cave, Taito, Henteko Doujin, Triangle, Psikyo, EastAsiaSoft, Zun Stuff, Moss, Siter Skain, Chohou Joutai guy, and to name a few favorite specifics Red Death, AWA, Trouble Witches, Wolflame, Battle Garegga Rev. 2016, Crisis Wing, Gun Wings, Neon Aileron, R-Types, Varth, Progear, Andro Dunos, etc. If it's a decent shmup we want it in our collection. That said, what makes all the above games great besides their original concept would be things like art, music, developer choice of gameplay functionality, difficulty, ship operation, controller option, things like this. It has come across our desk that this Killon game stands alone as a future cult classic in its own right and i will try to list why as specifically as possible below seeing that i have thoroughly enjoyed 40 hours of gameplay and intend on much more:

Ok so it's a difficult game, that's what I noticed at first. I realized almost immediately that enemies were really hunting you down as opposed to generic bullet patterns that are built into many games. I believe i read somewhere that there's an a.i. element to the enemies in this game and that really makes for a challenge as it becomes more realistic if you will. The enemies seem to have maybe 5 different methods of attack at any given time based on where you are on the screen and what your move choices are, and the enemies and various bullet configurations are abounding to begin with. Hard mode is preferred here. The difference between hard and regular mode is not that much as only maybe 20% of the enemies are removed from hard mode to make regular. I believe the game originally only existed on hard mode at first so this is the mode we play. Regular mode doesn't really prepare you for a hard launch mode seeing that new enemies awaiting you will need to be learned just the same. My strategy is slow and methodical, learn by failing. Luckily, there is a practice mode where you can access the stages before you actually attempt them in order to learn a strategy first. The gameplay itself though is a 1cc system which we consider great because it provides an extra feeling of accomplishment and forces everybody to Get Gud or cry. Example, you start with 3 lives but you can only carry over to level 2 what you keep from level 1, and once you're dead you're dead so trust me you must Kill On. That is a huge element of the game also is killing those enemies so you aren't as barraged by whatever they have for you - this will be needed. Strategies seem like they could be easily diverse. I saw whoever it was playing on the store page video and that person is actually a master obviously. I am more lover of the shmup but lovers can become masters eventually, it happens.


Now then,

Ship movement: Impeccable, fast, responsive, properly balanced against the enemies. Enables you to get where you need to be in order to be correctly strategic. 

Gun: Perfect in operation and powerful and multi-directional off the bat, fires where your ship goes which is very helpful,  and is upgrade-able as the game progresses. Available to set in single button mode which fires a constant missile forward while your multi-directional laser does its work, or dual-button mode where pulse laser and missile are separated. I prefer single button because i need all the help i can get. Single button can also be assigned to either X or A with weapon switch option. The power cannon is easy to operate seeing that all you have to do is release your gun when charged (roughly 7 seconds) and it fires. It is crucial to use this at the right time in order to advance through the level. Also I like how when you die you lose bomb access as with many shmups you die and are auto-granted 1 - 3 bombs this is so cheat. Killon is like a more realistic shmup this is to its credit. 


Soundtrack and sounds: Excellent and Perfect soundtrack which captures the essence of the game as a tribute to the old days but brought up to speed with artistic integrity throughout. The Sounds themselves to me are really important to this game (or any other game for that matter) being really good or just good, or bad etc. The sounds in the game are definitely a perfect fit. The levels are perfect and some sounds jump out at you while others decorate the background, providing for a true ambience as if you're in world Killon. Very good. 

Art: 90s style but doesn't feel old. Feels new as when you were in the 90s and it was new. Can also be considered new by 2023 standards so covers all bases good job.


Concept: Excellent. Game plays with a smooth flow. No hesitation for action here. 


Addiction level: High in my opinion. The game is challenging but with each death you feel like you almost know what you could have done better and want another go at it. The sounds again, make it addictive almost like a vegas slot machine or a psychological reward system is somehow built in. I skipped even many bathroom breaks to continue playing this game and i didn't even care. I really like how the game starts and starts over quickly as i guess this has something to do with the addiction level. Good call - by the time you might have quit you're already playing again, but ok because game is fun.


Let's compare: A game like Red Death which i consider very valuable and difficult, and could go for more than $5 on Xbox and $1 on Steam, but this is just fun because of its vibe and Because it's hard. Very Difficult because of the genius bullet patterns composed by the developers. But i think that can be learned if one had the will, whereas with Killon the enemies are more interactive and the music is better, the game is more polished and immersive, and very much again brings that 80s/90s style to the current age with innovation not simply imitation. 


Developer is receptive and polite and we hope to see much more from this company soon on the Steam Market!


I have 605 shmup and building and pride myself on their quality and diversity and if i had to suggest just one it would be Killon. I think it brings the old to the new pretty well and has correct balance and difficulty, and provides immersive and addictive experience.",1

The game offers different modes to choose from, including a practice mode to hone your skills, a Boss Rush mode to challenge the main bosses, and a secret Arcade mode. It's worth noting that there are local and online leaderboards, which add a competitive element to the game.
In addition to its addictive gameplay, Killon is a delight to the eye with its retro game styling, reproducing classic graphical effects such as retro sideways art and scan lines, giving the game a special charm and nostalgic appeal.",1

31443,"""Gumbowl's Adventure"" isn't just a game; it's a journey through emotions, memories, and challenges that etch themselves into your soul. Developed by the talented minds at hoodeeGG, this action platformer transcends the boundaries of mere entertainment, delving deep into the human experience.

From the moment you embark on Gumbowl's quest, you're swept away by a tidal wave of emotions. The vibrant visuals paint a world brimming with life and wonder, each pixel pulsating with a story waiting to be uncovered. The soundtrack, oh, the soundtrack! It's a symphony of emotions, perfectly orchestrated to tug at your heartstrings and transport you to realms unknown.

But it's not just the aesthetics that make ""Gumbowl's Adventure"" a masterpiece; it's the journey itself. As you guide Gumbowl through perilous landscapes and daunting challenges, you're not just playing a game; you're confronting your fears, overcoming obstacles, and discovering the strength within yourself.

Every jump, every dodge, every victory is a testament to your resilience and determination. And oh, the defeats! They hit hard, like a punch to the gut, but they also teach invaluable lessons about perseverance and growth.

Beyond the gameplay mechanics lies a narrative that resonates on a profound level. Gumbowl's story is one of hope, loss, friendship, and redemption. It's a story that mirrors our own struggles and triumphs, reminding us that no matter how dark the night may seem, there's always a glimmer of light on the horizon.

Over 500 hours spent in the world of ""Gumbowl's Adventure"" may seem like a lot, but every minute was worth it. Each hour was an investment in my own personal growth, a journey of self-discovery that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.

In conclusion, ""Gumbowl's Adventure"" isn't just a game; it's a masterpiece of emotion, storytelling, and gameplay. It's a testament to the power of video games to touch our hearts and change our lives forever. Thank you, hoodeeGG, for creating something truly special.",1

31458,"Feels like a slapped together cash grab. UI has some really strange bugs that are clearly a result of poorly thought out programming logic. Physics are terribly inconsistent and clunky. The jump gives almost no verticality yet feels like low gravity - a harsh contrast that makes you feel really heavy. Air strafing is non existent on smaller leaps which simply makes it feel like my movements are out of my control and inconsistent in how far I jump - not something you want in a parkour game. The courses themselves give a pretty low quality ""just took some random assets and made an obby out of them"" vibe.

The game can be funny at times, and I imagine with more players the chaos could be amusing, but the game itself is just really strange and does not feel intuitive to play at all.

This game is a misery simulator. It conveys a disturbingly potent feeling of being a marginalized person in a incredibly unfair world. The presentation has a sense of humor, absurdity, and fun about it, but it is still HEAVY DUTY stuff.  If you are easily squicked out by other people's fetishes, you may want to steer clear.

31483,"i'm giving it a thumbs-up but with a big caveat. If you've already played the developer's other game ""Hentai Femdom Simulator: Femdom University"" then there's really not much that's new here.

The game has changed from a 3D game (which i prefered, to be honest) to a top-down adventure-style game. Although this is a prequel to the prior game, it has a very similar beat, largely the same characters and so on. There's less content than the previous game too, although that's not necessarily a bad thing.

On the plus side though:

[list]
[*] Unlike most titles in this genre, this is an actual game, not a visual novel. It's essentially a resource management game with a (very) deviant twist.
[*] Caters to a broad range of fetishes, including some pretty extreme ones if that's your thing (although you can give them a miss if they aren't your thing). There's a bit too much focus on smelly feet for my liking, but enough other things to pique my interest.
[*] There's a lot less content than Hentai Femdom Simulator but that's probably a good thing on balance. Whereas the other game went off into tangents with monster girls, etc. this focuses on the university side of things and is better for it in my opinion. However, it's disappointing that you can't get into the Skullgirls House (as far as i can tell)
[/list]

Quite a few people are complaining about the price. While they do have a point, the developer has got a track record of putting updates out and given how niche this sort of game is, it's only to be expected. There's simply not going to be a huge audience for this, so it's nice that someone caters to us.

31490," Well, I am kind of disappointed. I enjoyed the previous game from this developer very much but with this one I just couldn't.
 
Currently the game seems to be unfinished and the price is not reasonable for available content. Maybe if it is actually finished then the price would be fair but then why not set it as early access with reduced price? I see that the developer is updating the game from time to time or at least is planning to which is OK but still. Last game cost exactly the same but had much more stuff to have fun with.

I really hate the idea with those citizenship levels. The player is of class d which seems to be the lowest possible rank. When you play the game you are informed (through various humiliating scenes) that those of class d are threatened lower than thrash. This setting places the player in the looser position from the start. In the previous game I believe (it has been a while since I played it) the player was just a normal student that was on the same level as other students and being a bitch is either by choice or skill issue. I think that here is my biggest issue with the game. You cannot avoid or stand against many humiliating scenes because you are thrash and can be easily expelled from the school (e.g scene with biology teacher). You cannot say no. It would be nice to be able to say no, get some penalty (e.g bigger rent etc) and move on, keeping the dignity. Of course there are sometimes places where you can say no (that classmate that gives you homework) or standing against someone who is mugging you but those are sparse and the success is based on your fitness level. The previous game had a fighting system which this game is lacking. Maybe some mini-game would suffice for those? I am not asking for some kind of Chad mode but all those femdom scenes would hold bigger weight if you knew that those could be avoidable in some way and it is the player's fault that things went that way.

 I am rooting up for the developer but for now I cannot recommend this game. Maybe if you love foot stuff, scat, water sports, humiliation or femdom then yes, this game is for you. When the game is finished (or updates will stop appearing) then I will play it once again and maybe change this review to a positive one.",0

31512,"[quote][i]This is the [b]45th[/b] review of the Steam Redlight series, a series where I purposely seek out negatively or controversially rated games on Steam to see if they're as bad as the Internet says they are. It's accompanied by a video review that can be found [b][url=https://youtu.be/Hf_C9G0rc8k]here[/url][/b].[/i][/quote]

[b]In summary, I can recommend this game, and as a numerical score I‚Äôd give it a 7/10[/b]. The game is visually consistent and there‚Äôs a lot of small details in its sound design that give the game a complete and holistic feeling. Backed by an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience with minimal problems makes this game a pleasure to experience. The game has some minor setbacks with how vulnerable it is to some in-game exploits, some controls and interactions that could be minorly improved on, and one achievement that just [i]keeps[/i] getting away from me in a very frustrating way.

[h2]Introduction[/h2]

In Game Time Glizzys, you play as a reputable hot-dog stand operator that has come back from vacation to find your rink-side restaurant in disrepair after entrusting to some lad named Ace. Your appliances are busted and are in-need of repair, your stand‚Äôs reputation has been dragged through the mud by reviewers, and the bank [i]really[/i] wants all $1,000 it loaned you some years back in seven days.

The gameplay is really straightforward, and because over half your shop is busted up you can only deliver basic hot dogs on warmed bread, or a hot dog on a bun with ketchup and mustard. Once a day, you can opt to repair / re-enable one of your appliances to expand your shops‚Äô offerings including more toppings, drinks, and a side. All-in-all, this is likely to over-complicate your workflow since now the orders will get way more diverse, but in turn you‚Äôll end up making more money. If you want to bust your back, you can enable the second register to take twice as many orders and that turns this game from a casual cooking simulator into a hyper-focused, precision-point, clicking cookery since you‚Äôre a one-person gig.

Each playthrough (of seven days) takes about ~45 minutes, and after four and a half hours I got six out of the seven available achievements. We‚Äôll talk about that seventh one later. Other than the sixth achievement, the game was a joy to play, and I‚Äôll tell you why.

[h2]The Good[/h2]

The game has a lot of good things going for it, and I don‚Äôt think any element is any better than the other because they‚Äôre all so high-up. To start with the visual design, we‚Äôve got models and assets that are fitting and appropriate, from the ingredients, to the kitchen, to the patrons, to the hockey rink your glizzy stand resides in. There‚Äôs some great small details such as the change in color for warmed glizzys, or the hockey puck that appears for a quick second if it damages any of your appliances.

In the realm of the audio design, the game has a lot of care put into it in this category as well. I think the voice acting is all sound for the limited performances that were demanded, from the phone calls to the overhead announcer to the sound effects that play at each gameplay element‚Äôs appearance. The varying announcements from the overhead announcer about scoring, fights, which team wins or loses all add a considerable amount of liveliness to the game. 

Then lastly, I wanted to commend the gameplay. It‚Äôs highly intuitive, but there‚Äôs a quick little tutorial that comes up to make sure you get rolling. There‚Äôs a lot of things to engage with which will cause your shifts to go quickly ‚Äî you might not even notice that they can get up to six to eight minutes long! If you‚Äôre feeling a little [i]shady[/i], you can use the same tablet you‚Äôd use to order appliance repairs to send Ace to do some bidding on your behalf. You can send him to the competitors in the rink to cause a power outage, break their equipment, or even commit a robbery. Your competitors are capable of the same and if they see you succeed, well, they‚Äôll do what they can to make sure you suffer from success. Who knows if that hockey puck that slammed your fully-loaded glizzy-grill was [i]actually[/i] an accident? There‚Äôs little time to think about, just yoink those wieners off the floor and throw ‚Äòem back on before anybody notices. Not like anybody cares, but you know‚Ä¶ for posterity.

[h2]The Questionable[/h2]

The smallest of the offenders is that this game has two exploits that will aid in the players‚Äô favor ‚Äî one should come with context that this game gives you twenty seconds to prep your stand at the start of every shift before the orders roll in. If you‚Äôre receiving a phone call that day, you can just [i]not[/i] answer the phone, and you‚Äôll have as long to prep as you‚Äôd like. I found myself using this because otherwise the prep times do not feel long enough and it boiled down to a simple setup of me going in the walk-in, take a step out, throw hot dogs or buns onto the floor in front of the grill for reloading mid-shift. The second is that you don‚Äôt actually have to warm or cook the glizzys ‚Äî as long as you have a warm bun, you can put them directly from the package into the bun and your customers do not exercise any restraint and will ask for three more plain dogs.

After the exploits, there‚Äôs only some minor inconveniences caused by controls ‚Äî I‚Äôll pick on the tablet first; it‚Äôs kind of rough that you [b]have[/b] to use keyboard keys to go back to the home screen or put the tablet down. It‚Äôd be great if these were clickable buttons, or if at the very least Escape puts down the tablet since it has no functionality when the tablet is up. Another one is that there isn‚Äôt a [b]Restart[/b] button in the pause menu. This button would be helpful because otherwise you‚Äôre closing and starting the game back up to start another run. On the smaller side, if you want to pay your loan in one go you‚Äôre stuck holding the (+) button for a minute or two since you can‚Äôt type in numbers and there‚Äôs no ‚Äòpay in full‚Äô option. Then lastly there‚Äôs the serving bell ‚Äî you can hit this bell a [b]bunch[/b] of times and it‚Äôll cause a ‚ÄúFailed Order‚Äù on each press, even if your shop is closed This isn‚Äôt really a big deal, but it‚Äôd be nice if the bell was inactive when there‚Äôs no customers active so it doesn‚Äôt accidentally ruin a Perfect Game run.

Then lastly, my biggest point of contention was based around the perfect game run. I tried several times to get this achievement but something [i]always[/i] went wrong. Sometimes it was a [i]really[/i] impatient customer, sometimes I‚Äôd be working [i]too[/i] fast and send the order early, but there was this one time where I did not know what happened. I didn‚Äôt notice the failed order until I got to the shift summary screen but I got my reasoning several hours later. While editing my review video, I found that at the end of Day 6, while I was paying off the loan [b]after the shop closed[/b], someone came to the stand without me noticing, and since I was holding that (+) button for a minute or two, they left before I could notice ‚Äòem.

[h2]The End[/h2]

Anywhoo, that‚Äôs it. This game was a blast, and I hope this review helped tip the scales out there. There‚Äôs a great amount of care put into a game that‚Äôs priced at $5 USD, and despite the frustrations I still think it was worth the time I put into it. Now that I have some understanding of how I failed that last run, I‚Äôll probably come back for that seventh achievement sometime soon. I just [i]won‚Äôt[/i] pay off my loan this time because the bank can stuff it. I‚Äôll take the $1,000 I should‚Äôve given them and open up a baked potato stand next.

31517,"it's pretty fun. the sabotage mechanic makes it interesting, you can't let your competitors do too well or they mess with you too much. the robbing mechanic might have made it a bit easy though, paid off the debt before the final day and just had a day to mess with al dente. like you pay 50 bucks, you buddy steals 300 dollars, you do this twice and you win. it'll fail once, but if it succeeds once you'll probably profit by like a day's worth or sales minimum. 

in between that though, you have to cook a bunch of food and not take too long. kind weird buying the chili alone is worthless, but whatever. frankly you just need to buy veggie dogs, fries, and drinks, veggie are worth a lot of money, drinks are easy, fries you can prep a ton of them and get tips easily. worth a playthrough.

The glizzy's have such a tiny hitbox I have to focus like I'm going for a headshot achievement in Halo.
You cannot chill because you're getting sabotaged every other second. 
You cannot get into a competitive spirit with it because by the time you get into the rhythm of things the day is over and then the whole game is over since it's only 7 day story.
The settings menu is sad but at least it exists which I cannot say for many other much higher priced games.
I'd recommend it if it was smoothed out around the edges and quite a bit longer but right now it's just meh and on the negative side at that, I won't refund it though since I don't think it's just a simple asset flip. I see that the developer actually TRIED. Not much, but they did try a little bit. 

TL;DR - Super short, a bit annoying, tense and just meh.",0

31522,"ever wanted to run a hogdog shop, now's your chance. Game Time Glizzys has massive potential.",1
31523,could be a good game the directions on what goes on the dogs are not specific sometimes the people ordering just don't show up/ don't tell you what they want. good concept 100% not anywhere near finished.,0
31524,This is a good game and i recommend it its fun as hell SODTAOE,1
31525,"Absolutely glizzed up the competition, Al Dente Pasta ain't got NOTHING on me. 

A surprisingly fun, if not slightly flawed little game that was obviously made with one thing in mind: memes. 

However, beyond the questionable layer of skin that a glizzy may contain is a different number of meats, which also flows into the gameplay. Sure, you may have the option to just sling glizzy's to your customers, or you could go the strategic route and set up your workbench and make sure that every glizzy a customer puts into their mouth is made with the utmost care. 

The sabotage aspect is one of the more unique parts, giving you and your competition a chance to mess with one another. No matter if you get hit with a blackout during a rush, or you find a hockey puck slamming into your dog roller, you'll always need to be on your toes. 

There are some technical issues, mainly condiments going MIA if you grab something else while it's in your hand, or horrifying chugging in full-screen (that could be a me issue, though), but overall, Game Time Glizzys is a surprisingly fun little game that is obviously made with passion and love for the medium. 

Is it anything award-winning? Not entirely, but if you're looking for a great way to keep yourself occupied for a few hours, and want to spend less than you would buying a real glizzy from a food truck and support a Dev who obviously loves what they do, then pick this one up for you and a friend. 

It's a solid 7.5 out of 10. It's no Oscar Meyer, but it's better than the store brand.",1

Amazes me how many developers care so little about their work that they would ask for money for something that is in no way ready for any kind of testing even.  If you have no words on the screen yet.....thats a good sign to wait.  I will be more than happy to change my review.  I have 14 days to refund the game so I WOULD change it as soon as all the major core things are in place.

31537,Really cool bite sized horror game. Like a Cattle Decapitation album come to life. Hope we can get more.,1
31538,"this is like if GWAR did a Pink Floyd cover album

Blasting hogs with the shotgun is pretty satisfying, but be warned: this being a horror game, you won't have hundreds of shells to work with. Luckily there's also a pipe you can swing, and it comes in handy if you can figure out how to flail and jump back just right. There's a little bit of platforming (which I will be calling OSHA about), and some trial and error is necessary to figure out how not to become dead at a few points.

Game's not that long though, and that's perfect because I already work long hours at the pork processing plant and can't spend forever ""grinding late-game content"", as I've already ground hundreds of pounds of meat today and am very tired.




Recommended, especially if you know what kind of horror-action stuff you're into - this will fit right into your collection.

Recommended pairing: Chorizo with a Spanish red. The saltiness of the Chorizo will help soften an acidic wine. If you prefer, Prosecco is also fine.

Book pairing: Tender is the Flesh, by Agustina Bazterrica",1

It's a one time playthrough kind of game. if achievements were added then it would add some more replay value. The game is on the short side but it says right up front that it's intended to be played in one sitting, its also 5 bucks so I can't complain at all. The developer is working on an enhanced remake of the game called Pigsaw Human Abattoir, so I'll be checking in later on for that. Definitely recommend!",1

31543,"Short, maybe 30 minutes long.  Melee combat is a bit underwhelming, but the shotgun is rightfully entertaining.  Think of it as a lightly spooky FPS that's a bit light on story.

Only thing I felt was a little off was, very specifically, running onto the very slightly raised metal platform in the area where you're ascending by a big green fire would sometimes shunt me off to the right and make me fall. Other than that very minor complaint, very solid experience, good stuff.",1

You play as a human trying to escape the slaughterhouse with your wits and stamina against the murderous pigs armed with circular saws to try and kill you.  

The graphics, music, design and everything else is top notch, the developer must have put in a lot of effort of what he/she is doing.  Looking forward to more games like this in the future.

The platforming isn't very good and the stealth/combat might not be for everyone but there's a lot to love even if the gameplay isn't appealing to you (it wasn't to me to be honest).

Well worth a play if you like retro horror, but be aware that this game is made to be played in a single sitting and is about an hour long, less if you're not bad at it like me.",1
31557,"Itch.io exclusive before, now on Steam! Theres nothing better in life than seeing a great but obscure Itch game crawling on the Steam store. Financially worth it for the dev? Probably not so much, but its not about the income, its about the friends they made along the way.

Pigsaw is a wild roller coaster, and even in the few moments where things slow down, you never really feel safe! This game was actually so much fun, short, but fun, I would love to see the world expanded, a bit more sotry and lore, which I know is a lot to ask, but thats just the way I am, the world building was good enough to get me hooked, and I would love to see you take this game, and expand on it!

31577,"[i] My Experience [/i]

I'm a sucker for non-roguelike deckbuilding games, and so it was a given that I would try [b]Creature Rumble[/b] at the cost of...nothing. I was surprised by the card art, which I found to be excellent. I would imagine that developer Rhinosaur Gamez used AI to create it, but even so there's an art to inputting the precise terms to receive what you're looking for. The ""war-like"" matches were pleasant enough, but the sound effects during combat were rather unexciting and there wasn't much of anything resembling a story arc to the campaign.

Even so, the game only lost me after I'd opened a few of the ""booster packs."" I've always disliked booster packs, since I began playing Magic the Gathering over 20 years ago. I built many, many Magic decks, but only bought cards from secondary markets and resellers. It was cheaper for a budget player like me, and I could ensure that I got a playset of the cards most important to my deck. I'd much prefer to gain currency in [b]Creature Rumble[/b] that I could spend in a store that includes all of the cards in the game, even if the cards were priced according to their power. I understand the monetary benefits for Wizards of the Coast in selling their product this way, but [b]Creature Rumble[/b] is a free game.

Perhaps those who find it exciting to open boosters will enjoy the game, seeing what rare they might discover, but I personally just want to get the specific cards I need to create the synergy that I want in my deck. Regardless, Rhinosaur Gamez seems to be a fairly competent developer, so I'm curious what he will release next.",0
31578,"there is not a lot of depth to the game at all, the ai is given much better cards than you are given, the mechanic of upgrading your own cards does not come into play at all because all of your cards are lost after each round, you keep no cards you get from packs between rounds, so you can not even save cards to develop a deck to actually then upgrade any of your cards except for the cards that literally cant get destroyed when they are removed, this has got to be the worst system of card game playing i have ever seen, on top of the mechanics of deck building being completely lacking so is the depth of the card mechanics, there are absolutely no interesting or new mechanics.

31588,"Developer Okyakusama has released an admirable number of idle rpgs of late, admirable in number, and admirable in that each title is far deeper than would appear at first, and each employs unique game mechanics seperating it from it's siblings.

For me, Idle Build RPG is currently the most alluring of the bunch.  In fact, I've never seen so many nuanced systems, so much number crunching, in an RPG.

Loot drops are specific to the selected character, so switching classes out is key to their development.  Chests can be crafted from monster drops.  There are four tiers of skills, with eight freely selectable per tier.  Inscriptions of verying quality can be equiped to enhance specific skills.  Three attack and three defense gems, and class specific imprints can be set to a wheel to further define your builds.  Relics are acquired at set levels and grant passive skills and abilities.

Mercenaries can be used upon reaching level fifty, and can choose from forty skills taken from the main classes.  At level one hundred, each class can choose from two Job changes, for instance, the Knight can become a Heavy Cavalry, or a Paladin.  At level one thousand, two more job changes are available, The Knight can choose from Dragon Rider, or Black Knight.  And there are even more job changes further down the line. 

It should be noted that increased options appear into the long game.  Accent on 'long.'  Artifacts, peak points and the like.  Upon reaching a base level of one hundred, one begins acquiring 'peak levels' which at certain milestones further broaden an already burgeoning build palette.

Some upgrades evolve naturally, and some can be upgraded with in-game currency.  Boosts to XP, power, and currency can be purchased, last a limited time, but do stack.  Note, all currency is earned in-game.

The game keeps track of statistics for all classes, along with a general stat tab.

Basic game loop consists of entering a map location, and attempting to reach it's highest levels, while opening more locations on the world map.

As you might expect, this is an enormous time sink, which from your perspective could be good or bad, considering the asking price, I think it's a net good.  

One typical caveat about these Okyakusama games, there is no sound other than the click of your pointer, and no music whatsoever.  You get used to it.  If you play windowed, you can listen to your favorite content creator at the same time.

A surprisingly robust entry into the genre!",1
31589,You are simply thrown into the game with essentially no explanation and like 2 dozen mechanics that are also not explained. There are free idle games that are better. The UI is also a bit questionable for a game costing you something.,0
31590,"i'm gonna give this a thumbs up because i've allready spend allota time on it (running it in the background while watching movies or playing other games).

but this really needs a better English translation, cause half of the time idk wtf is going on.",1
31591,"I really enjoy the game and it was a bit hard to figure things out at first because there is no tutorial (I still have no clue what Tenacity does), but it is easy to reason through stuff. I have made glass cannons, and poison is your friend! The debuffs persist even when you are dead and your mercenary can use debuffs while you are dead. When your hero dies, it will revive in 30 to 25 seconds. No need to worry about getting hosed all of the time then.

The game is also going to have some depth to it because of the quick change hero system. I haven't really messed with that system much yet because it's going to take time to get all of my hero's equipment at the same level. I suggest doing what I did and focus on the poison hero and the first world till it it slows down. Then, I moved to the other worlds and helped my DoT and poison damage with gems. I also turned off all of the generating items except for the first three. That way I now have tons of equipment chests and will open them with my other heroes to get higher gear for them easily. 

I can tell there are many different ways you can play the game so I hope this helps you if you are on the fence thinking about buying it. I'd love to learn about new ways to progress that I haven't thought about.",1
31592,"In my case after about the 500 hour mark I saw everything there is to see. All thats left after that is optimizing your build in order to obtain the most exp per second

31597,"The character model is weird but that is as far as this gets in terms of originality. A bunch of store bought assets tossed carelessly onto a map that the dev probably didn't test, with minimum thought put to quality of life things. It doesn't even copy the OnlyUp model of letting you grab on to the sides of assets. I assume this is because that takes coding and everything else doesn't Just avoid this.

31598,"Well, what can I say. The game is very similar to all the other games of the dev. If you like all his previous games then you should be happy with this release as well. For me this release isnt good enough to really recommend. Its very short again, the sex scenes are pretty much all the same between the girls. There isnt really any fun dialogue this time and even though I appreciate the change of the character models to make for more options with animations, the execution is not great. The models dont look as good as before and they are animated in a too choppy way. Feels like they are moving at maybe around 20fps which just doesnt look nice.

What I would like to see in future games:
[list]
    [*] more varied sex scenes so they dont all feel like copy and paste
    [*] smoother animations
    [*] improved character models if possible
    [*] fun dialogue, so that even if the game is short its still fun to read through
[/list]

Otherwise if you are okay with the game only being around 20min long and mainly just being about the sex scenes then it might be an okay pickup.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Cats in Heat - Convenience Coworkers is a RenPy railroad visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You're the manager of three Neko girls: Lucy, Daisy, and Sophie, at a grocery store.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
While there are 40 choice options they only have a minor impact on the story, such as how the conversation goes, you're getting some no matter what you select. There are three Neko girls and there are two scenes with each girl. Once you have experienced both scenes with a girl they are no longer available to select.

I was a bit shocked at how forward the girls were, but hey they are in heat.

The animated scenes have less detail than that stills and all of the action is animated.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery. However, the game is very short and you should have no issue getting to your favorite scene. Plus you can use the save game slots to get there even faster.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A short, quick visual novel with Neko girls. Six scenes, two with each girl.

[h1]System Specs[/h1]
Intel i7-8086K Coffee Lake 6-Core 4.00GHz CPU
Crucial Ballistix Sport AT 2666 MHz DDR4 RAM (16GB x 2)
ASUS GeForce RTX 2080 Overclocked 8G GDDR6

[b]Cats in Heat: Convenience Coworkers[/b] is Artoonu's latest entry in the ""Cats in Heat"" franchise and adds some changes here and there.

It's as silly as the other two games were. Here, you're in the shoes of a convenience store manager who has to handle his three catgirl subordinates: a burnout girl, a shy girl, and an energetic one. Things take a turn for the lewd when they get in heat and have intense sexual urges to take care of. As usual, the visual novel takes less than an hour to finish, but unlike the other games, the many options in the game don't affect the story or dialogue in any way.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3016438650

As for the visuals, I liked the characters' design and that the dev animated their movements during the dialogue and the sex scenes, even though it takes a bit to be used to it. So yeah, it's an ok VN whose duration makes it perfect to read during a break. Give it a shot if you're looking for something short with more PLOT than plot; you'll like it.",1

[b] Kink Warning: Public [/b]

ü•µHOTü•µ
Cats in Heat: Convenience Coworkers is an NSFW VN by artoonu which has the twist of 3D models for the three girls, Sophie, Lucy and Daisy (alongside the NSFW scenes being fully 3d). The girls have the typical 2 NSFW Scenes each as expected by artoonu, having 6 total NSFW scenes. Unlike some of artoonu's work, this game does not have any togglable depth, speed or when to finish, being more linear and only giving the option of where to finish. The story of this game is better than some previous, (being a spin-off of Cats in Heat, this is expected) having the main plot for everyone about store performance and getting a raise, with it being a main plot point between all of the girls, with all the NSFW scenes being based off that it's mating season for the catgirls and they have heighted sexual needs/are under tension. 
 
Now to address the main issue point of the game, the 3d models. I personally don't really mind these models, their movements are choppy and some of the models in the NSFW scenes look a bit odd (not bad, just odd) but I think it adds to the charm of the game. The only thing I will say that I dislike with these 3d models is the semen, as it looks very globby and unnatural (almost like glue). 

The music from the game doesnt detract nor the rest of the artwork. The writing is quite standard to artoonu's other works, having three differing personality girls, one bubbly, one moody and one shy and their writing reflects this. 

Overall, I can understand if you don't want to purchase this visual novel based on the 3d models, although for me - I can't recommend it at full price although I think it's a decent pickup when it's on a sale or part of the ""games by artoonu"" bundle.",1
31606,"I kinda felt like this entry was almost a little depressing with all the somewhat realistic talk about working in a convenience store. I thought that the 3D animations were interesting and somewhat of an improvement to some of the previous works. I felt that this entry had a lot less variation in what could be done during sex.

Overall I still feel that this dev is progressing well and improves their work with every new entry.",1
31607,Probably the worst game by this dev. Rushed and boring. The animations are so poorly done.,0

If you like the style, it's a great game. The puzzles, the most important thing in that kind of game are not too difficult, there are some red herrings and overall: Quite solvable and not completely unlogical or stupid. Weird? Yes, sometimes. Unexpected? Yes, that too.
",1
31623,"A superb homage to the point-and-click classics, but with a distinct personality of its own. This little adventure is an introduction to a bigger game, but the attention to detail in the setting, music and animations is phenomenal!
Impatiently awaiting the release of ""Will's (or his descendants') Great and Gargantuan Adventure"", all I can do is recommend this game to all those who loved the adventure games of the early 90s.",1
31624,"Sadly I cannot recommend this game to anybody. It¬¥s a simple 90¬¥s point and click game and it would probably be enjoyable, if it was playable... The developers implemented a bunch of mechanics but decided to not implement any of them correctly. So there are multiple times where you miss an object because you used the wrong commands. Most of the commands are also useless 90% of the time so it¬¥s never clear what or when you should use something.

Another thing is the mapping of these commands. Left click is almost always walk, even if pointed at an object, which is weird. It usually becomes walk to and do ""x"", but not in this game. Same thing with right click, its almost always ""look at"" which is almost always useless, and it changed randomly. The open and close commands are worthless and dumb, you should have open as walk to and do ""x"" (open when on door etc) and close should not be a thing. 

There is a bug with books which stalls your game for multiple seconds after you have read one. The save system is also extremely stupid as there are achievements/systems which kill your player and closes your game upon death. Which resets your game back to your latest manual save as there are no auto saves (to my knowledge).

Worst of all is the achievement which you can only obtain by buying their soundtrack so you cannot get 100%. Make it content DLC or put a price on the game. NEVER place 100% behind a cosmetic paywall.

That¬¥s all I came up with in my 30 min of playtime, because I realized I was wasting my time...

Edit: After speaking with Illiterate Code games over Email, we have realised that I may have found some bugs, so I¬¥m very happy that those were found. I will certainly look into playing the game again and most likely changing this review after bugfixes/updates have come through. Cheers!",0
31625,"Pretty good as an adventure game. Although in this case in fact very well done I am personally not an enormous fan of retro pixel art; would've loved this game in its store page title artwork style. And for it to have a more modern interface. And it being a large open-world action-adventure. And...

Oh never  mind. Recommended. Sound and music are also quite good. Well worth its 5 or so hours.",1
31626,"- One achievement is literally buying the soundtrack with real money

- Many solutions are not at all intuitive or even noticeable or conflict with prior information

- The 9 action grid could be avoided completely and only serves to overwhelm a player with meaningless options. I believe I used push and pull once each. Used ""give"" only once because the energy bar item is arbitrarily eaten if you click it normally. 

- Many items seem to have no use, further contributing to confusion over what you are actually able or meant to do

Specific annoyances:

Arbitrarily can't pick up shirt until end of the game

I genuinely don't know where the recipe solution was meant to come from, I followed a guide out of annoyance. Maybe it was in one of the 100 pixel-perfect books on the shelves.

The pencil is burned in order to use its lead, but the bad pencil can't for no reason, even though it would make more sense since you wouldn't want to ruin the good one.

A few items I completed the game without using: magnifying glass, tongs, bread, salami, sock, cheese

There are very few items the slingshot will work on, but only the horn can be hit with the beans.

The hockey stick must be used under the bed more than once.

Mothballs are used to feed a person, a person who is sleeping.

Once the beans are combined with the slingshot you shouldn't really need to combine them again after every use.

Actions like using the anvil should be skipped when using the torch, as it's implied it is going to be used as a step as that the entire reason it is placed there.",0

31630,"It¬¥s inconvenient since you have to select the actions before you click onto something, there are no settings the only thing you can adjust is the sound volume, which for me is a useless settig since i always use the volume mixer, so basically no settings at all, but its available in 8 languages.
A hints feature would be nice, for those who get stuck.
Also your grandpa just sleeps and no matter what you try to wake him up, it doesn¬¥t work (unless I haven`t found the right thing, didn¬¥t try too much), but if you touch the trophy on the other side of the room he wakes up and says something to you, just to be back asleep right after.
Although I didn¬¥t like the game too much, I still think that it`s a solid game, especially if you don¬¥t have a problem with the aforementioned and like classic point&click adventures.

Decide for yourself.",1
31631,"Powers in the Basement is a super funny old-school adventure: the game is short, with few locations but a lot of items to mess around with.

few times in the game I was doing the exact right thing, but the character refused (eg. [spoiler]""I don't want to pick up the flies""[/spoiler], [spoiler]""I don't want to use rope on anvil""[/spoiler]) without any indication of why. 

Some mission critical items can be aquired only by doing an action, which got you one useless item already, twice. [spoiler]The mug under the bed[/spoiler].

Other than that, the game is fine. Lovely retro art style, nice music, all those things that tickle the old lucasarts adventure bones.",1

- Great artwork and animation

Si no us agraden aquesta mena de jocs, no recomano que el jugui. Tamb√© molt bo per iniciar-se aquest tipus de joc que √©s gratu√Øt. Agraeixo molt a les persones d'Illiterate code Games haver posat el joc oficial en catal√†. S'agraeix molt. Traducci√≥ en catal√† de Scr34m (AbanSocios).

Penso que el joc no disposi d'un ""Load"" √©s un problema. Est√† b√© que permeti guardar dintre del joc, a m√©s a m√©s hauria de permetre sortir del joc sense guardar i carregar dintre del joc.

I understand that not everyone may share the same concerns, and some might not even see this as an issue. However, for me, it's a significant turnoff, and it's disheartening to see practices like this within the indie gaming community. Developers need to find a balance between monetization and player satisfaction, without resorting to tactics that could potentially alienate their audience.

With that out of the way, as I was scrolling through the achievements list for this game, one of them immediately caught my eye: ""[Supporter] Buy the Extended Soundtrack to support our work :)"". This seemed like an odd addition, veering more towards monetization than rewarding in-game accomplishments. Now, to achieve a ""Perfect Game"" status, players are essentially required to support the developers by buying their soundtrack. It raises questions about whether such costs should be bundled into the game's initial price.

The implementation feels somewhat coercive, potentially pressuring players into purchasing something they may not necessarily want or use. Achievements should be based on actual gameplay, not monetary transactions. While supporting the game is commendable, making the soundtrack a compulsory purchase feels rather heavy-handed.

Moreover, this approach somewhat diminishes any positive sentiments I might have had towards the developers. Had they opted not to include this feature, I might have considered supporting their project postgame by purchasing the soundtrack. However, as it stands, this mandatory inclusion detracts from the overall experience. It's disheartening to witness such tactics overshadowing the core enjoyment of the game.

Initially, I was genuinely excited to dive into the game. However, upon realizing what was happening with the achievement system, I felt compelled to voice my concerns. It's disappointing when promising experiences are tarnished by questionable practices.",0

31665,"A kind friend gifted me this game, but I've had to ask for a refund.  The cats are absolutely tiny and difficult to see.  The game has an in house magnifying glass, but there is no facility to zoom in at all.
There are hidden cats which are difficult to find and you need to be very precise in your clicking.  I gave up when I had a hint and could not find the cat in the hint circle.
Not suitable for those with bad eyesight or poor motor skills.  There is a moving train and 2 cats to click on it. Possibly not suitable for those using a laptop like myself.  I decided not to give myself further eye strain although I love cats.",0
31666,"Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. 

It doesn't have mouse wheel zoom which is characteristic of major Hidden Object games. Instead, the HO items are too small and there is a magnifying glass for particular areas that doesn't zoom in properly as required for all HO games. 

Above all, the font in the game is atrocious. It makes understanding uneasy and literally confuses the players. 

Laush (the dev), after all the ordeal, you still haven't learned anything? If you create a zoom in (mouse wheel) and change the fonts, and the way the story is written, then you're all set!",0
31667,"I like HOG games, and have played several hidden cats games.
Only this one I made a refund request.
2 reasons: a) there is only this little magnifying glass..and it is a real hassle to search a whole screen with it;
b) the secret hidden cats....there is no sign that a cat is maybe hidden...so you [b]MUST[/b] click on everything in the hope 
to find them...and sometimes you even must click on the right spot.
No, sorry, there are better hidden/find cats around!!!",0
31668,"Cute, free, short find cats point&click game. The cat's are kinda small, which mades it a tiny bit harder than other similar - I didn't mind it tbh. I enjoyed the mini levels hidden in building and having to click stuff other than cats to get achievements. There were some cats hidden very well - to the point of having to click on tiny speck to unveil them.",1
31669,"I have played a lot of hidden item games and have to say that Cat City was one of the more challenging (borderline frustrating) ones that I have played. One of issues I had with the game was that some of the cats were very VERY small, even when using the in game magnifying glass- making them incredibly difficult to find. The second, more prominent, problem for me was that the points that you need to click on to interact with the scene or to find the cats is INCREDIBLY precise. This led to some occasions when the hint showed I had been clicking on the right item but the wrong part of it, or even situations where I found it very hard to find the cat even WITH the hint. Frequently, I ended up giving up and relying on the hint function (although I must admit that it was very good that hints were so readily available!)
I did however find the controls intuitive and easy to use, enjoyed the level structures (with the bonus items on each level) and liked the story aspect. If you want a challenging hidden object game then there's a good chance you would really enjoy this game, as I personally don't like them at this level of challenging, I didn't enjoy it as much.
I finished the entire game in about an hour however of course if you didn't use any hints it could take you much longer. Overall, I will say that I recommend it *if* you like challenging hidden object games but if you prefer an easier one then I'd look elsewhere.",1
31670,"I feel like this game is just a bad wannabe Dev Cats game. Yes there is a lot of content, and the cats aren't really easy to find.
But that's all the pros I can think about
- Not accessible to at least visually impaired people, as the contrast for the text is VERY VERY LOW. I can see just fine, and I had a really hard time deciphering what the cat was saying (white font, very light blue and purple text background)
- Talking about the cat, most of what she's saying makes no sense. There is a lot of repetitions, grammar and punctuation errors that makes the reading not really enjoyable. But I wouldn't mind as much, if only what she was saying had any sense at all! I got a very basic understanding of what the story was about, but it was only the case after reading the same thing paraphrased around 8 times total

[spoiler] Yes the message is good, it's important for people to know that black cats don't bring bad luck, but I don't believe it is necessary in a ""find cats"" game to repeat that you need to find cats in every new scene [/spoiler]

The sound settings should have a much bigger range of notches, the planes and other flying objects should fly less often, and the magnifying glass instead of an actual zoom is a good idea in theory but not in practice, as you have not only a very small area where you can search, but also because there is a big ahh stick in the middle of your screen

I almost regret paying 0.55‚Ç¨ for this game, as even in sale I am left with a bitter taste",0
31671,"[h1]IT COULD USE A FEW TWEAKS, OTHERWISE IT'S A FUN GAME[/h1]¬†
Cat City is by [b] Laush Studio[/b] the developer who created [b]In The Building Cats[/b] and the [b]Search All[/b] series. The game definitely has its flaws, but with a few tweaks, it would be an amazing game; in fact, it reminds me of one of my favorite cat games [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315450/Street_of_Secrets/]Street of Secrets[/url]¬†¬†

The main scene has 50 cats doing random cat things throughout the ""City."" Unfortunately, you can't scroll to make the scene larger, so the cats are super tiny and difficult to spot. There is a Magnifying glass located in the top right corner, but it's more frustrating than helpful when you have to search for teeny-tiny cats in a large city scene using a tiny magnified circle...still, it's doable, and the Hints are unlimited, with a fairly quick recharge.

There are 7 Buildings within the city that can be accessed (they will become outlined when you scan the mouse over them). Each building has 3 individual rooms containing 50 cats in total, some of which are hidden in or behind elements within the scene. There is a [b]Cat Counter Icon[/b] showing the total number of Cats and Hidden Cats.[b]TIP:[/b] Read over the Achievements before starting the game because there are specific objects to find within these rooms.

31672,"Firstly i have to say the idea of a city with different buildings that you can enter with multiple rooms is a cool take on this genre.
However the lack of a scroll function made this game ridiculously needlessly difficult( i'm aware there is a magnifying glass but that is a poor replacement for a standard mouse scroll function (some of the cats are absolutely tiny in the city.
Also  having cats hidden behind literally anything at all just creates a game where you're literally just clicking over the entire screen in hopes it moves something for the hidden cats to appear. This really killed the relaxing vibe these games are meant to give. It doesnt help that the achievements arent working either. Istill dont have one achievement despite me going back and clicking on the glasses over and over but the achievement doesnt unlock. Also why not just keep the mouse pointer as a standard one this games mouse pointer is awful.

All in all i play these games to destress or as a palate cleanser between other bigger games and if im getting stressed i'm not having fun then this is simply not a developer/publisher i will be coming back to.",0
31673,"Although the artstyle is beautiful and the cats are well hidden, I feel like this game has more cons than pros. I love the fact that it has a little story, but the font bothered me too much that I couldn`t even read it. My eyes hurt trying to focus on the text, so unfortunately I ended up skipping it (so idk if the story is interesting or not). Another thing that bothered me was not being able to zoom in using the mouse wheel. Maybe if you only had to search the apartments this would not have bothered me that much since you are provided with a magnifying glass, but you also have to search the city, and even with the magnifying glass you are not able to zoom in enough. 

However, I believe that these problems can be fixed in the developer`s future releases, so I am honestly looking forward to their future games and I am excited to see the improvements.",0
31674,"I'm not sure how a game can be so perfectly relaxing and infuriating at the same time. 
It took me a little over an hour to beat the game. It's the perfect way to kill time while you're sitting in vc chatting with your friends. 
None of the cats are impossible to find, I appreciate a game that doesn't force me to scroll through google & guides. 
My only critique is the dialogue. It feels impossibly long and the font isn't pleasing from a graphic design stand point. 
I hope this review provides some clarification in the midst of the negative ones! :D",1
31675,"Cat City reminds me of ""IN THE BUILDING: CATS 1, 2 and 3"" in a way that I really, really enjoy the aspect of this seek-and-find design.

I have played a ton of hidden cat games recently and I do really enjoy them but this and ITB:C are probably the neatest way to find cats. This one has a story with it, but it honestly makes no sense - probably due to poor translation, but at least it's a little extra something for the game.

The art is great, the music is good and the adventure for finding things is exciting! A lot of people have complained about controls, but I had no issue on a laptop. However, the main city is really small and hard to find things, even with the magnifying glass. I feel like sometimes it doesn't show the entire area with the glass even if you move slowly, so be warned about that. 

The game is really, really good and I would recommend it to others, but be warned about the small graphic issues if you have sensitive eyes or hands as you will be clicking things a lot.",1
31676,"I bought this based on my previous experience with the devs earlier games, most of which I enjoyed.

This game is another matter altogether; I found it frustrating due to poor technological implementation:
1) entering the buildings are not always being cooperative; it's not that they require a specific entry point (like a door or a window, and sometimes 1 click is enough, but sometimes 20 clicks are you're still outside;
2) my sound settings get reset to their defaults every time I re-open the game;
3) the ""special hidden"" cats require way too much pixel hunting; I had to use a hint in a few occasions despite having clicked frantically in that very spot... almost like some cats require 3 or 4 clicks before ""appearing""

On a different note, the story is quite heavy, dreary, and verbose... and it's using a terrible (but original) font in white letters over mostly pale blue backgrounds.

As a personal preference, so I can't blame the dev for trying something different, I prefer a zooming feature to a magnifying glass. That is extremely important when looking for the 50 cats across the city (not in the buildings.)

Overall, I cannot recommend this game as it's more frustrating than fun; I hope some technical improvements will be made on the next one!",0
31677,"Great for its genre, rooms had a fair amount of variety.

Cons:
- still lacks a proper zoom feature, which makes the main city level unplayable
- finding hidden cats eventually turns to pixel hunting, as some cats are only found by clicking on a small part of an object (i.e. clicking on a computer screen does not work, you must click on the computer's tiny power button to reveal the cat)",1
31678,i don't rly know maybe if the zoom mechanic woul get fixed to different thing from that magnifing glass the game would be more enjoyable coz the base city part is really just unsolvable without the hints. some cats are barely on the screen so yeah...different zoom option could make it more enjoyable otherwise i liked it,0
31679,"8/10 - It's a great game but their could be some additions, like increased zooming abilities and making the click radius of an object a bit larger. It's disheartening to have to click a very spesific button on a lamp that you can barely see even with the magnifying glass.",1
31680,"Too filled with confusing dialogue, bit of an unexpected dark turn, thought it was a Devcats game and was surprised by the lack of quality. The game is still pretty fun, cute and cheap, I just personally wouldn't play it again.",0

[b] I want to give a neutral recommendation. [/b]

This style of game has potential but needs some changes.

Same concept as the [b] In the Buildings [/b] games by this publisher which I enjoyed.

[b] ISSUES [/b]
The main street scene is too hard to search. The objects are way too small. It felt like pixel hunting and got really frustrating at times. There is a hint option which can be used without achievement penalty.

There's no mouse zoom, just a magnifying glass that doesn't enlarge the area enough. It's horrible to use.

White text on a pastel background does not work. I didn't bother reading it.

To enter the buildings the mouse has to be clicked multiple times. So annoying.",1
31683,"Do not like.

Seriously, it takes forever to find all the cats, some are very poorly hidden (as in, you can never find them without a hint) and at least half of the achievements aren't labeled well enough so you can't even obtain them.",0
31684,"Fun hidden objects game. Good art, well made, with a nice blend of obvious and hidden cats. Minor irritation is having to click the buildings many times to enter them, but otherwise a fun game.",1
31685,Very fun game with lots of maps. I love that the overworld also has hidden cats. Can't wait to play more games from this dev! :),1

31687,"[h1]Hidden Whisker-Worthy Twist![/h1]

Game has an innovative magnifying glass mechanic which adds a fresh layer of excitement to the search process, focusing your attention on small areas and making cat-spotting a breeze. While most of the city's cats are easy to find, the final batch presents a satisfying challenge, with a hint system available for those moments of frustration. 

Exploring the buildings in the city adds depth to the gameplay, though some hidden cats require precise clicking skills. The storyline, while skippable, offers a decent backdrop, and the music, albeit a bit eclectic at times, provides a pleasant atmosphere. For experienced hidden object enthusiasts, completing the game may take just an hour or two, but the potential for future building additions could elevate its replay value significantly.

[b]If you're passionate about hidden object games and have a soft spot for felines, this game is a worthwhile investment, especially if you catch it on sale. Get ready to sharpen your detective skills and embark on a cat-tastic adventure. [/b]",1

31700,"Wish I could help a developer by praising the game, saying the it's a rough, uncut gem. Unfortunately the game doesn't offer enough to elicit something positive for me to say.
- Graphic wise, it showcases original Doom's level of low rez textures, while somehow running sluggishly on a mid to high end rig
- Gameplay is repetitive and the story is not particularly original. There is no real sense of danger, so you just keep walking on, mildly enjoying the game attempts at jumpscares. It's also very short, might be a smart move to make it just long enough so you don't finish it before the refund window closes.
Bottom line, it needs a lot more work put into it to make it worthy of attention. Keep it up!",0
31701,This horror game was very engaging and offers a lot at a small price point would recommend.,1
31702,"Definitely a different horror experience than usual!
The impression is that there is much more than what you see at first glance. It certainly has some flaws on a technical level, but it manages to convey the right amount of anguish and discomfort typical of a nightmare and to make you scared 2/3 times.

I honestly feel like giving it a 6.5/10",1

31709,"This next episode in [i]The Lancaster Leak[/i] series is another encounter with an entity. But this time it is a different one. A significant change from [i]O'Brien State Park[/i] is that instead of first person we play in the 3rd person this time. We have a fixed camera angle system in place since according to the story this is still a found footage and the protagonist (Ashley) we see through the lens of the security cameras only.

The idea is great and moving around in the office reminded me of the gameplay in the first [i]Resident Evil[/i] game or we can mention the first [i]Castlevania[/i] released in 2013. In these games we move from screen to screen. Orientation can sometimes be difficult if the camera suddenly shows us from the different angle in the same room. I guess a lot of games were like this in the PS1 era, correct?

The good thing with [i]Crisis At Call Center[/i] is that it takes place in the same location. Overall, we follow the story of Ashley in 3 consecutive nights. She is someone who stays at the office for extra hours to increase her income. To do that she carries out extra chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. We always start in our ""cubicle"" as we have to look at the e-mail we receive to check what our job will be for the night. It's fun looking at an old Windows system - the story now takes place in the mid '90s. This also means that the VHS filter is not that strong. In fact, this is what [i]O'Brien State Park[/i] should have used.

Tension increases as the days (or nights) pass and the story (as you can guess) comes to a fatal conclusion on night 3. But this sequel is not just a story of another victim and another entity. No, this one does some more lore building which is fantastic. Also, the ending is suprising and really fun.

We are off to a really great start here with two found footage horror sims. The only issue I had was the several typos I found. This breaks the immersion - due to the VHS filter it's already a bit difficult to read but the errors are still noticeable. Hope the developer does more proofreading.",1
31710,"short game but should definitely be played, the atmosphere is incredible and it's one of the only indie horror games I've seen do the VHS filter correctly.

31712,"OOOOOOOOOOO I LIKE THIS GAME A LOT

the first Lancaster Leak was interesting enough, and although kinda slow and rather laggy, provided a solid short spook that acted as a jumping pad for something bigger.

This entry into the Lancaster Anthology has you playing from a fixed 3rd person perspective with tank controls, which I really enjoyed, (maybe I'm a shill for Silent Hill and RE but WHO CARES). I didn't realise this going into it however, as I didn't watch the trailer and the screenshots led me to believe it was a CCTV swapping sorta game, (kinda like I'm on Observation Duty). It's more than that however, and I welcomed it with open arms.

This game has a substantially substantial amount of substance, (nice), in comparison to the first outing, which in almost feels barren. Crisis at Call Centre however provides even more world-building, more tangible gameplay, (even though the controls may take some getting used to, and the game mainly consists of ""chores""), and a longer run time by about double the last game.
O'Brien State Park ran you a cool 15-20 minutes, whereas this new outing will take about 30-35, and for a free game with this much polish, I'll take that gladly.
I'm surprised at how invested I am into this universe you're creating as I've never really been a fan of SCP and stuff like that, but this has me gripped in a way I never imagined I'd experience.

The sound design in this game, and the previous, is just top notch. Absolutely stellar work. I found myself jumping at the sound of taps turning on and the slow and tedious ticking of old PCs. The entity in question is scary in concept and that ending definitely made me p!ss myself a little, but I feel like if it was left more-so in the dark it would be more effective in-game.

This outing also runs significantly better than the last and the VHS grain filter didn't give me vertigo so props for optimisation <3

I love this game, this series and I absolutely CANNOT wait for Entity Exam. I will be keeping a keen eye out for it!

9/10

31713,"Though I really like the way this game has been stylized, the tanky controls and and empty gameplay left me more bored than scared. Whatever scare factor the antagonist has is hampered by its janky animations and the jumpscare at the end is pretty nonsensical.
Fine for what it is as a free game, but I wouldn't have put down money for it.",0
31714,"Feel bad for the bad rating but the controls are awful and confusing, and needs more clear instructions. I got stuck. The concept and art is awesome but its needs improvement.",0
31715,"The Lancaster Leak - Crisis At Call Center was a surprisingly enjoyable experience. This was my first time playing a game in the series, and I'm already eager to see where the story goes next. The game-play is relatively short, but it left me wanting more. While some might find the hidden object sections a bit tricky, I didn't mind the extra challenge. I'm hoping they'll add even more content in future installments to keep things interesting.  I'm not usually a fan of the VHS filter style, but I thought it was used effectively here and added to the game's atmosphere. Overall, I didn't expect to have as much fun as I did with ""The Lancaster Leak - Crisis At Call Center"", and I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for future releases in the series.",1
31716,"PS1-style horror games are popping up everywhere, but the Lancaster Leak series stands out from the crowd with how it experiments with the concept of a found footage horror game. O'Brien State Park was a pretty straightforward walking simulator, but Crisis at Call Center takes an old school tank controls fixed camera perspective under the guise of a collection of security cam footage.

Jeremy Fischer approaches lore building in a way that draws the player in. Phone calls, camera footage, and government files are mashed up to create a wild story that had me anxious to find out what would happen next. It reminds me of the film Noroi: The Curse, taking all sorts of media and mashing it into a wild, horrific document.

I can't wait to see where this series is going!

31717,THE LANCASTER LEAK - Crisis at Call Center is my personal favourite of the lancaster leak games. The gameplay is shot entirely through security cameras as you work night shifts cleaning an office building. This game has a lot of intense puzzles and mechanics that would intice all gamers. Please,1
31718,"The game within itself would deserve a solid 4/10 as of now, my only request to the developer is to flesh out the walking controls a bit more, as they are very wonky when you're trying to run from the entity, a skip button for areas where only text is presented would be nice as well. Thank you.
tldr: fix walking controls and add skip button to certain areas.",0
31719,"Yeah, that was good fun. A significant improvement on the first in the series. Good use of fixed multicam, fun solution to the door problem, the windows clone is simple but effective, decently creepy monster behavior, great application of the VHS aesthetic, solid jumpscare. Playtime of ~30 minutes, worth a look...!

Typos take the shine off the framing device a bit, but you have to admire its utility in directing the player (on-screen past-tense captions). Not sure I'm that keen on the framing device as a *story* though - it's not like we haven't seen this stuff a bunch of times before.

All this said, however, I'd love to see the developer doing more with fixed multicam, I think they've a definite talent there!",1

31722,"If you want a short horror game that recreates the feel of analog horror, this is the game for you.

This game effectively creates the atmosphere of analog horror and turns it into a playable experience.

The tension builds at a good pace and the story continuing off of the previous game has left me excited for the next game in the series.",1
31723,I liked this one more than the first. It's a more ambitious title compared to the linear 1st person first game although I think it does a great job of continuing what made the first game so great. Only criticisms would be some slightly janky animations here & there. My favourite aspect was how it greatly expanded on the story and brought more depth to the world-building.,1
31724,"An interesting point of view concept, playing through the guise of watching security footage.
My biggest complaint was the controls. Moving around was horribly clunky and it's a good thing you don't need agility or speed for anything. I play exclusively on the steam deck and found assigning the Dpad as WASD worked best.
It was kinda annoying you couldn't pick up all the plates at once or wash them all at once.",1
31725,"While better in certain aspects compared to the first game, this one is barely better. The controls aren‚Äôt that great (I moonwalked the entire game) and clunky.

Great development of the ongoing story and establishing ""who's who"" in the background. 8/10 and can't wait to see more.  Time for round three!",1
31732,Definitely worth a play; short creepy game. I like the atmosphere it creates. I played the previous one and I am liking the story line that is unfolding.,1

31734,"While short, this game makes up for it by using jump scares that get your heart racing. The concept is great and the story kept me glued to the screen until it was over. 

I do have a few critiques/notes; 

- There are no instructions on how to move, which was frustrating, but at least I knew how to perform an action (E) and how to exit the computer/get to the game menu (esc)

- You're told how to run (shift) at the end of the game, but I didn't see the point in running since the creature never got close to me

- I'm confused about why the gate in the alleyway is closed on the first night and open for the rest of the game. You can't interact with it, sadly, but I would've liked to by performing actions like closing the gate or using it as an alternate exit route

- There are some spelling errors that pulled my focus away from the game play

Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game with simple controls (perfect for beginners) and a story that still captures your attention like a longer, more complex game would.",1
31735,"I liked the game, but the controls were not implemented in the best of ways. The character turns around too fast and I kept hitting walls while walking and running. The soudunds were also not equilized very well, some were too loud while others were too quiet, in my opinion. 

But It's a pretty horror short game, third person with fixed camera, it reminds me of the early resindent evil games, but here is stated the whole foootage is captured through the installed cameras and I think this is just brilliant, and the whole way the story is told is pretty masterfully done. Also the atmosphere is great, I loved the parts with the flashlight.

Recommended!",1
31736,"I like the story behind it, I just wish that it had more to do in it then just doing chores. Maybe instead of just doing dishes and taking out trash we could unclog toilets or wipe down mirrors because then there is some variety. The taking out the trash got very old, very fast.

31741,"96% Score - Finished at 20 Minutes

Gameplay (1.5/2): I love the switch from first-person to tank controlled third-person! It works super well within the setting of the gameplay- not spending too much time in one area, or too sluggish time in another. I don't think the gameplay does anything particularly new as it consists of chores, edging into the eventual horror. But it does provide a short encapsulating experience that doesn't feel like a slog.

Story (1.5/2): As best as I can say- I don't think its doing anything groundbreaking but players will still be drawn in to the short yet unique sequences of gameplay. The writing has a draw that when gameplay is happening you're seeing a short series of events that don't feel drawn out. But as if you are learning about 'the entity' as the last series entry also followed. However, I found this experience much more enthralling and still recommend some indie horror fans to check out.

Writing (2/2): For a game like this, the writing isn't anything intensive. But it fits the genre style it's going for, doing so exceptionally. The uneasy slides in reading about 'the entity' always makes me curious about the next gameplay cycle or 'footage' we play. I think that's easily the best draw to this game is eating the trail of crumbs (building anticipation).

Visuals (1.75/2): The visual aesthetic works great- fitting back to its first entry. I do have one complaint- just the walking cycle felt strange and I wouldn't have complained the character moved just a small amount slower to really fit the animation. Otherwise some of the animations like the garbage throwing made me giggle every time. But no real issues with the visuals, works well.

Audio (2/2): While audio was a larger issue to me in the first game, it felt far more fit to the ambiance in this entry. It works very well, feeling that VHS static within the unorthodox style of tape footage. No complaints here- wonderful job with the atmosphere! Also compliments to the main voice actress, genuinely felt S tier and made me uncomfortable.

Game Bug - I know this is a new game. On night 3 I walked into the door of the security room to see if I could see the guy inside and I got the camera but my character was on the other side and I could not get the camera to change and had to restart.",1
31748,"Just played this on Youtube (link below for those who want to see a gameplay sample before buying), and I thought it was a good sequel to The Lancaster Leak - O'Brien State Park. It doesn't directly follow on from the story of the previous game, but it is set in the same timeline. It also incorporates some gameplay differences; Crisis at Call Center is third- rather than first-person, using a Resident Evil-style series of fixed cameras as you navigate your environment. These camera angles work well with the controls to ensure the gameplay mechanics work smoothly.

Visual and sound design has been handled well, giving the game a sufficient degree of spooky atmosphere to creep the player out. The story this time around is that you're reviewing security footage from an office building, where a member of staff was killed by a monstrous entity. The game is only short (about half an hour) so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

Overall, I'd recommend this game; it was a decent way to spend half an hour, and I look forward to seeing what other instalments in The Lancaster Leaks series might be released in future.

It's awesome and I can feel love from other series inspiring this work, it's easy on the hardware so please get it a try!",1
31752,"(HEADS UP: This review was written on the day of release. Things may have changed between release and the time you are seeing this, so take these things with a grain of salt as they may have been fixed by the time you read this.)

This game is very much a mixed bag for me. Many of my issues are personal preferences and gripes, however this is my review, so I will list those here. This monster of a review will be split into multiple parts, so for the dumbed down version, scroll to the bottom, although for more specifics, I definitely recommend reading the whole thing.

*Graphics/Performance:* Now, this game is styled to look like something out of an early PS1 game, meaning the graphics by todays standards are not greatest, however, that is the style the game is going for, so I have no complaints there. My complaints are with the game's performance. For a game with such low poly textures and models (At least from what is visible through all the screen effects), trying to run this game on a Mac like me, on any setting higher than ""Low"" is unbearable. The game stutters like crazy and just runs really slow unless you're on a low setting and even then, it still still has fps drops. (For reference, I can run games like ""The Forest"" just fine with little to no FPS drops ever). The original Lancaster leak had this same problem, but it was a lot worse, so there seems to have been an effort to fix this. Either way, I give the graphics a good 7/10, and the performance a 4/10.

*Controls:* This game has tank controls, which for a lot of people could be an immediate turn off. For me tank controls are a little annoying but I can bear them. The problem with this however, is the fact that if you are walking towards the camera, your controls will inverse, so instead of turning right you will turn left for example. It's not a huge thing but gets really annoying at times. Overall I give the controls a 5/10

*Gameplay:* Another little gripe I have with this game is the gameplay. This game is comprised of multiple fetch quests. However the original Lancaster Leak was a glorified walking simulator so either way this is an improvement. But in the original I could excuse the lack of any real gameplay because of how excellently done the horror element was, but in this game, the horror element is kind of lackluster. I did not once find the entity scary, as there was never a moment in the game where it could actually kill you if it you were chased, and it only ever showed up during scripted sequences, making it seem much less scary. I would have loved if there was a portion of the game where the entity was wandering around, and you had to hide in lockers or something whenever it walked by, however that would require a much larger map, so it probably would not have worked. I give the gameplay a 7/10. It was fun for the first 10 or so minutes, but then it got very repetitive.

*Lore/Story:* This is the game's saving grace. The lore is very intriguing and the entity description and how the story was presented is absolutely perfect. On top of that the voice acting is absolutely incredible, it is seriously impressive the emotion that the character managed to convey in the very few lines they had. I give this section a 10/10

*Conclusion:* Overall, this game is a 6.6/10. The graphics fit the theme of the game, however the performance is absolutely atrocious at times, which takes away from it, the controls are annoying and janky, and the gameplay is very mediocre (However it is still an improvement over the gameplay from the last one). This game is absolutely saved by it's very well presented story. While it does have it's problems, it's only worth it due to the fact that it is free. If this even cost a dollar, I would say its not worth the money, dont buy it, but like I said it's free. So yeah, 6.6/10.

                                                                     -- BUGS/PROBLEMS --
-During the first appearance of the entity, the character does not look at it when it plays the weird frightened animations, which takes away from the immersion.

-During the ending cutscene, where the entity kills everybody in the call center, you can see both the hands of the entity and the hands of the body clipping through the exit door in the alley camera angle.

-You can grab the meeting room trash through the wall.

-There are multiple typo's throughout the many text sections of the game.",1

No score, no real objective at all.  You can shuffle the cards at will until you get a low card so you'll always guess correctly as well.  Granted, you can guess ""black"" or ""higher"" until you get through the entire deck.. but WHY!?!?  ...How is this ""fun""?!?

And with a price tag of $5 USD, I'm just left scratching my head.  This isn't a game that is trying to make a fun compelling game by 'keeping it simple', instead this is just laziness in abundance.  


NOT RECOMMENDED.    Even if this game were only a nickel, it would still not be worth it or the time you'd waste playing it.",0
